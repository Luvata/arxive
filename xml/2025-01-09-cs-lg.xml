      <title>AI-ANNE: (A) (N)eural (N)et for (E)xploration: Transferring Deep Learning Models onto Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This working paper explores the integration of neural networks onto resource-constrained embedded systems like a Raspberry Pi Pico / Raspberry Pi Pico 2. A TinyML aproach transfers neural networks directly on these microcontrollers, enabling real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient inference while maintaining data privacy. Therefore, AI-ANNE: (A) (N)eural (N)et for (E)xploration will be presented, which facilitates the transfer of pre-trained models from high-performance platforms like TensorFlow and Keras onto microcontrollers, using a lightweight programming language like MicroPython. This approach demonstrates how neural network architectures, such as neurons, layers, density and activation functions can be implemented in MicroPython in order to deal with the computational limitations of embedded systems. Based on the Raspberry Pi Pico / Raspberry Pi Pico 2, two different neural networks on microcontrollers are presented for an example of data classification. As an further application example, such a microcontroller can be used for condition monitoring, where immediate corrective measures are triggered on the basis of sensor data. Overall, this working paper presents a very easy-to-implement way of using neural networks on energy-efficient devices such as microcontrollers. This makes AI-ANNE: (A) (N)eural (N)et for (E)xploration not only suited for practical use, but also as an educational tool with clear insights into how neural networks operate.</description>

      <title>Bridge the Inference Gaps of Neural Processes via Expectation Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural process (NP) is a family of computationally efficient models for learning distributions over functions. However, it suffers from under-fitting and shows suboptimal performance in practice. Researchers have primarily focused on incorporating diverse structural inductive biases, \textit{e.g.} attention or convolution, in modeling. The topic of inference suboptimality and an analysis of the NP from the optimization objective perspective has hardly been studied in earlier work. To fix this issue, we propose a surrogate objective of the target log-likelihood of the meta dataset within the expectation maximization framework. The resulting model, referred to as the Self-normalized Importance weighted Neural Process (SI-NP), can learn a more accurate functional prior and has an improvement guarantee concerning the target log-likelihood. Experimental results show the competitive performance of SI-NP over other NPs objectives and illustrate that structural inductive biases, such as attention modules, can also augment our method to achieve SOTA performance. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/hhq123gogogo/SI_NPs}.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Edge AI: A Comprehensive Survey on Data, Model, and System Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 5G and edge computing hardware has brought about a significant shift in artificial intelligence, with edge AI becoming a crucial technology for enabling intelligent applications. With the growing amount of data generated and stored on edge devices, deploying AI models for local processing and inference has become increasingly necessary. However, deploying state-of-the-art AI models on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges that must be addressed. This paper presents an optimization triad for efficient and reliable edge AI deployment, including data, model, and system optimization. First, we discuss optimizing data through data cleaning, compression, and augmentation to make it more suitable for edge deployment. Second, we explore model design and compression methods at the model level, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. Finally, we introduce system optimization techniques like framework support and hardware acceleration to accelerate edge AI workflows. Based on an in-depth analysis of various application scenarios and deployment challenges of edge AI, this paper proposes an optimization paradigm based on the data-model-system triad to enable a whole set of solutions to effectively transfer ML models, which are initially trained in the cloud, to various edge devices for supporting multiple scenarios.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Pre-training Based Model for Secure and Efficient Prediction of Default Risk Propagation among Bond Issuers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient prediction of default risk for bond-issuing enterprises is pivotal for maintaining stability and fostering growth in the bond market. Conventional methods usually rely solely on an enterprise's internal data for risk assessment. In contrast, graph-based techniques leverage interconnected corporate information to enhance default risk identification for targeted bond issuers. Traditional graph techniques such as label propagation algorithm or deepwalk fail to effectively integrate a enterprise's inherent attribute information with its topological network data. Additionally, due to data scarcity and security privacy concerns between enterprises, end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) algorithms may struggle in delivering satisfactory performance for target tasks. To address these challenges, we present a novel two-stage model. In the first stage, we employ an innovative Masked Autoencoders for Heterogeneous Graph (HGMAE) to pre-train on a vast enterprise knowledge graph. Subsequently, in the second stage, a specialized classifier model is trained to predict default risk propagation probabilities. The classifier leverages concatenated feature vectors derived from the pre-trained encoder with the enterprise's task-specific feature vectors. Through the two-stage training approach, our model not only boosts the importance of unique bond characteristics for specific default prediction tasks, but also securely and efficiently leverage the global information pre-trained from other enterprises. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing approaches in predicting default risk for bond issuers.</description>

      <title>A Semantically-Aware, Kernel-Enhanced, and Divergence-Rich Paradigm for Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked many applications but also underscores the challenge of aligning them with diverse values and preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is central to alignment but constrained by fixed divergences and limited feature transformations. We propose DPO-Kernels, which integrates kernel methods to address these issues through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations with polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer transformations, plus a hybrid loss combining embedding-based and probability-based objectives; (ii) Divergence Alternatives (Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Renyi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and f-divergences) for greater stability; (iii) Data-Driven Selection metrics that automatically choose the best kernel-divergence pair; and (iv) a Hierarchical Mixture of Kernels for both local precision and global modeling. Evaluations on 12 datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in factuality, safety, reasoning, and instruction following. Grounded in Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, DPO-Kernels maintains robust generalization for LLMs, offering a comprehensive resource for further alignment research.</description>

      <title>Strategic Fusion Optimizes Transformer Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates transformer model compression by systematically pruning its layers. We evaluated 14 pruning strategies across nine diverse datasets, including 12 strategies based on different signals obtained from layer activations, mutual information, gradients, weights, and attention. To address the limitations of single-signal strategies, we introduced two fusion strategies, linear regression and random forest, which combine individual strategies (i.e., strategic fusion), for more informed pruning decisions. Additionally, we applied knowledge distillation to mitigate any accuracy loss during layer pruning. Our results reveal that random forest strategic fusion outperforms individual strategies in seven out of nine datasets and achieves near-optimal performance in the other two. The distilled random forest surpasses the original accuracy in six datasets and mitigates accuracy drops in the remaining three. Knowledge distillation also improves the accuracy-to-size ratio by an average factor of 18.84 across all datasets. Supported by mathematical foundations and biological analogies, our findings suggest that strategically combining multiple signals can lead to efficient, high-performing transformer models for resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Sensorformer: Cross-patch attention with global-patch compression is effective for high-dimensional multivariate time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the existing Transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting methods, iTransformer, which treats each variable sequence as a token and only explicitly extracts cross-variable dependencies, and PatchTST, which adopts a channel-independent strategy and only explicitly extracts cross-time dependencies, both significantly outperform most Channel-Dependent Transformer that simultaneously extract cross-time and cross-variable dependencies. This indicates that existing Transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting methods still struggle to effectively fuse these two types of information. We attribute this issue to the dynamic time lags in the causal relationships between different variables. Therefore, we propose a new multivariate time series forecasting Transformer, Sensorformer, which first compresses the global patch information and then simultaneously extracts cross-variable and cross-time dependencies from the compressed representations. Sensorformer can effectively capture the correct inter-variable correlations and causal relationships, even in the presence of dynamic causal lags between variables, while also reducing the computational complexity of pure cross-patch self-attention from $O(D^2 \cdot Patch\_num^2 \cdot d\_model)$ to $O(D^2 \cdot Patch\_num \cdot d\_model)$. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on 9 mainstream real-world multivariate time series forecasting datasets demonstrate the superiority of Sensorformer. The implementation of Sensorformer, following the style of the Time-series-library and scripts for reproducing the main results, is publicly available at https://github.com/BigYellowTiger/Sensorformer</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Optimal Stern Shape with Convolutional Neural Network-based Pressure Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hull form designing is an iterative process wherein the performance of the hull form needs to be checked via computational fluid dynamics calculations or model experiments. The stern shape has to undergo a process wherein the hull form variations from the pressure distribution analysis results are repeated until the resistance and propulsion efficiency meet the design requirements. In this study, the designer designed a pressure distribution that meets the design requirements; this paper proposes an inverse design algorithm that estimates the stern shape using deep learning. A convolutional neural network was used to extract the features of the pressure distribution expressed as a contour, whereas a multi-task learning model was used to estimate various sections of the stern shape. We estimated the stern shape indirectly by estimating the control point of the B-spline and comparing the actual and converted offsets for each section; the performance was verified, and an inverse design is proposed herein</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning of Pretrained Transformer via Differential Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large transformers have demonstrated remarkable success, making it necessary to compress these models to reduce inference costs while preserving their perfor-mance. Current compression algorithms prune transformers at fixed compression ratios, requiring a unique pruning process for each ratio, which results in high computational costs. In contrast, we propose pruning of pretrained transformers at any desired ratio within a single pruning stage, based on a differential inclusion for a mask parameter. This dynamic can generate the whole regularization solution path of the mask parameter, whose support set identifies the network structure. Therefore, the solution path identifies a Transformer weight family with various sparsity levels, offering greater flexibility and customization. In this paper, we introduce such an effective pruning method, termed SPP (Solution Path Pruning). To achieve effective pruning, we segment the transformers into paired modules, including query-key pairs, value-projection pairs, and sequential linear layers, and apply low-rank compression to these pairs, maintaining the output structure while enabling structural compression within the inner states. Extensive experiments conducted on various well-known transformer backbones have demonstrated the efficacy of SPP.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Based Heterogenous Graph Attention Network for Multi-Class Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising tool for addressing fake news detection is Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNN-based methods rely on binary classification, categorizing news as either real or fake. Additionally, traditional GNN models use a static neighborhood for each node, making them susceptible to issues like over-squashing. In this paper, we introduce a novel model named Decision-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (DHGAT) for fake news detection in a semi-supervised setting. DHGAT effectively addresses the limitations of traditional GNNs by dynamically optimizing and selecting the neighborhood type for each node in every layer. It represents news data as a heterogeneous graph where nodes (news items) are connected by various types of edges. The architecture of DHGAT consists of a decision network that determines the optimal neighborhood type and a representation network that updates node embeddings based on this selection. As a result, each node learns an optimal and task-specific computational graph, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of the fake news detection process. We evaluate DHGAT on the LIAR dataset, a large and challenging dataset for multi-class fake news detection, which includes news items categorized into six classes. Our results demonstrate that DHGAT outperforms existing methods, improving accuracy by approximately 4% and showing robustness with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal One-Shot Federated Ensemble Learning for Medical Data with Vision Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted considerable interest in the medical domain due to its capacity to facilitate collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy. However, conventional FL methods typically necessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication overhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth. One-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training and aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication costs while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble learning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques such as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the other hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use unimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the integration of multi-modal data is proposed to address these shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce FedMME, an innovative one-shot multi-modal federated ensemble learning framework that utilizes multi-modal data for medical image analysis. Specifically, FedMME capitalizes on vision large language models to produce textual reports from medical images, employs a BERT model to extract textual features from these reports, and amalgamates these features with visual features to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing one-shot federated learning methods in healthcare scenarios across four datasets with various data distributions. For instance, it surpasses existing one-shot federated learning approaches by more than 17.5% in accuracy on the RSNA dataset when applying a Dirichlet distribution with ($\alpha$ = 0.3).</description>

      <title>A Soft Sensor Method with Uncertainty-Awareness and Self-Explanation Based on Large Language Models Enhanced by Domain Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven soft sensors are crucial in predicting key performance indicators in industrial systems. However, current methods predominantly rely on the supervised learning paradigms of parameter updating, which inherently faces challenges such as high development costs, poor robustness, training instability, and lack of interpretability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, notably through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables high-performance task execution with minimal input-label demonstrations and no prior training. This paper aims to replace supervised learning with the emerging ICL paradigm for soft sensor modeling to address existing challenges and explore new avenues for advancement. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Few-shot Uncertainty-aware and self-Explaining Soft Sensor (LLM-FUESS), which includes the Zero-shot Auxiliary Variable Selector (LLM-ZAVS) and the Uncertainty-aware Few-shot Soft Sensor (LLM-UFSS). The LLM-ZAVS retrieves from the Industrial Knowledge Vector Storage to enhance LLMs' domain-specific knowledge, enabling zero-shot auxiliary variable selection. In the LLM-UFSS, we utilize text-based context demonstrations of structured data to prompt LLMs to execute ICL for predicting and propose a context sample retrieval augmentation strategy to improve performance. Additionally, we explored LLMs' AIGC and probabilistic characteristics to propose self-explanation and uncertainty quantification methods for constructing a trustworthy soft sensor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, strong robustness, and flexibility, effectively mitigates training instability found in traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish soft sensor utilizing LLMs.</description>

      <title>Method of data forward generation with partial differential equations for machine learning modeling in fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) for fluid mechanics has become attractive topic. High-fidelity data is one of most critical issues for the successful applications of AI in fluid mechanics, however, it is expensively obtained or even inaccessible. This study proposes a high-efficient data forward generation method from the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, the solutions of the PDEs are first generated either following a random field (e.g. Gaussian random field, GRF, computational complexity O(NlogN), N is the number of spatial points) or physical laws (e.g. a kind of spectra, computational complexity O(NM), M is the number of modes), then the source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions are computed to satisfy PDEs. Thus, the data pairs of source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions with corresponding solutions of PDEs can be constructed. A Poisson neural network (Poisson-NN) embedded in projection method and a wavelet transform convolutional neuro network (WTCNN) embedded in multigrid numerical simulation for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is respectively proposed. The feasibility of generated data for training Poisson-NN and WTCNN is validated. The results indicate that even without any DNS data, the generated data can train these two models with excellent generalization and accuracy. The data following physical laws can significantly improve the convergence rate, generalization and accuracy than that generated following GRF.</description>

Abstract: Lithology discrimination is a crucial activity in characterizing oil reservoirs, and processing lithology microscopic images is an essential technique for investigating fossils and minerals and geological assessment of shale oil exploration. In this way, Deep Learning (DL) technique is a powerful approach for building robust classifier models. However, there is still a considerable challenge to collect and produce a large dataset. Transfer-learning and data augmentation techniques have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this problem. Furthermore, due to different reasons, especially data privacy, individuals, organizations, and industry companies often are not willing to share their sensitive data and information. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to train a highly accurate central model across multiple decentralized edge servers without transferring sensitive data, preserving sensitive data, and enhancing security. This study involves two phases; the first phase is to conduct Lithology microscopic image classification on a small dataset using transfer learning. In doing so, various pre-trained DL model architectures are comprehensively compared for the classification task. In the second phase, we formulated the classification task to a Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) scheme and proposed a Fine-Tuned Aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (FTA-FTL). In order to perform a comprehensive experimental study, several metrics such as accuracy, f1 score, precision, specificity, sensitivity (recall), and confusion matrix are taken into account. The results are in excellent agreement and confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and show that the proposed FTA-FTL algorithm is capable enough to achieve approximately the same results obtained by the centralized implementation for Lithology microscopic images classification task.</description>

      <title>Detecting Defective Wafers Via Modular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing availability of sensors within semiconductor manufacturing processes makes it feasible to detect defective wafers with data-driven models. Without directly measuring the quality of semiconductor devices, they capture the modalities between diverse sensor readings and can be used to predict key quality indicators (KQI, \textit{e.g.}, roughness, resistance) to detect faulty products, significantly reducing the capital and human cost in maintaining physical metrology steps. Nevertheless, existing models pay little attention to the correlations among different processes for diverse wafer products and commonly struggle with generalizability issues. To enable generic fault detection, in this work, we propose a modular network (MN) trained using time series stage-wise datasets that embodies the structure of the manufacturing process. It decomposes KQI prediction as a combination of stage modules to simulate compositional semiconductor manufacturing, universally enhancing faulty wafer detection among different wafer types and manufacturing processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, and shed light on how the compositional design provides an interpretable interface for more practical applications.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fair Federated Learning via Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), heterogeneity among the local dataset distributions of clients can result in unsatisfactory performance for some, leading to an unfair model. To address this challenge, we propose an over-the-air fair federated learning algorithm (OTA-FFL), which leverages over-the-air computation to train fair FL models. By formulating FL as a multi-objective minimization problem, we introduce a modified Chebyshev approach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation in each communication round. To enable efficient aggregation over the multiple access channel, we derive analytical solutions for the optimal transmit scalars at the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OTA-FFL in achieving fairness and robust performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Order Flow Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification in Disturbed Aerodynamics Using Sparse Pressure Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel machine-learning framework for reconstructing low-order gust-encounter flow field and lift coefficients from sparse, noisy surface pressure measurements. Our study thoroughly investigates the time-varying response of sensors to gust-airfoil interactions, uncovering valuable insights into optimal sensor placement. To address uncertainties in deep learning predictions, we implement probabilistic regression strategies to model both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty, reflecting the model's confidence in its predictions, is modeled using Monte Carlo dropout, as an approximation to the variational inference in the Bayesian framework, treating the neural network as a stochastic entity. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty, arising from noisy input measurements, is captured via learned statistical parameters, which propagates measurement noise through the network into the final predictions. Our results showcase the efficacy of this dual uncertainty quantification strategy in accurately predicting aerodynamic behavior under extreme conditions while maintaining computational efficiency, underscoring its potential to improve online sensor-based flow estimation in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, particularly those that incorporate Transformer architectures, have demonstrated exceptional performance in domains such as natural language processing and image processing. Adapting these models to structured data, like tables, however, introduces significant challenges. These difficulties are even more pronounced when addressing multi-table data linked via foreign key, which is prevalent in the enterprise realm and crucial for empowering business use cases. Despite its substantial impact, research focusing on such linked business tables within enterprise settings remains a significantly important yet underexplored domain. To address this, we introduce a curated dataset sourced from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, featuring extensive linked tables. This dataset is specifically designed to support research endeavors in table representation learning. By providing access to authentic enterprise data, our goal is to potentially enhance the effectiveness and applicability of models for real-world business contexts.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Graph Transformers for Interpretable Particle Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in AI-driven discoveries.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Generative Artificial Intelligence for Rapid Takeoff Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To aid urban air mobility (UAM), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are being targeted. Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Value of Learning in Task-Oriented Federated Meta-Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its distributed nature and privacy preserving benefits. However, a key limitation of conventional FL is that it learns and distributes a common global model to all participants, which fails to provide customized solutions for diverse task requirements. Federated meta-learning (FML) offers a promising solution to this issue by enabling devices to finetune local models after receiving a shared meta-model from the server. In this paper, we propose a task-oriented FML framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. A novel metric, termed value of learning (VoL), is introduced to assess the individual training needs across devices. Moreover, a task-level weight (TLW) metric is defined based on task requirements and fairness considerations, guiding the prioritization of edge devices during FML training. The formulated problem, to maximize the sum of TLW-based VoL across devices, forms a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) challenge, addressed here using a parameterized deep Q-network (PDQN) algorithm to handle both discrete and continuous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline schemes, underscoring the advantages of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Radar Signal Recognition through Self-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making processes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR performance in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated RF data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to enhance RSR performance in environments with limited RF samples and labels. Specifically, we investigate pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from various RF domains and subsequently transfer the learned representation to the radar domain, where annotated data are limited. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5\% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31\% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without SSL. We also provide reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Neural Network (BNN) converts full-precision weights and activations into their extreme 1-bit counterparts, making it particularly suitable for deployment on lightweight mobile devices. While binary neural networks are typically formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized in the binarized space, general neural networks are formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem and optimized in the continuous space. This paper introduces the Hyperbolic Binary Neural Network (HBNN) by leveraging the framework of hyperbolic geometry to optimize the constrained problem. Specifically, we transform the constrained problem in hyperbolic space into an unconstrained one in Euclidean space using the Riemannian exponential map. On the other hand, we also propose the Exponential Parametrization Cluster (EPC) method, which, compared to the Riemannian exponential map, shrinks the segment domain based on a diffeomorphism. This approach increases the probability of weight flips, thereby maximizing the information gain in BNNs. Experimental results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGGsmall, ResNet18, and ResNet34 models illustrate the superior performance of our HBNN over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing privacy concerns and unrestricted access to data lead to the development of a novel machine learning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL). FL borrows many of the ideas from distributed machine learning, however, the challenges associated with federated learning makes it an interesting engineering problem since the models are trained on edge devices. It was introduced in 2016 by Google, and since then active research is being carried out in different areas within FL such as federated optimization algorithms, model and update compression, differential privacy, robustness, and attacks, federated GANs and privacy preserved personalization. There are many open challenges in the development of such federated machine learning systems and this project will be focusing on the communication bottleneck and data Non IID-ness, and its effect on the performance of the models. These issues are characterized on a baseline model, model performance is evaluated, and discussions are made to overcome these issues.</description>

      <title>Align-Pro: A Principled Approach to Prompt Optimization for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical as these models become increasingly integrated into various societal and decision-making processes. Traditional methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), achieve alignment by fine-tuning model parameters, but these approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical when models are frozen or inaccessible for parameter modification. In contrast, prompt optimization is a viable alternative to RLHF for LLM alignment. While the existing literature has shown empirical promise of prompt optimization, its theoretical underpinning remains under-explored. We address this gap by formulating prompt optimization as an optimization problem and try to provide theoretical insights into the optimality of such a framework. To analyze the performance of the prompt optimization, we study theoretical suboptimality bounds and provide insights in terms of how prompt optimization depends upon the given prompter and target model. We also provide empirical validation through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that prompt optimization can effectively align LLMs, even when parameter fine-tuning is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Guided Attention for Private LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasiveness of proprietary language models has raised critical privacy concerns, necessitating advancements in private inference (PI), where computations are performed directly on encrypted data without revealing users' sensitive information. While PI offers a promising solution, its practical deployment is hindered by substantial communication and latency overheads, primarily stemming from nonlinear operations. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to characterize the role of nonlinearities in decoder-only language models, laying a principled foundation for optimizing transformer-architectures tailored to the demands of PI.
  By leveraging Shannon's entropy as a quantitative measure, we uncover the previously unexplored dual significance of nonlinearities: beyond ensuring training stability, they are crucial for maintaining attention head diversity. Specifically, we find that their removal triggers two critical failure modes: {\em entropy collapse} in deeper layers that destabilizes training, and {\em entropic overload} in earlier layers that leads to under-utilization of Multi-Head Attention's (MHA) representational capacity.
  We propose an entropy-guided attention mechanism paired with a novel entropy regularization technique to mitigate entropic overload. Additionally, we explore PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy collapse and stabilizing the training of LLMs with reduced-nonlinearities. Our study bridges the gap between information theory and architectural design, establishing entropy dynamics as a principled guide for developing efficient PI architectures. The code and implementation are available at \href{https://github.com/Nandan91/entropy-guided-attention-llm}{entropy-guided-llm}.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Urban Traffic Flow Forecasting with Drone and Loop Detector Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting is a fundamental task in transportation research, however the scope of current research has mainly focused on a single data modality of loop detectors. Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have made possible novel solutions for efficient, accurate and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drone-captured data can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of multi-source traffic speed prediction, simultaneously using drone and loop detector data. A simple yet effective graph-based model HiMSNet is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestions and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverages and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the added value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning within Tabular Data: Foundations, Challenges, Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent data types across a wide range of real-world applications, yet effective representation learning for this domain poses unique challenges due to its irregular patterns, heterogeneous feature distributions, and complex inter-column dependencies. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques in tabular data representation learning, structured around three foundational design elements: training data, neural architectures, and learning objectives. Unlike prior surveys that focus primarily on either architecture design or learning strategies, we adopt a holistic perspective that emphasizes the universality and robustness of representation learning methods across diverse downstream tasks. We examine recent advances in data augmentation and generation, specialized neural network architectures tailored to tabular data, and innovative learning objectives that enhance representation quality. Additionally, we highlight the growing influence of self-supervised learning and the adaptation of transformer-based foundation models for tabular data.

      <title>Rethinking Adversarial Attacks in Reinforcement Learning from Policy Distribution Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) suffers from uncertainties and inaccuracies in the observation signal in realworld applications. Adversarial attack is an effective method for evaluating the robustness of DRL agents. However, existing attack methods targeting individual sampled actions have limited impacts on the overall policy distribution, particularly in continuous action spaces. To address these limitations, we propose the Distribution-Aware Projected Gradient Descent attack (DAPGD). DAPGD uses distribution similarity as the gradient perturbation input to attack the policy network, which leverages the entire policy distribution rather than relying on individual samples. We utilize the Bhattacharyya distance in DAPGD to measure policy similarity, enabling sensitive detection of subtle but critical differences between probability distributions. Our experiment results demonstrate that DAPGD achieves SOTA results compared to the baselines in three robot navigation tasks, achieving an average 22.03% higher reward drop compared to the best baseline.</description>

      <title>Advanced Tutorial: Label-Efficient Two-Sample Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing is a statistical inference approach used to determine whether data supports a specific hypothesis. An important type is the two-sample test, which evaluates whether two sets of data points are from identical distributions. This test is widely used, such as by clinical researchers comparing treatment effectiveness. This tutorial explores two-sample testing in a context where an analyst has many features from two samples, but determining the sample membership (or labels) of these features is costly. In machine learning, a similar scenario is studied in active learning. This tutorial extends active learning concepts to two-sample testing within this \textit{label-costly} setting while maintaining statistical validity and high testing power. Additionally, the tutorial discusses practical applications of these label-efficient two-sample tests.</description>

      <title>AADNet: Exploring EEG Spatiotemporal Information for Fast and Accurate Orientation and Timbre Detection of Auditory Attention Based on A Cue-Masked Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding from electroencephalogram (EEG) could infer to which source the user is attending in noisy environments. Decoding algorithms and experimental paradigm designs are crucial for the development of technology in practical applications. To simulate real-world scenarios, this study proposed a cue-masked auditory attention paradigm to avoid information leakage before the experiment. To obtain high decoding accuracy with low latency, an end-to-end deep learning model, AADNet, was proposed to exploit the spatiotemporal information from the short time window of EEG signals. The results showed that with a 0.5-second EEG window, AADNet achieved an average accuracy of 93.46% and 91.09% in decoding auditory orientation attention (OA) and timbre attention (TA), respectively. It significantly outperformed five previous methods and did not need the knowledge of the original audio source. This work demonstrated that it was possible to detect the orientation and timbre of auditory attention from EEG signals fast and accurately. The results are promising for the real-time multi-property auditory attention decoding, facilitating the application of the neuro-steered hearing aids and other assistive listening devices.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Representation learning via Attention-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Short Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in short text clustering, yet it has an inherent drawback of mistakenly identifying samples from the same category as negatives and then separating them in the feature space (false negative separation), which hinders the generation of superior representations. To generate more discriminative representations for efficient clustering, we propose a novel short text clustering method, called Discriminative Representation learning via \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{AECL}). The \textbf{AECL} consists of two modules which are the pseudo-label generation module and the contrastive learning module. Both modules build a sample-level attention mechanism to capture similarity relationships between samples and aggregate cross-sample features to generate consistent representations. Then, the former module uses the more discriminative consistent representation to produce reliable supervision information for assist clustering, while the latter module explores similarity relationships and consistent representations optimize the construction of positive samples to perform similarity-guided contrastive learning, effectively addressing the false negative separation issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{AECL} outperforms state-of-the-art methods. If the paper is accepted, we will open-source the code.</description>

      <title>Coupled Hierarchical Structure Learning using Tree-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, both data samples and features have underlying hierarchical structures. However, existing methods for learning these latent structures typically focus on either samples or features, ignoring possible coupling between them. In this paper, we introduce a coupled hierarchical structure learning method using tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD). Our method jointly computes TWDs for samples and features, representing their latent hierarchies as trees. We propose an iterative, unsupervised procedure to build these sample and feature trees based on diffusion geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and wavelet filters. We show that this iterative procedure converges and empirically improves the quality of the constructed trees. The method is also computationally efficient and scales well in high-dimensional settings. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCN). We demonstrate that our method outperforms competing approaches in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning on several word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. In addition, integrating our method into HGCN enhances performance in link prediction and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>MHGNet: Multi-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, traffic flow prediction has played a crucial role in the management of intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional forecasting methods often model non-Euclidean low-dimensional traffic data as a simple graph with single-type nodes and edges, failing to capture similar trends among nodes of the same type. To address this limitation, this paper proposes MHGNet, a novel framework for modeling spatiotemporal multi-heterogeneous graphs. Within this framework, the STD Module decouples single-pattern traffic data into multi-pattern traffic data through feature mappings of timestamp embedding matrices and node embedding matrices. Subsequently, the Node Clusterer leverages the Euclidean distance between nodes and different types of limit points to perform clustering with O(N) time complexity. The nodes within each cluster undergo residual subgraph convolution within the spatiotemporal fusion subgraphs generated by the DSTGG Module, followed by processing in the SIE Module for node repositioning and redistribution of weights. To validate the effectiveness of MHGNet, this paper conducts extensive ablation studies and quantitative evaluations on four widely used benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Regression Tasks by Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have gained prominence in domains such as computer vision and natural language processing but remain underutilized for regression tasks involving tabular data. In these cases, traditional machine learning (ML) models often outperform DL models. In this study, we propose and evaluate various data augmentation (DA) techniques to improve the performance of DL models for tabular data regression tasks. We compare the performance gain of Neural Networks by different DA strategies ranging from a naive method of duplicating existing observations and adding noise to a more sophisticated DA strategy that preserves the underlying statistical relationship in the data. Our analysis demonstrates that the advanced DA method significantly improves DL model performance across multiple datasets and regression tasks, resulting in an average performance increase of over 10\% compared to baseline models without augmentation. The efficacy of these DA strategies was rigorously validated across 30 distinct datasets, with multiple iterations and evaluations using three different automated deep learning (AutoDL) frameworks: AutoKeras, H2O, and AutoGluon. This study demonstrates that by leveraging advanced DA techniques, DL models can realize their full potential in regression tasks, thereby contributing to broader adoption and enhanced performance in practical applications.</description>

      <title>SALE-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Ensemble Q-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we build upon the offline reinforcement learning algorithm TD7, which incorporates State-Action Learned Embeddings (SALE) and LAP, and propose a model-free actor-critic algorithm that integrates ensemble Q-networks and a gradient diversity penalty from EDAC. The ensemble Q-networks effectively address the challenge of out-of-distribution actions by introducing penalties that guide the actor network to focus on in-distribution actions. Meanwhile, the gradient diversity penalty encourages diverse Q-value gradients, further suppressing overestimation for out-of-distribution actions. Additionally, our method retains an adjustable behavior cloning (BC) term that directs the actor network toward dataset actions during early training stages, while gradually reducing its influence as the precision of the Q-ensemble improves. These enhancements work synergistically to improve training stability and accuracy. Experimental results on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior convergence speed, stability, and performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Molecule Generation Using Latent Space Graph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating molecular graphs is a challenging task due to their discrete nature and the competitive objectives involved. Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying an appropriate function space for deep neural networks remains a key open question. While shallow neural networks are naturally associated with Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS), deep networks present unique challenges. In this work, we extend RKBS to chain RKBS (cRKBS), a new framework that composes kernels rather than functions, preserving the desirable properties of RKBS. We prove that any deep neural network function is a neural cRKBS function, and conversely, any neural cRKBS function defined on a finite dataset corresponds to a deep neural network. This approach provides a sparse solution to the empirical risk minimization problem, requiring no more than $N$ neurons per layer, where $N$ is the number of data points.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Lightweight Approach to Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in High-Dimensional Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLM Capabilities in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer Neural Architecture Search for Out-of-Distribution Generalization: Benchmark and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ViTs have achieved across machine learning tasks, deploying them in real-world scenarios faces a critical challenge: generalizing under OoD shifts. A crucial research gap exists in understanding how to design ViT architectures, both manually and automatically, for better OoD generalization. To this end, we introduce OoD-ViT-NAS, the first systematic benchmark for ViTs NAS focused on OoD generalization. This benchmark includes 3000 ViT architectures of varying computational budgets evaluated on 8 common OoD datasets. Using this benchmark, we analyze factors contributing to OoD generalization. Our findings reveal key insights. First, ViT architecture designs significantly affect OoD generalization. Second, ID accuracy is often a poor indicator of OoD accuracy, highlighting the risk of optimizing ViT architectures solely for ID performance. Third, we perform the first study of NAS for ViTs OoD robustness, analyzing 9 Training-free NAS methods. We find that existing Training-free NAS methods are largely ineffective in predicting OoD accuracy despite excelling at ID accuracy. Simple proxies like Param or Flop surprisingly outperform complex Training-free NAS methods in predicting OoD accuracy. Finally, we study how ViT architectural attributes impact OoD generalization and discover that increasing embedding dimensions generally enhances performance. Our benchmark shows that ViT architectures exhibit a wide range of OoD accuracy, with up to 11.85% improvement for some OoD shifts. This underscores the importance of studying ViT architecture design for OoD. We believe OoD-ViT-NAS can catalyze further research into how ViT designs influence OoD generalization.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional attention Transformer for state evaluation in real-time strategy games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Situation assessment in Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games is crucial for understanding decision-making in complex adversarial environments. However, existing methods remain limited in processing multi-dimensional feature information and temporal dependencies. Here we propose a tri-dimensional Space-Time-Feature Transformer (TSTF Transformer) architecture, which efficiently models battlefield situations through three independent but cascaded modules: spatial attention, temporal attention, and feature attention. On a dataset comprising 3,150 adversarial experiments, the 8-layer TSTF Transformer demonstrates superior performance: achieving 58.7% accuracy in the early game (~4% progress), significantly outperforming the conventional Timesformer's 41.8%; reaching 97.6% accuracy in the mid-game (~40% progress) while maintaining low performance variation (standard deviation 0.114). Meanwhile, this architecture requires fewer parameters (4.75M) compared to the baseline model (5.54M). Our study not only provides new insights into situation assessment in RTS games but also presents an innovative paradigm for Transformer-based multi-dimensional temporal modeling.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in archaeology have increased significantly in recent years, and these now span all subfields, geographical regions, and time periods. The prevalence and success of these applications have remained largely unexamined, as recent reviews on the use of machine learning in archaeology have only focused only on specific subfields of archaeology. Our review examined an exhaustive corpus of 135 articles published between 1997 and 2022. We observed a significant increase in the number of relevant publications from 2019 onwards. Automatic structure detection and artefact classification were the most represented tasks in the articles reviewed, followed by taphonomy, and archaeological predictive modelling. From the review, clustering and unsupervised methods were underrepresented compared to supervised models. Artificial neural networks and ensemble learning account for two thirds of the total number of models used. However, if machine learning is gaining in popularity it remains subject to misunderstanding. We observed, in some cases, poorly defined requirements and caveats of the machine learning methods used. Furthermore, the goals and the needs of machine learning applications for archaeological purposes are in some cases unclear or poorly expressed. To address this, we proposed a workflow guide for archaeologists to develop coherent and consistent methodologies adapted to their research questions, project scale and data. As in many other areas, machine learning is rapidly becoming an important tool in archaeological research and practice, useful for the analyses of large and multivariate data, although not without limitations. This review highlights the importance of well-defined and well-reported structured methodologies and collaborative practices to maximise the potential of applications of machine learning methods in archaeology.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Generalisation in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is about understanding the impact of invariance and equivariance on generalisation in supervised learning. We use the perspective afforded by an averaging operator to show that for any predictor that is not equivariant, there is an equivariant predictor with strictly lower test risk on all regression problems where the equivariance is correctly specified. This constitutes a rigorous proof that symmetry, in the form of invariance or equivariance, is a useful inductive bias.
  We apply these ideas to equivariance and invariance in random design least squares and kernel ridge regression respectively. This allows us to specify the reduction in expected test risk in more concrete settings and express it in terms of properties of the group, the model and the data.
  Along the way, we give examples and additional results to demonstrate the utility of the averaging operator approach in analysing equivariant predictors. In addition, we adopt an alternative perspective and formalise the common intuition that learning with invariant models reduces to a problem in terms of orbit representatives. The formalism extends naturally to a similar intuition for equivariant models. We conclude by connecting the two perspectives and giving some ideas for future work.</description>

      <title>Truthful mechanisms for linear bandit games with private contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.</description>

      <title>Stochastically Constrained Best Arm Identification with Thompson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the best arm identification in the presence of stochastic constraints, where there is a finite number of arms associated with multiple performance measures. The goal is to identify the arm that optimizes the objective measure subject to constraints on the remaining measures. We will explore the popular idea of Thompson sampling (TS) as a means to solve it. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to extend TS to this problem. We will design a TS-based sampling algorithm, establish its asymptotic optimality in the rate of posterior convergence, and demonstrate its superior performance using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Explainable Reinforcement Learning via Temporal Policy Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the explainability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies from a temporal perspective, focusing on the sequence of future outcomes associated with individual actions. In RL, value functions compress information about rewards collected across multiple trajectories and over an infinite horizon, allowing a compact form of knowledge representation. However, this compression obscures the temporal details inherent in sequential decision-making, presenting a key challenge for interpretability. We present Temporal Policy Decomposition (TPD), a novel explainability approach that explains individual RL actions in terms of their Expected Future Outcome (EFO). These explanations decompose generalized value functions into a sequence of EFOs, one for each time step up to a prediction horizon of interest, revealing insights into when specific outcomes are expected to occur. We leverage fixed-horizon temporal difference learning to devise an off-policy method for learning EFOs for both optimal and suboptimal actions, enabling contrastive explanations consisting of EFOs for different state-action pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that TPD generates accurate explanations that (i) clarify the policy's future strategy and anticipated trajectory for a given action and (ii) improve understanding of the reward composition, facilitating fine-tuning of the reward function to align with human expectations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Public Transportation: San Antonio Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into public transit systems presents a transformative opportunity to enhance urban mobility. This study explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times, and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential. San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered transit systems in other urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the problem of learning a flow or diffusion-based generative model parametrized by a two-layer auto-encoder, trained with online stochastic gradient descent, on a high-dimensional target density with an underlying low-dimensional manifold structure. We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have made it possible to create synthetic datasets that can be as accurate as real-world data for training AI models, powering statistical insights, and fostering collaboration with sensitive datasets while offering strong privacy guarantees. Effectively measuring the empirical privacy of synthetic data is an important step in the process. However, while there is a multitude of new privacy metrics being published every day, there currently is no standardization. In this paper, we review the pros and cons of popular metrics that include simulations of adversarial attacks. We also review current best practices for amending generative models to enhance the privacy of the data they create (e.g. differential privacy).</description>

      <title>RAG-Check: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LLMs) by using external knowledge to guide response generation, reducing hallucinations. However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.</description>

      <title>WAPTS: A Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling Algorithm for High-Dimensional and Sparse Experiment Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming for more effective experiment design, such as in video content advertising where different content options compete for user engagement, these scenarios can be modeled as multi-arm bandit problems. In cases where limited interactions are available due to external factors, such as the cost of conducting experiments, recommenders often face constraints due to the small number of user interactions. In addition, there is a trade-off between selecting the best treatment and the ability to personalize and contextualize based on individual factors. A popular solution to this dilemma is the Contextual Bandit framework. It aims to maximize outcomes while incorporating personalization (contextual) factors, customizing treatments such as a user's profile to individual preferences. Despite their advantages, Contextual Bandit algorithms face challenges like measurement bias and the 'curse of dimensionality.' These issues complicate the management of numerous interventions and often lead to data sparsity through participant segmentation. To address these problems, we introduce the Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm. WAPTS builds on the contextual Thompson Sampling method by using a dynamic weighting parameter. This improves the allocation process for interventions and enables rapid optimization in data-sparse environments. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on different numbers of arms and effect sizes.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Learning in Human Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Sensing, a field that leverages technology to monitor human activities, psycho-physiological states, and interactions with the environment, enhances our understanding of human behavior and drives the development of advanced services that improve overall quality of life. However, its reliance on detailed and often privacy-sensitive data as the basis for its machine learning (ML) models raises significant legal and ethical concerns. The recently proposed ML approach of Federated Learning (FL) promises to alleviate many of these concerns, as it is able to create accurate ML models without sending raw user data to a central server. While FL has demonstrated its usefulness across a variety of areas, such as text prediction and cyber security, its benefits in Human Sensing are under-explored, given the particular challenges in this domain. This survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of the current state-of-the-art studies on FL in Human Sensing, and proposes a taxonomy and an eight-dimensional assessment for FL approaches. Through the eight-dimensional assessment, we then evaluate whether the surveyed studies consider a specific FL-in-Human-Sensing challenge or not. Finally, based on the overall analysis, we discuss open challenges and highlight five research aspects related to FL in Human Sensing that require urgent research attention. Our work provides a comprehensive corpus of FL studies and aims to assist FL practitioners in developing and evaluating solutions that effectively address the real-world complexities of Human Sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Full-Packet Encryption in Mitigating Protocol Detection for Evasive Virtual Private Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-packet encryption is a technique used by modern evasive Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to avoid protocol-based flagging from censorship models by disguising their traffic as random noise on the network. Traditional methods for censoring full-packet-encryption based VPN protocols requires assuming a substantial amount of collateral damage, as other non-VPN network traffic that appears random will be blocked. I tested several machine learning-based classification models against the Aggressive Circumvention of Censorship (ACC) protocol, a fully-encrypted evasive VPN protocol which merges strategies from a wide variety of currently in-use evasive VPN protocols. My testing found that while ACC was able to survive our models when compared to random noise, it was easily detectable with minimal collateral damage using several different machine learning models when within a stream of regular network traffic. While resistant to the current techniques deployed by nation-state censors, the ACC protocol and other evasive protocols are potentially subject to packet-based protocol identification utilizing similar classification models.</description>

      <title>Bridging Auditory Perception and Language Comprehension through MEG-Driven Encoding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.</description>

      <title>Advanced Displacement Magnitude Prediction in Multi-Material Architected Lattice Structure Beams Using Physics Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for predicting deformation in architected lattice structures that combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with finite element analysis. A thorough study was carried out on FCC-based lattice beams utilizing five different materials (Structural Steel, AA6061, AA7075, Ti6Al4V, and Inconel 718) under varied edge loads (1000-10000 N). The PINN model blends data-driven learning with physics-based limitations via a proprietary loss function, resulting in much higher prediction accuracy than linear regression. PINN outperforms linear regression, achieving greater R-square (0.7923 vs 0.5686) and lower error metrics (MSE: 0.00017417 vs 0.00036187). Among the materials examined, AA6061 had the highest displacement sensitivity (0.1014 mm at maximum load), while Inconel718 had better structural stability.</description>

      <title>Toward Inclusive Educational AI: Auditing Frontier LLMs through a Multiplexity Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives. This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within LLMs through the lens of applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multi-layered epistemology that integrates both empirical sciences and normative values. Our analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization, with biases appearing in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address inherent biases and incorporate multiplexity in LLMs, we propose two strategies: \textit{Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, which embed multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, influencing LLM outputs at a foundational level and independent of individual prompts, and \textit{Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs}, where multiple LLM agents, each representing distinct cultural viewpoints, collaboratively generate a balanced, synthesized response. Our findings demonstrate that as mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation, cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25\% at baseline to 98\% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis further shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures,...</description>

      <title>REINFORCE++: A Simple and Efficient Approach for Aligning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical approach for aligning large language models with human preferences, witnessing rapid algorithmic evolution through methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We present REINFORCE++, an enhanced variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm that incorporates key optimization techniques from PPO while eliminating the need for a critic network. REINFORCE++ achieves three primary objectives: (1) simplicity (2) enhanced training stability, and (3) reduced computational overhead. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that REINFORCE++ exhibits superior stability compared to GRPO and achieves greater computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</description>

      <title>ComMer: a Framework for Compressing and Merging User Data for Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at a wide range of tasks, but adapting them to new data, particularly for personalized applications, poses significant challenges due to resource and computational constraints. Existing methods either rely on exposing fresh data to the model through the prompt, which is limited by context size and computationally expensive at inference time, or fine-tuning, which incurs substantial training and update costs. In this paper, we introduce ComMer - Compress and Merge - a novel framework that efficiently personalizes LLMs by compressing users' documents into compact representations, which are then merged and fed into a frozen LLM. We evaluate ComMer on two types of personalization tasks - personalized skill learning, using the tweet paraphrasing dataset and the personalized news headline generation dataset from the LaMP benchmark, and knowledge-intensive, using the PerLTQA dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that in constrained inference budget scenarios ComMer achieves superior quality in skill learning tasks, while highlighting limitations in knowledge-intensive settings due to the loss of detailed information. These results offer insights into trade-offs and potential optimizations in multi-document compression for personalization.</description>

      <title>DenseGNN: universal and scalable deeper graph neural networks for high-performance property prediction in crystals and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials, necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing. We introduce DenseGNN, which employs Dense Connectivity Network (DCN), Hierarchical Node-Edge-Graph Residual Networks (HRN), and Local Structure Order Parameters Embedding (LOPE) to address these challenges. DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy. This advances materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Encrypted Traffic Classification with MH-Net: A Multi-View Heterogeneous Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing significance of network security, the classification of encrypted traffic has emerged as an urgent challenge. Traditional byte-based traffic analysis methods are constrained by the rigid granularity of information and fail to fully exploit the diverse correlations between bytes. To address these limitations, this paper introduces MH-Net, a novel approach for classifying network traffic that leverages multi-view heterogeneous traffic graphs to model the intricate relationships between traffic bytes. The essence of MH-Net lies in aggregating varying numbers of traffic bits into multiple types of traffic units, thereby constructing multi-view traffic graphs with diverse information granularities. By accounting for different types of byte correlations, such as header-payload relationships, MH-Net further endows the traffic graph with heterogeneity, significantly enhancing model performance. Notably, we employ contrastive learning in a multi-task manner to strengthen the robustness of the learned traffic unit representations. Experiments conducted on the ISCX and CIC-IoT datasets for both the packet-level and flow-level traffic classification tasks demonstrate that MH-Net achieves the best overall performance compared to dozens of SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>From Aleatoric to Epistemic: Exploring Uncertainty Quantification Techniques in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a critical aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly in high-risk domains such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and financial technology, where decision-making processes must account for uncertainty. This review explores the evolution of uncertainty quantification techniques in AI, distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and discusses the mathematical foundations and methods used to quantify these uncertainties. We provide an overview of advanced techniques, including probabilistic methods, ensemble learning, sampling-based approaches, and generative models, while also highlighting hybrid approaches that integrate domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, we examine the diverse applications of UQ across various fields, emphasizing its impact on decision-making, predictive accuracy, and system robustness. The review also addresses key challenges such as scalability, efficiency, and integration with explainable AI, and outlines future directions for research in this rapidly developing area. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of UQ's role in enhancing the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of AI systems.</description>

      <title>OpenLKA: an open dataset of lane keeping assist from market autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent car models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network (CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse, challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather, degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM) further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving technology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road geometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset supports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and Chain of Thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Byzantine Robustness in Federated Recommendation from Sparse Aggregation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To preserve user privacy in recommender systems, federated recommendation (FR) based on federated learning (FL) emerges, keeping the personal data on the local client and updating a model collaboratively. Unlike FL, FR has a unique sparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by only partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general FL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received increasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients can send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness of FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g., e-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new accounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse aggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the first effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of sparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks under limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine robustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single item as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective attack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse aggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively prevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients, raising alarms for securing FR systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the current trends in robotics is to employ large language models (LLMs) to provide non-predefined command execution and natural human-robot interaction. It is useful to have an environment map together with its language representation, which can be further utilized by LLMs. Such a comprehensive scene representation enables numerous ways of interaction with the map for autonomously operating robots. In this work, we present an approach that enhances incremental implicit mapping through the integration of vision-language features. Specifically, we (i) propose a decoder optimization technique for implicit language maps which can be used when new objects appear on the scene, and (ii) address the problem of inconsistent vision-language predictions between different viewing positions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LiLMaps and solid improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning: A Review and A Proposed System on Bangladesh's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very crucial part of Bangladeshi people's employment, GDP contribution, and mainly livelihood is agriculture. It plays a vital role in decreasing poverty and ensuring food security. Plant diseases are a serious stumbling block in agricultural production in Bangladesh. At times, humans can't detect the disease from an infected leaf with the naked eye. Using inorganic chemicals or pesticides in plants when it's too late leads in vain most of the time, deposing all the previous labor. The deep-learning technique of leaf-based image classification, which has shown impressive results, can make the work of recognizing and classifying all diseases trouble-less and more precise. In this paper, we've mainly proposed a better model for the detection of leaf diseases. Our proposed paper includes the collection of data on three different kinds of crops: bell peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. For training and testing the proposed CNN model, the plant leaf disease dataset collected from Kaggle is used, which has 17,430 images. The images are labeled with 14 separate classes of damage. The developed CNN model performs efficiently and could successfully detect and classify the tested diseases. The proposed CNN model may have great potency in crop disease management.</description>

      <title>The Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks in Federated Learning with Compression Against Non-omniscient Byzantine Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which offer exceptional energy efficiency for inference, and Federated Learning (FL), which offers privacy-preserving distributed training, is a rising area of interest that highly beneficial towards Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Despite this, research that tackles Byzantine attacks and bandwidth limitation in FL-SNNs, both poses significant threats on model convergence and training times, still remains largely unexplored. Going beyond proposing a solution for both of these problems, in this work we highlight the dual benefits of FL-SNNs, against non-omniscient Byzantine adversaries (ones that restrict attackers access to local clients datasets), and greater communication efficiency, over FL-ANNs. Specifically, we discovered that a simple integration of Top-\k{appa} sparsification into the FL apparatus can help leverage the advantages of the SNN models in both greatly reducing bandwidth usage and significantly boosting the robustness of FL training against non-omniscient Byzantine adversaries. Most notably, we saw a massive improvement of roughly 40% accuracy gain in FL-SNNs training under the lethal MinMax attack</description>

Abstract: Automatic Ship Identification Systems (AIS) play a key role in monitoring maritime traffic, providing the data necessary for analysis and decision-making. The integrity of this data is fundamental to the correctness of infer-ence and decision-making in the context of maritime safety, traffic manage-ment and environmental protection. This paper analyzes the impact of data integrity in large AIS datasets, on classification accuracy. It also presents er-ror detection and correction methods and data verification techniques that can improve the reliability of AIS systems. The results show that improving the integrity of AIS data significantly improves the quality of inference, which has a direct impact on operational efficiency and safety at sea.</description>

      <title>Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Social Support Detection on Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media highlights the need to understand its impact, particularly the role of online social support. This study uses a dataset focused on online social support, which includes binary and multiclass classifications of social support content on social media. The classification of social support is divided into three tasks. The first task focuses on distinguishing between supportive and non-supportive. The second task aims to identify whether the support is directed toward an individual or a group. The third task categorizes the specific type of social support, grouping it into categories such as Nation, LGBTQ, Black people, Women, Religion, and Other (if it does not fit into the previously mentioned categories). To address data imbalances in these tasks, we employed K-means clustering for balancing the dataset and compared the results with the original unbalanced data. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers and zero-shot learning approaches with GPT3, GPT4, and GPT4-o, we predict social support levels in various contexts. The effectiveness of the dataset is evaluated using baseline models across different learning approaches, with transformer-based methods demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, we achieved a 0.4\% increase in the macro F1 score for the second task and a 0.7\% increase for the third task, compared to previous work utilizing traditional machine learning with psycholinguistic and unigram-based TF-IDF values.</description>

      <title>License Plate Images Generation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the evident practical importance of license plate recognition (LPR), corresponding research is limited by the volume of publicly available datasets due to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license plates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and video generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained on a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for detailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the generated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as success rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions include experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP synthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data. Furthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP images, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102. Conducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for the LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained with real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with pseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3% compared to baseline.</description>

Abstract: Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Importance Sampling through Latent Space Exploration in Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Importance sampling is a rare event simulation technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to bias the sampling distribution towards the rare event of interest. By assigning appropriate weights to sampled points, importance sampling allows for more efficient estimation of rare events or tails of distributions. However, importance sampling can fail when the proposal distribution does not effectively cover the target distribution. In this work, we propose a method for more efficient sampling by updating the proposal distribution in the latent space of a normalizing flow. Normalizing flows learn an invertible mapping from a target distribution to a simpler latent distribution. The latent space can be more easily explored during the search for a proposal distribution, and samples from the proposal distribution are recovered in the space of the target distribution via the invertible mapping. We empirically validate our methodology on simulated robotics applications such as autonomous racing and aircraft ground collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Benjamini Hochberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is widely used to control the false detection rate (FDR) in multiple testing. Applications of this control abound in drug discovery, forensics, anomaly detection, and, in particular, machine learning, ranging from nonparametric outlier detection to out-of-distribution detection and one-class classification methods. Considering this control could be relied upon in critical safety/security contexts, we investigate its adversarial robustness. More precisely, we study under what conditions BH does and does not exhibit adversarial robustness, we present a class of simple and easily implementable adversarial test-perturbation algorithms, and we perform computational experiments. With our algorithms, we demonstrate that there are conditions under which BH's control can be significantly broken with relatively few (even just one) test score perturbation(s), and provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the expected adversarial-adjustment to FDR. Our technical analysis involves a combinatorial reframing of the BH procedure as a ``balls into bins'' process, and drawing a connection to generalized ballot problems to facilitate an information-theoretic approach for deriving non-asymptotic lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preference Enabled Graph Embedding Generation under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph embedding generation techniques aim to learn low-dimensional vectors for each node in a graph and have recently gained increasing research attention. Publishing low-dimensional node vectors enables various graph analysis tasks, such as structural equivalence and link prediction. Yet, improper publication opens a backdoor to malicious attackers, who can infer sensitive information of individuals from the low-dimensional node vectors. Existing methods tackle this issue by developing deep graph learning models with differential privacy (DP). However, they often suffer from large noise injections and cannot provide structural preferences consistent with mining objectives. Recently, skip-gram based graph embedding generation techniques are widely used due to their ability to extract customizable structures. Based on skip-gram, we present SE-PrivGEmb, a structure-preference enabled graph embedding generation under DP. For arbitrary structure preferences, we design a unified noise tolerance mechanism via perturbing non-zero vectors. This mechanism mitigates utility degradation caused by high sensitivity. By carefully designing negative sampling probabilities in skip-gram, we theoretically demonstrate that skip-gram can preserve arbitrary proximities, which quantify structural features in graphs. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under structural equivalence and link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Reading with Intent -- Neutralizing Intent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Queries to large language models (LLMs) can be divided into two parts: the instruction/question and the accompanying context. The context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in most benchmarks comes from Wikipedia or Wikipedia-like texts which are written in a neutral and factual tone. However, when RAG systems retrieve internet-based content, they encounter text with diverse tones and linguistic styles, introducing challenges for downstream tasks. The Reading with Intent task addresses this issue by evaluating how varying tones in context passages affect model performance. Building on prior work that focused on sarcasm, we extend this paradigm by constructing a dataset where context passages are transformed to $11$ distinct emotions using a better synthetic data generation approach. Using this dataset, we train an emotion translation model to systematically adapt passages to specified emotional tones. The human evaluation shows that the LLM fine-tuned to become the emotion-translator benefited from the synthetically generated data. Finally, the emotion-translator is used in the Reading with Intent task to transform the passages to a neutral tone. By neutralizing the passages, it mitigates the challenges posed by sarcastic passages and improves overall results on this task by about $3\%$.</description>

      <title>Textualize Visual Prompt for Image Editing via Diffusion Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual prompt, a pair of before-and-after edited images, can convey indescribable imagery transformations and prosper in image editing. However, current visual prompt methods rely on a pretrained text-guided image-to-image generative model that requires a triplet of text, before, and after images for retraining over a text-to-image model. Such crafting triplets and retraining processes limit the scalability and generalization of editing. In this paper, we present a framework based on any single text-to-image model without reliance on the explicit image-to-image model thus enhancing the generalizability and scalability. Specifically, by leveraging the probability-flow ordinary equation, we construct a diffusion bridge to transfer the distribution between before-and-after images under the text guidance. By optimizing the text via the bridge, the framework adaptively textualizes the editing transformation conveyed by visual prompts into text embeddings without other models. Meanwhile, we introduce differential attention control during text optimization, which disentangles the text embedding from the invariance of the before-and-after images and makes it solely capture the delicate transformation and generalize to edit various images. Experiments on real images validate competitive results on the generalization, contextual coherence, and high fidelity for delicate editing with just one image pair as the visual prompt.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoff and Training Efficiency in Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced image representation learning, yet efficiency challenges persist, particularly with adversarial training. Many SSL methods require extensive epochs to achieve convergence, a demand further amplified in adversarial settings. To address this inefficiency, we revisit the robust EMP-SSL framework, emphasizing the importance of increasing the number of crops per image to accelerate learning. Unlike traditional contrastive learning, robust EMP-SSL leverages multi-crop sampling, integrates an invariance term and regularization, and reduces training epochs, enhancing time efficiency. Evaluated with both standard linear classifiers and multi-patch embedding aggregation, robust EMP-SSL provides new insights into SSL evaluation strategies.
  Our results show that robust crop-based EMP-SSL not only accelerates convergence but also achieves a superior balance between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, outperforming multi-crop embedding aggregation. Additionally, we extend this approach with free adversarial training in Multi-Crop SSL, introducing the Cost-Free Adversarial Multi-Crop Self-Supervised Learning (CF-AMC-SSL) method. CF-AMC-SSL demonstrates the effectiveness of free adversarial training in reducing training time while simultaneously improving clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. These findings underscore the potential of CF-AMC-SSL for practical SSL applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/softsys4ai/CF-AMC-SSL.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Deep-Unfolded Combinatorial Optimization Solver with Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has attracted research interest as a sampler and combinatorial optimization problem (COP) solver. A recently proposed sampling-based solver for QA significantly reduces the required number of qubits, being capable of large COPs. In relation to this, a trainable sampling-based COP solver has been proposed that optimizes its internal parameters from a dataset by using a deep learning technique called deep unfolding. Although learning the internal parameters accelerates the convergence speed, the sampler in the trainable solver is restricted to using a classical sampler owing to the training cost. In this study, to utilize QA in the trainable solver, we propose classical-quantum transfer learning, where parameters are trained classically, and the trained parameters are used in the solver with QA. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the trainable quantum COP solver using classical-quantum transfer learning improves convergence speed and execution time over the original solver.</description>

      <title>Vocal Tract Length Warped Features for Spoken Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose several methods that incorporate vocal tract length (VTL) warped features for spoken keyword spotting (KWS). The first method, VTL-independent KWS, involves training a single deep neural network (DNN) that utilizes VTL features with various warping factors. During training, a specific VTL feature is randomly selected per epoch, allowing the exploration of VTL variations. During testing, the VTL features with different warping factors of a test utterance are scored against the DNN and combined with equal weight. In the second method scores the conventional features of a test utterance (without VTL warping) against the DNN. The third method, VTL-concatenation KWS, concatenates VTL warped features to form high-dimensional features for KWS. Evaluations carried out on the English Google Command dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods improve the accuracy of KWS.</description>

      <title>FgC2F-UDiff: Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model for Multi-modality Missing MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, missing modalities are commonly observed due to limitations in scan time, scan corruption, artifacts, motion, and contrast agent intolerance. Synthesis of missing MRI has been a means to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice and research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor generalization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model, the Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff), designed for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine Unified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of diffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into two stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images. Secondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses appropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a unified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid Mechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion model and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed FgC2F-UDiff model achieves superior performance on two datasets, validated through a comprehensive assessment that includes both qualitative observations and quantitative metrics, such as PSNR SSIM, LPIPS, and FID.</description>

      <title>KG-TRICK: Unifying Textual and Relational Information Completion of Knowledge for Multilingual Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual knowledge graphs (KGs) provide high-quality relational and textual information for various NLP applications, but they are often incomplete, especially in non-English languages. Previous research has shown that combining information from KGs in different languages aids either Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), the task of predicting missing relations between entities, or Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE), the task of predicting missing textual information for entities. Although previous efforts have considered KGC and KGE as independent tasks, we hypothesize that they are interdependent and mutually beneficial. To this end, we introduce KG-TRICK, a novel sequence-to-sequence framework that unifies the tasks of textual and relational information completion for multilingual KGs. KG-TRICK demonstrates that: i) it is possible to unify the tasks of KGC and KGE into a single framework, and ii) combining textual information from multiple languages is beneficial to improve the completeness of a KG. As part of our contributions, we also introduce WikiKGE10++, the largest manually-curated benchmark for textual information completion of KGs, which features over 25,000 entities across 10 diverse languages.</description>

Abstract: Physical AI needs to be trained digitally first. It needs a digital twin of itself, the policy model, and a digital twin of the world, the world model. In this paper, we present the Cosmos World Foundation Model Platform to help developers build customized world models for their Physical AI setups. We position a world foundation model as a general-purpose world model that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications. Our platform covers a video curation pipeline, pre-trained world foundation models, examples of post-training of pre-trained world foundation models, and video tokenizers. To help Physical AI builders solve the most critical problems of our society, we make our platform open-source and our models open-weight with permissive licenses available via https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos.</description>

      <title>STContext: A Multifaceted Dataset for Developing Context-aware Spatio-temporal Crowd Mobility Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In smart cities, context-aware spatio-temporal crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models leverage contextual features (e.g., weather) to identify unusual crowd mobility patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research. The STContext is open-sourced at https://github.com/Liyue-Chen/STContext.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning of MPC with Neural Networks: Error Guarantees and Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for bounding the approximation error in imitation model predictive controllers utilizing neural networks. Leveraging the Lipschitz properties of these neural networks, we derive a bound that guides dataset design to ensure the approximation error remains at chosen limits. We discuss how this method can be used to design a stable neural network controller with performance guarantees employing existing robust model predictive control approaches for data generation. Additionally, we introduce a training adjustment, which is based on the sensitivities of the optimization problem and reduces dataset density requirements based on the derived bounds. We verify that the proposed augmentation results in improvements to the network's predictive capabilities and a reduction of the Lipschitz constant. Moreover, on a simulated inverted pendulum problem, we show that the approach results in a closer match of the closed-loop behavior between the imitation and the original model predictive controller.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble chemotaxis using reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial cells use run-and-tumble motion to climb up attractant concentration gradient in their environment. By extending the uphill runs and shortening the downhill runs the cells migrate towards the higher attractant zones. Motivated by this, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm where an agent moves in one dimension in the presence of an attractant gradient. The agent can perform two actions: either persistent motion in the same direction or reversal of direction. We assign costs for these actions based on the recent history of the agent's trajectory. We ask the question: which RL strategy works best in different types of attractant environment. We quantify efficiency of the RL strategy by the ability of the agent (a) to localize in the favorable zones after large times, and (b) to learn about its complete environment. Depending on the attractant profile and the initial condition, we find an optimum balance is needed between exploration and exploitation to ensure the most efficient performance.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Speech Segmentation: A General Approach Using Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised approach for Speech Segmentation, which builds on previously researched approaches, e.g., Speaker Diarization, while being applicable to an inclusive set of acoustic-semantic distinctions, paving a path towards a general Unsupervised Speech Segmentation approach. Unlike traditional speech and audio segmentation, which mainly focuses on spectral changes in the input signal, e.g., phone segmentation, our approach tries to segment the spoken utterance into chunks with differing acoustic-semantic styles, focusing on acoustic-semantic information that does not translate well into text, e.g., emotion or speaker. While most Speech Segmentation tasks only handle one style change, e.g., emotion diarization, our approach tries to handle multiple acoustic-semantic style changes. Leveraging recent advances in Speech Language Models (SLMs), we propose a simple unsupervised method to segment a given speech utterance. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by considering several setups. Results suggest that the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines on boundary detection, segment purity, and over-segmentation.

      <description>arXiv:2501.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive construction approaches generate solutions to vehicle routing problems in a step-by-step fashion, leading to high-quality solutions that are nearing the performance achieved by handcrafted, operations research techniques. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigm of sequential solution construction and introduce an iterative search framework where solutions are instead deconstructed by a neural policy. Throughout the search, the neural policy collaborates with a simple greedy insertion algorithm to rebuild the deconstructed solutions. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art operations research methods across three challenging vehicle routing problems of various problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Neurocognitive Disorders through Analyses of Topic Evolution and Cross-modal Consistency in Visual-Stimulated Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Speech analysis offers a non-intrusive and scalable screening method, particularly through narrative tasks in neuropsychological assessment tools. Traditional narrative analysis often focuses on local indicators in microstructure, such as word usage and syntax. While these features provide insights into language production abilities, they often fail to capture global narrative patterns, or microstructures. Macrostructures include coherence, thematic organization, and logical progressions, reflecting essential cognitive skills potentially critical for recognizing NCDs. Addressing this gap, we propose to investigate specific cognitive and linguistic challenges by analyzing topical shifts, temporal dynamics, and the coherence of narratives over time, aiming to reveal cognitive deficits by identifying narrative impairments, and exploring their impact on communication and cognition. The investigation is based on the CU-MARVEL Rabbit Story corpus, which comprises recordings of a story-telling task from 758 older adults. We developed two approaches: the Dynamic Topic Models (DTM)-based temporal analysis to examine the evolution of topics over time, and the Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to evaluate the coherence between spoken narratives and visual stimuli. DTM-based approach validated the effectiveness of dynamic topic consistency as a macrostructural metric (F1=0.61, AUC=0.78). The TITAN approach achieved the highest performance (F1=0.72, AUC=0.81), surpassing established microstructural and macrostructural feature sets. Cross-comparison and regression tasks further demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed dynamic macrostructural modeling approaches for NCD detection.</description>

      <title>Multi-label Cross-lingual automatic music genre classification from lyrics with Sentence BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music genres are shaped by both the stylistic features of songs and the cultural preferences of artists' audiences. Automatic classification of music genres using lyrics can be useful in several applications such as recommendation systems, playlist creation, and library organization. We present a multi-label, cross-lingual genre classification system based on multilingual sentence embeddings generated by sBERT. Using a bilingual Portuguese-English dataset with eight overlapping genres, we demonstrate the system's ability to train on lyrics in one language and predict genres in another. Our approach outperforms the baseline approach of translating lyrics and using a bag-of-words representation, improving the genrewise average F1-Score from 0.35 to 0.69. The classifier uses a one-vs-all architecture, enabling it to assign multiple genre labels to a single lyric. Experimental results reveal that dataset centralization notably improves cross-lingual performance. This approach offers a scalable solution for genre classification across underrepresented languages and cultural domains, advancing the capabilities of music information retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Class-Balance Bias in Regularized Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of binary features directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data selection is critical for enhancing the performance of language models, particularly when aligning training datasets with a desired target distribution. This study explores the effects of different data selection methods and feature types on model performance. We evaluate whether selecting data subsets can influence downstream tasks, whether n-gram features improve alignment with target distributions, and whether embedding-based neural features provide complementary benefits. Through comparative experiments using baseline random selection methods and distribution aligned approaches, we provide insights into the interplay between data selection strategies and model training efficacy.

      <title>BERTopic for Topic Modeling of Hindi Short Texts: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As short text data in native languages like Hindi increasingly appear in modern media, robust methods for topic modeling on such data have gained importance. This study investigates the performance of BERTopic in modeling Hindi short texts, an area that has been under-explored in existing research. Using contextual embeddings, BERTopic can capture semantic relationships in data, making it potentially more effective than traditional models, especially for short and diverse texts. We evaluate BERTopic using 6 different document embedding models and compare its performance against 8 established topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Additive Regularization of Topic Models (ARTM), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), Embedded Topic Model (ETM), Combined Topic Model (CTM), and Top2Vec. The models are assessed using coherence scores across a range of topic counts. Our results reveal that BERTopic consistently outperforms other models in capturing coherent topics from short Hindi texts.</description>

      <title>Leveraging time and parameters for nonlinear model reduction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider model order reduction (MOR) methods for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-widths as, e.g., certain wave-like or transport-dominated problems. To overcome this Kolmogorov barrier within MOR, nonlinear projections are used, which are often realized numerically using autoencoders. These autoencoders generally consist of a nonlinear encoder and a nonlinear decoder and involve costly training of the hyperparameters to obtain a good approximation quality of the reduced system. To facilitate the training process, we show that extending the to-be-reduced system and its corresponding training data makes it possible to replace the nonlinear encoder with a linear encoder without sacrificing accuracy, thus roughly halving the number of hyperparameters to be trained.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</description>

      <title>SELMA3D challenge: Self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments in tissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissues with cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale data analysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers to rapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diverse biological samples. Segmentation, a crucial preliminary step in the analysis process, can be automated using domain-specific deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, these models exhibit high sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to data outside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizable models, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference. SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice and human brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and 315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and final testing. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, including vessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases of the challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper. Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstrate that self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation model performance and generalization. We will continue to support and extend SELMA3D as an inaugural MICCAI challenge focused on self-supervised learning for 3D microscopy image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Neural DNF-MT: A Neuro-symbolic Approach for Learning Interpretable and Editable Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.</description>

      <title>mFabric: An Efficient and Scalable Fabric for Mixture-of-Experts Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models outperform conventional models by selectively activating different subnets, named \emph{experts}, on a per-token basis. This gated computation generates dynamic communications that cannot be determined beforehand, challenging the existing GPU interconnects that remain \emph{static} during the distributed training process. In this paper, we advocate for a first-of-its-kind system, called mFabric, that unlocks topology reconfiguration \emph{during} distributed MoE training. Towards this vision, we first perform a production measurement study and show that the MoE dynamic communication pattern has \emph{strong locality}, alleviating the requirement of global reconfiguration. Based on this, we design and implement a \emph{regionally reconfigurable high-bandwidth domain} on top of existing electrical interconnects using optical circuit switching (OCS), achieving scalability while maintaining rapid adaptability. We have built a fully functional mFabric prototype with commodity hardware and a customized collective communication runtime that trains state-of-the-art MoE models with \emph{in-training} topology reconfiguration across 32 A100 GPUs. Large-scale packet-level simulations show that mFabric delivers comparable performance as the non-blocking fat-tree fabric while boosting the training cost efficiency (e.g., performance per dollar) of four representative MoE models by 1.2$\times$--1.5$\times$ and 1.9$\times$--2.3$\times$ at 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps link bandwidths, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are complex and lack effective treatment due to their poorly understood mechanism. The increasingly used data analysis from Single nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq) allows to explore transcriptomic events at a single cell level, yet face challenges in interpreting the mechanisms underlying a disease. On the other hand, Neural Network (NN) models can handle complex data to offer insights but can be seen as black boxes with poor interpretability. In this context, explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a solution that could help to understand disease-associated mechanisms when combined with efficient NN models. However, limited research explores XAI in single-cell data. In this work, we implement a method for identifying disease-related genes and the mechanistic explanation of disease progression based on NN model combined with SHAP. We analyze available Huntington's disease (HD) data to identify both HD-altered genes and mechanisms by adding Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing two methods, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and NN combined with SHAP approach. Our results show that DGE and SHAP approaches offer both common and differential sets of altered genes and pathways, reinforcing the usefulness of XAI methods for a broader perspective of disease.</description>

      <title>From Newswire to Nexus: Using text-based actor embeddings and transformer networks to forecast conflict dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias, separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>LiMoE: Mixture of LiDAR Representation Learners from Automotive Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR data pretraining offers a promising approach to leveraging large-scale, readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existing methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work, we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points. Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11 large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach delivers significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both linear probing and fine-tuning tasks for both LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on eleven large-scale multi-modal datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating the adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transferable Adversarial Examples with Bayes Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to black-box adversarial attacks is one of the most heated topics in trustworthy AI. In such attacks, the attackers operate without any insider knowledge of the model, making the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples critical. Despite the potential for adversarial examples to be effective across various models, it has been observed that adversarial examples that are specifically crafted for a specific model often exhibit poor transferability. In this paper, we explore the transferability of adversarial examples via the lens of Bayesian approach. Specifically, we leverage Bayesian approach to probe the transferability and then study what constitutes a transferability-promoting prior. Following this, we design two concrete transferability-promoting priors, along with an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for instances sampled from these priors. Employing these techniques, we present BayAtk. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant effectiveness of BayAtk in crafting more transferable adversarial examples against both undefended and defended black-box models compared to existing state-of-the-art attacks.</description>

      <title>On Penalty-based Bilevel Gradient Descent Method</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in emerging machine learning and signal processing problems such as hyper-parameter optimization, image reconstruction, meta-learning, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel optimization problems are traditionally known to be difficult to solve. Recent progress on bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on bilevel optimization problems through the lens of the implicit-gradient method, where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle a challenging class of bilevel problems through the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty reformulation recovers the (local) solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent (PBGD) algorithm and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem with lower-level constraints yet without lower-level strong convexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the efficiency of the proposed PBGD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Towards Mitigating Architecture Overfitting on Distilled Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dataset distillation methods have demonstrated remarkable performance for neural networks trained with very limited training data. However, a significant challenge arises in the form of \textit{architecture overfitting}: the distilled training dataset synthesized by a specific network architecture (i.e., training network) generates poor performance when trained by other network architectures (i.e., test networks), especially when the test networks have a larger capacity than the training network. This paper introduces a series of approaches to mitigate this issue. Among them, DropPath renders the large model to be an implicit ensemble of its sub-networks, and knowledge distillation ensures each sub-network acts similarly to the small but well-performing teacher network. These methods, characterized by their smoothing effects, significantly mitigate architecture overfitting. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our methods. Particularly, across various scenarios involving different tasks and different sizes of distilled data, our approaches significantly mitigate architecture overfitting. Furthermore, our approaches achieve comparable or even superior performance when the test network is larger than the training network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for privacy-preserving machine learning has spurred interest in federated unlearning, which enables the selective removal of data from models trained in federated systems. However, developing federated unlearning methods presents challenges, particularly in balancing three often conflicting objectives: privacy, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of existing federated unlearning approaches, examining their algorithmic efficiency, impact on model accuracy, and effectiveness in preserving privacy. We discuss key trade-offs among these dimensions and highlight their implications for practical applications across various domains. Additionally, we propose the OpenFederatedUnlearning framework, a unified benchmark for evaluating federated unlearning methods, incorporating classic baselines and diverse performance metrics. Our findings aim to guide practitioners in navigating the complex interplay of these objectives, offering insights to achieve effective and efficient federated unlearning. Finally, we outline directions for future research to further advance the state of federated unlearning techniques.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Improvements to Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization and has found countless successful applications, but its performance is often exceeded by that of more recent methods. Notably, EI and its variants, including for the parallel and multi-objective settings, are challenging to optimize because their acquisition values vanish numerically in many regions. This difficulty generally increases as the number of observations, dimensionality of the search space, or the number of constraints grow, resulting in performance that is inconsistent across the literature and most often sub-optimal. Herein, we propose LogEI, a new family of acquisition functions whose members either have identical or approximately equal optima as their canonical counterparts, but are substantially easier to optimize numerically. We demonstrate that numerical pathologies manifest themselves in "classic" analytic EI, Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), as well as their constrained, noisy, and parallel variants, and propose corresponding reformulations that remedy these pathologies. Our empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions, highlighting the understated role of numerical optimization in the literature.</description>

      <title>Can Out-of-Domain data help to Learn Domain-Specific Prompts for Multimodal Misinformation Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spread of fake news using out-of-context images and captions has become widespread in this era of information overload. Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with a Reject Option</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world applications, one often encounters ambiguously labeled data, where different annotators assign conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent nearest-neighbor-based partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions. When evaluated without the reject option, our nearest-neighbor-based approach also achieves competitive prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Learning and Decision-Making: Breaking the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Barrier in Online Resource Allocation with First-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes several important facts about online linear programming, which unveils the challenge for first-order-method-based online algorithms to achieve beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. To address the challenge, we introduce a new algorithmic framework that decouples learning from decision-making. For the first time, we show that first-order methods can attain regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ with this new framework.</description>

      <title>FIDLAR: Forecast-Informed Deep Learning Architecture for Flood Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In coastal river systems, frequent floods, often occurring during major storms or king tides, pose a severe threat to lives and property. However, these floods can be mitigated or even prevented by strategically releasing water before extreme weather events with hydraulic structures such as dams, gates, pumps, and reservoirs. A standard approach used by local water management agencies is the "rule-based" method, which specifies predetermined pre-releases of water based on historical and time-tested human experience, but which tends to result in excess or inadequate water release. The model predictive control (MPC), a physics-based model for prediction, is an alternative approach, albeit involving computationally intensive calculations. In this paper, we propose a Forecast Informed Deep Learning Architecture, FIDLAR, to achieve rapid and optimal flood management with precise water pre-releases. FIDLAR seamlessly integrates two neural network modules: one called the Flood Manager, which is responsible for generating water pre-release schedules, and another called the Flood Evaluator, which assesses these generated schedules. The Evaluator module is pre-trained separately, and its gradient-based feedback is used to train the Manager model, ensuring optimal water pre-releases. We have conducted experiments using FIDLAR with data from a flood-prone coastal area in South Florida, particularly susceptible to frequent storms. Results show that FIDLAR is several orders of magnitude faster than currently used physics-based approaches while outperforming baseline methods with improved water pre-release schedules.</description>

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders for multimodal data hold promise for many tasks in data analysis, such as representation learning, conditional generation, and imputation. Current architectures either share the encoder output, decoder input, or both across modalities to learn a shared representation. Such architectures impose hard constraints on the model. In this work, we show that a better latent representation can be obtained by replacing these hard constraints with a soft constraint. We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior, softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior. This approach results in a superior latent representation and allows each encoding to preserve information better from its uncompressed original features. In extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and two challenging real-world datasets, we show improved learned latent representations and imputation of missing data modalities compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Ensemble learning for predictive uncertainty estimation with application to the correction of satellite precipitation products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictions in the form of probability distributions are crucial for effective decision-making. Quantile regression enables such predictions within spatial prediction settings that aim to create improved precipitation datasets by merging remote sensing and gauge data. However, ensemble learning of quantile regression algorithms remains unexplored in this context and, at the same time, it has not been substantially developed so far in the broader machine learning research landscape. Here, we introduce nine quantile-based ensemble learners and address the afore-mentioned gap in precipitation dataset creation by presenting the first application of these learners to large precipitation datasets. We employed a novel feature engineering strategy, reducing predictors to distance-weighted satellite precipitation at relevant locations, combined with location elevation. Our ensemble learners include six ensemble learning and three simple methods (mean, median, best combiner), combining six individual algorithms: quantile regression (QR), quantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM), and quantile regression neural networks (QRNN). These algorithms serve as both base learners and combiners within different ensemble learning methods. We evaluated performance against a reference method (QR) using quantile scoring functions in a large dataset comprising 15 years of monthly gauge-measured and satellite precipitation in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Ensemble learning with QR and QRNN yielded the best results across quantile levels ranging from 0.025 to 0.975, outperforming the reference method by 3.91% to 8.95%. This demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning to improve probabilistic spatial predictions.</description>

      <title>Stability and Generalization in Free Adversarial Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While adversarial training methods have significantly improved the robustness of deep neural networks against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations, the generalization gap between their performance on training and test data is considerably greater than that of standard empirical risk minimization. Recent studies have aimed to connect the generalization properties of adversarially trained classifiers to the min-max optimization algorithm used in their training. In this work, we analyze the interconnections between generalization and optimization in adversarial training using the algorithmic stability framework. Specifically, our goal is to compare the generalization gap of neural networks trained using the vanilla adversarial training method, which fully optimizes perturbations at every iteration, with the free adversarial training method, which simultaneously optimizes norm-bounded perturbations and classifier parameters. We prove bounds on the generalization error of these methods, indicating that the free adversarial training method may exhibit a lower generalization gap between training and test samples due to its simultaneous min-max optimization of classifier weights and perturbation variables. We conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the train-to-test generalization gap in vanilla and free adversarial training methods. Our empirical findings also suggest that the free adversarial training method could lead to a smaller generalization gap over a similar number of training iterations.

      <title>Initialization is Critical to Whether Transformers Fit Composite Functions by Reasoning or Memorizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on compositional problems remains a topic of debate. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms of how transformers behave on unseen compositional tasks. We discover that the parameter initialization scale plays a critical role in determining whether the model learns inferential (reasoning-based) solutions, which capture the underlying compositional primitives, or symmetric (memory-based) solutions, which simply memorize mappings without understanding the compositional structure. By analyzing the information flow and vector representations within the model, we reveal the distinct mechanisms underlying these solution types. We further find that inferential (reasoning-based) solutions exhibit low complexity bias, which we hypothesize is a key factor enabling them to learn individual mappings for single anchors. We validate our conclusions on various real-world datasets. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of initialization scale in tuning the reasoning and memorizing ability and we propose the initialization rate $\gamma$ to be a convenient tunable hyper-parameter in common deep learning frameworks, where $1/d_{\mathrm{in}}^\gamma$ is the standard deviation of parameters of the layer with $d_{\mathrm{in}}$ input neurons.</description>

      <title>Highway Graph to Accelerate Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often struggle with low training efficiency. A common approach to address this challenge is integrating model-based planning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or Value Iteration (VI), into the environmental model. However, VI requires iterating over a large tensor which updates the value of the preceding state based on the succeeding state through value propagation, resulting in computationally intensive operations. To enhance the RL training efficiency, we propose improving the efficiency of the value learning process. In deterministic environments with discrete state and action spaces, we observe that on the sampled empirical state-transition graph, a non-branching sequence of transitions-termed a highway-can take the agent to another state without deviation through intermediate states. On these non-branching highways, the value-updating process can be streamlined into a single-step operation, eliminating the need for step-by-step updates. Building on this observation, we introduce the highway graph to model state transitions. The highway graph compresses the transition model into a compact representation, where edges can encapsulate multiple state transitions, enabling value propagation across multiple time steps in a single iteration. By integrating the highway graph into RL, the training process is significantly accelerated, particularly in the early stages of training. Experiments across four categories of environments demonstrate that our method learns significantly faster than established and state-of-the-art RL algorithms (often by a factor of 10 to 150) while maintaining equal or superior expected returns. Furthermore, a deep neural network-based agent trained using the highway graph exhibits improved generalization capabilities and reduced storage costs.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</description>

      <title>On the Mode-Seeking Properties of Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Langevin Dynamics framework, which aims to generate samples from the score function of a probability distribution, is widely used for analyzing and interpreting score-based generative modeling. While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose \emph{Chained Langevin Dynamics}, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

      <title>xMIL: Insightful Explanations for Multiple Instance Learning in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is an effective and widely used approach for weakly supervised machine learning. In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

      <title>Graph Neural Backdoor: Fundamentals, Methodologies, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced various downstream graph-relevant tasks, encompassing recommender systems, molecular structure prediction, social media analysis, etc. Despite the boosts of GNN, recent research has empirically demonstrated its potential vulnerability to backdoor attacks, wherein adversaries employ triggers to poison input samples, inducing GNN to adversary-premeditated malicious outputs. This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.</description>

      <title>DistPred: A Distribution-Free Probabilistic Inference Method for Regression and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional regression and prediction tasks often only provide deterministic point estimates. To estimate the distribution or uncertainty of the response variable, traditional methods either assume that the posterior distribution of samples follows a Gaussian process or require thousands of forward passes for sample generation. We propose a novel approach called DistPred for regression and forecasting tasks, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods while remaining simple and powerful. Specifically, we transform proper scoring rules that measure the discrepancy between the predicted distribution and the target distribution into a differentiable discrete form and use it as a loss function to train the model end-to-end. This allows the model to sample numerous samples in a single forward pass to estimate the potential distribution of the response variable. We have compared our method with several existing approaches on multiple datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our method significantly improves computational efficiency. For example, compared to state-of-the-art models, DistPred has a 180x faster inference speed Experimental results can be reproduced through https://github.com/Anoise/DistPred.</description>

      <title>Standardness Clouds Meaning: A Position Regarding the Informed Usage of Standard Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard datasets are frequently used to train and evaluate Machine Learning models. However, the assumed standardness of these datasets leads to a lack of in-depth discussion on how their labels match the derived categories for the respective use case, which we demonstrate by reviewing recent literature that employs standard datasets. We find that the standardness of the datasets seems to cloud their actual coherency and applicability, thus impeding the trust in Machine Learning models trained on these datasets. Therefore, we argue against the uncritical use of standard datasets and advocate for their critical examination instead. For this, we suggest to use Grounded Theory in combination with Hypotheses Testing through Visualization as methods to evaluate the match between use case, derived categories, and labels. We exemplify this approach by applying it to the 20 Newsgroups dataset and the MNIST dataset, both considered standard datasets in their respective domain. The results show that the labels of the 20 Newsgroups dataset are imprecise, which implies that neither a Machine Learning model can learn a meaningful abstraction of derived categories nor one can draw conclusions from achieving high accuracy on this dataset. For the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that the labels can be confirmed to be defined well. We conclude that also for datasets that are considered to be standard, quality and suitability have to be assessed in order to learn meaningful abstractions and, thus, improve trust in Machine Learning models.</description>

      <title>BoRA: Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption for Multi-Task Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for graph representation learning in various domains, such as social media and healthcare. However, they often suffer from fairness issues due to inherent biases in node attributes and graph structure, leading to unfair predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN framework, DAB-GNN, that Disentangles, Amplifies, and deBiases attribute, structure, and potential biases in the GNN mechanism. DAB-GNN employs a disentanglement and amplification module that isolates and amplifies each type of bias through specialized disentanglers, followed by a debiasing module that minimizes the distance between subgroup distributions. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that DAB-GNN significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art competitors in terms of achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and fairness.

      <title>Localize-and-Stitch: Efficient Model Merging via Sparse Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging offers an effective strategy to combine the strengths of multiple finetuned models into a unified model that preserves the specialized capabilities of each. Existing methods merge models in a global manner, performing arithmetic operations across all model parameters. However, such global merging often leads to task interference, degrading the performance of the merged model. In this work, we introduce Localize-and-Stitch, a novel approach that merges models in a localized way. Our algorithm works in two steps: i) Localization: identify tiny ($1\%$ of the total parameters) localized regions in the finetuned models containing essential skills for the downstream tasks, and ii) Stitching: reintegrate only these essential regions back into the pretrained model for task synergy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively locates sparse regions responsible for finetuned performance, and the localized regions could be treated as compact and interpretable representations of the finetuned models (tasks). Empirically, we evaluate our method on various vision and language benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing model merging methods under different data availability scenarios. Beyond strong empirical performance, our algorithm also facilitates model compression and preserves pretrained knowledge, enabling flexible and continual skill composition from multiple finetuned models with minimal storage and computational overhead.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08861v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there have not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</description>

      <title>GraphLoRA: Structure-Aware Contrastive Low-Rank Adaptation for Cross-Graph Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in handling a range of graph analytical tasks across various domains, such as e-commerce and social networks. Despite their versatility, GNNs face significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains. Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphLoRA against fourteen baselines by tuning only 20% of parameters, even across disparate graph domains. The code is available at https://github.com/AllminerLab/GraphLoRA.</description>

      <title>Fast and Sample Efficient Multi-Task Representation Learning in Stochastic Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T contextual linear bandits with dimension d simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r much smaller than d. We present a new algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Recommendations for Comprehensive and Independent Evaluation of Machine Learning-Based Earth System Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a revolutionary technology with demonstrable applications across multiple disciplines. Within the Earth science community, ML has been most visible for weather forecasting, producing forecasts that rival modern physics-based models. Given the importance of deepening our understanding and improving predictions of the Earth system on all time scales, efforts are now underway to develop forecasting models into Earth-system models (ESMs), capable of representing all components of the coupled Earth system (or their aggregated behavior) and their response to external changes. Modeling the Earth system is a much more difficult problem than weather forecasting, not least because the model must represent the alternate (e.g., future) coupled states of the system for which there are no historical observations. Given that the physical principles that enable predictions about the response of the Earth system are often not explicitly coded in these ML-based models, demonstrating the credibility of ML-based ESMs thus requires us to build evidence of their consistency with the physical system. To this end, this paper puts forward five recommendations to enhance comprehensive, standardized, and independent evaluation of ML-based ESMs to strengthen their credibility and promote their wider use.</description>

      <title>Rare-to-Frequent: Unlocking Compositional Generation Power of Diffusion Models on Rare Concepts with LLM Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

      <title>Exploring Gradient Subspaces: Addressing and Overcoming LoRA's Limitations in Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23111v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with direct-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Lipschitz Operators with respect to Gaussian Measures with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using ideas from machine learning, has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, hold promise to serve as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and engineering, complementing traditional numerical methods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of the underpinning mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators in expectation with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We further consider the reconstruction of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (adaptive) linear samples. A key finding is the tight characterization of the smallest achievable error for all possible (adaptive) sampling and reconstruction maps in terms of $m$. It is shown that Hermite polynomial approximation is an optimal recovery strategy, but we have the following curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz operators based on $m$ samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of the covariance operator of the Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate in the large data limit $m \to \infty$. A main focus of this work is on the recovery of Lipschitz operators from finitely many point samples. We use Christoffel sampling and weighted least-squares approximation to propose an algorithm which provably achieves near-optimal sample complexity in high probability.</description>

      <title>Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.</description>

      <title>Abstracted Shapes as Tokens -- A Generalizable and Interpretable Model for Time-series Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.</description>

      <title>CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human Intentions toward Public Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called CausalMob, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>LMS-AutoTSF: Learnable Multi-Scale Decomposition and Integrated Autocorrelation for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the increasing abuse of fraudulent activities that result in significant financial and reputational harm, Ethereum smart contracts face a significant problem in detecting fraud. Existing monitoring methods typically rely on lease code analysis or physically extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we use graph representation learning to observe purchase trends and find fraudulent deals. We can achieve powerful categorisation performance by using innovative machine learning versions and transforming Ethereum invoice data into graph structures. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) and Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN). Experimental results show that the MLP type surpasses the GCN in this environment, with domain-specific assessments closely aligned with real-world assessments. This study provides a scalable and efficient way to improve Ethereum's ecosystem's confidence and security.</description>

      <title>On Local Overfitting and Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infrequent occurrence of overfitting in deep neural networks is perplexing: contrary to theoretical expectations, increasing model size often enhances performance in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, though restricted to specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we propose a novel score that captures the forgetting rate of deep models on validation data. We posit that this score quantifies local overfitting: a decline in performance confined to certain regions of the data space. We then show empirically that local overfitting occurs regardless of the presence of traditional overfitting. Using the framework of deep over-parametrized linear models, we offer a certain theoretical characterization of forgotten knowledge, and show that it correlates with knowledge forgotten by real deep models. Finally, we devise a new ensemble method that aims to recover forgotten knowledge, relying solely on the training history of a single network. When combined with self-distillation, this method enhances the performance of any trained model without adding inference costs. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our method across multiple datasets, contemporary neural network architectures, and training protocols.</description>

      <title>Learning Causal Transition Matrix for Instance-dependent Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noisy labels are both inevitable and problematic in machine learning methods, as they negatively impact models' generalization ability by causing overfitting. In the context of learning with noise, the transition matrix plays a crucial role in the design of statistically consistent algorithms. However, the transition matrix is often considered unidentifiable. One strand of methods typically addresses this problem by assuming that the transition matrix is instance-independent; that is, the probability of mislabeling a particular instance is not influenced by its characteristics or attributes. This assumption is clearly invalid in complex real-world scenarios. To better understand the transition relationship and relax this assumption, we propose to study the data generation process of noisy labels from a causal perspective. We discover that an unobservable latent variable can affect either the instance itself, the label annotation procedure, or both, which complicates the identification of the transition matrix. To address various scenarios, we have unified these observations within a new causal graph. In this graph, the input instance is divided into a noise-resistant component and a noise-sensitive component based on whether they are affected by the latent variable. These two components contribute to identifying the ``causal transition matrix'', which approximates the true transition matrix with theoretical guarantee. In line with this, we have designed a novel training framework that explicitly models this causal relationship and, as a result, achieves a more accurate model for inferring the clean label.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving an 99.1% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a robust security mechanism that enforces mandatory access controls (MAC), but its policy language's complexity creates challenges for policy analysis and management. This research investigates the automation of SELinux policy analysis using graph-based techniques combined with machine learning approaches to detect policy anomalies. The study addresses two key questions: Can SELinux policy analysis be automated through graph analysis, and how do different anomaly detection models compare in analyzing SELinux policies? We will be comparing different machine learning models by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting policy violations and anomalies. Our approach utilizes Neo4j for graph representation of policies, with Node2vec transforming these graph structures into meaningful vector embeddings that can be processed by our machine learning models. In our results, the MLP Neural Network consistently demonstrated superior performance across different dataset sizes, achieving 95% accuracy with balanced precision and recall metrics, while both Random Forest and SVM models showed competitive but slightly lower performance in detecting policy violations. This combination of graph-based modeling and machine learning provides a more sophisticated and automated approach to understanding and analyzing complex SELinux policies compared to traditional manual analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Follow The Approximate Sparse Leader for No-Regret Online Sparse Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of \textit{online sparse linear approximation}, where one predicts the best sparse approximation of a sequence of measurements in terms of linear combination of columns of a given measurement matrix. Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.</description>

      <title>TabTreeFormer: Tabular Data Generation Using Hybrid Tree-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in tabular data generation. However, they lack domain-specific inductive biases which are critical to preserving the intrinsic characteristics of tabular data. Meanwhile, they suffer from poor scalability and efficiency due to quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we propose TabTreeFormer, a hybrid transformer architecture that incorporates a tree-based model that retains tabular-specific inductive biases of non-smooth and potentially low-correlated patterns caused by discreteness and non-rotational invariance, and hence enhances the fidelity and utility of synthetic data. In addition, we devise a dual-quantization tokenizer to capture the multimodal continuous distribution and further facilitate the learning of numerical value distribution. Moreover, our proposed tokenizer reduces the vocabulary size and sequence length due to the limited complexity (e.g., dimension-wise semantic meaning) of tabular data, rendering a significant model size shrink without sacrificing the capability of the transformer model. We evaluate TabTreeFormer on 10 datasets against multiple generative models on various metrics; our experimental results show that TabTreeFormer achieves superior fidelity, utility, privacy, and efficiency. Our best model yields a 40% utility improvement with 1/16 of the baseline model size.</description>

      <title>Catch Causal Signals from Edges for Label Imbalance in Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in causal research on graphs and its application to cracking label imbalance, the role of edge features in detecting the causal effects within graphs has been largely overlooked, leaving existing methods with untapped potential for further performance gains. In this paper, we enhance the causal attention mechanism through effectively leveraging edge information to disentangle the causal subgraph from the original graph, as well as further utilizing edge features to reshape graph representations. Capturing more comprehensive causal signals, our design leads to improved performance on graph classification tasks with label imbalance issues. We evaluate our approach on real-word datasets PTC, Tox21, and ogbg-molhiv, observing improvements over baselines. Overall, we highlight the importance of edge features in graph causal detection and provide a promising direction for addressing label imbalance challenges in graph-level tasks.

      <title>The Race to Efficiency: A New Perspective on AI Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large-scale AI models expand, training becomes costlier and sustaining progress grows harder. Classical scaling laws (e.g., Kaplan et al. (2020), Hoffmann et al. (2022)) predict training loss from a static compute budget yet neglect time and efficiency, prompting the question: how can we balance ballooning GPU fleets with rapidly improving hardware and algorithms? We introduce the relative-loss equation, a time- and efficiency-aware framework that extends classical AI scaling laws. Our model shows that, without ongoing efficiency gains, advanced performance could demand millennia of training or unrealistically large GPU fleets. However, near-exponential progress remains achievable if the "efficiency-doubling rate" parallels Moore's Law. By formalizing this race to efficiency, we offer a quantitative roadmap for balancing front-loaded GPU investments with incremental improvements across the AI stack. Empirical trends suggest that sustained efficiency gains can push AI scaling well into the coming decade, providing a new perspective on the diminishing returns inherent in classical scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an operator-based latent Markov representation of a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system, where the stochastic evolution of the latent state embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is described with the corresponding transfer operator, and develop a spectral method to learn this representation based on the theory of stochastic realization. The embedding may be learned simultaneously using reproducing kernels, for example, constructed with feed-forward neural networks. We also address the generalization of sequential state-estimation (Kalman filtering) in stochastic nonlinear systems, and of operator-based eigen-mode decomposition of dynamics, for the representation. Several examples with synthetic and real-world data are shown to illustrate the empirical characteristics of our methods, and to investigate the performance of our model in sequential state-estimation and mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>From Dense to Sparse: Event Response for Enhanced Residential Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential load forecasting (RLF) is crucial for resource scheduling in power systems. Most existing methods utilize all given load records (dense data) to indiscriminately extract the dependencies between historical and future time series. However, there exist important regular patterns residing in the event-related associations among different appliances (sparse knowledge), which have yet been ignored.In this paper, we propose an Event-Response Knowledge Guided approach (ERKG) for RLF by incorporating the estimation of electricity usage events for different appliances, mining event-related sparse knowledge from the load series. With ERKG, the event-response estimation enables portraying the electricity consumption behaviors of residents, revealing regular variations in appliance operational states.To be specific, ERKG consists of knowledge extraction and guidance: i) a forecasting model is designed for the electricity usage events by estimating appliance operational states, aiming to extract the event-related sparse knowledge; ii) a novel knowledge-guided mechanism is established by fusing such state estimates of the appliance events into the RLF model, which can give particular focuses on the patterns of users' electricity consumption behaviors.Notably, ERKG can flexibly serve as a plug-in module to boost the capability of existing forecasting models by leveraging event response. In numerical experiments, extensive comparisons and ablation studies have verified the effectiveness of our ERKG, e.g., over 8% MAE can be reduced on the tested state-of-the-art forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning Can Predict Videoconference Fluidity and Enjoyment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videoconferencing is now a frequent mode of communication in both professional and informal settings, yet it often lacks the fluidity and enjoyment of in-person conversation. This study leverages multimodal machine learning to predict moments of negative experience in videoconferencing. We sampled thousands of short clips from the RoomReader corpus, extracting audio embeddings, facial actions, and body motion features to train models for identifying low conversational fluidity, low enjoyment, and classifying conversational events (backchanneling, interruption, or gap). Our best models achieved an ROC-AUC of up to 0.87 on hold-out videoconference sessions, with domain-general audio features proving most critical. This work demonstrates that multimodal audio-video signals can effectively predict high-level subjective conversational outcomes. In addition, this is a contribution to research on videoconferencing user experience by showing that multimodal machine learning can be used to identify rare moments of negative user experience for further study or mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.11233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.</description>

      <title>GUPNet++: Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network for Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometry plays a significant role in monocular 3D object detection. It can be used to estimate object depth by using the perspective projection between object's physical size and 2D projection in the image plane, which can introduce mathematical priors into deep models. However, this projection process also introduces error amplification, where the error of the estimated height is amplified and reflected into the projected depth. It leads to unreliable depth inferences and also impairs training stability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network (GUPNet++) by modeling geometry projection in a probabilistic manner. This ensures depth predictions are well-bounded and associated with a reasonable uncertainty. The significance of introducing such geometric uncertainty is two-fold: (1). It models the uncertainty propagation relationship of the geometry projection during training, improving the stability and efficiency of the end-to-end model learning. (2). It can be derived to a highly reliable confidence to indicate the quality of the 3D detection result, enabling more reliable detection inference. Experiments show that the proposed approach not only obtains (state-of-the-art) SOTA performance in image-based monocular 3D detection but also demonstrates superiority in efficacy with a simplified framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has found significant success in learning models of complex, real-world dynamical systems, enabling prediction and control. The greater interpretability and lower computational costs of these models, compared to traditional machine learning methodologies, make Koopman learning an especially appealing approach. Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to leverage its own failures. To address this, we equip Koopman methods -- developed for predicting non-autonomous time-series -- with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data. Our framework has considerable potential for expansion, allowing for future advances, and opens exciting new directions for Koopman learning.</description>

      <title>AllSpark: A Multimodal Spatio-Temporal General Intelligence Model with Ten Modalities via Language as a Reference Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging multimodal data is an inherent requirement for comprehending geographic objects. However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific special words for which little or no labeled data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose a self-supervised continual learning approach: Given the audio of a lecture talk with the corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation data set. Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generative Modeling via Penalized Optimal Transport Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic data with distributions that faithfully emulate the underlying data-generating mechanism holds paramount significance. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) have emerged as a prominent tool for this task; however, due to the delicate equilibrium of the minimax formulation and the instability of Wasserstein distance in high dimensions, WGAN often manifests the pathological phenomenon of mode collapse. This results in generated samples that converge to a restricted set of outputs and fail to adequately capture the tail behaviors of the true distribution. Such limitations can lead to serious downstream consequences. To this end, we propose the Penalized Optimal Transport Network (POTNet), a versatile deep generative model based on the marginally-penalized Wasserstein (MPW) distance. Through the MPW distance, POTNet effectively leverages low-dimensional marginal information to guide the overall alignment of joint distributions. Furthermore, our primal-based framework enables direct evaluation of the MPW distance, thus eliminating the need for a critic network. This formulation circumvents training instabilities inherent in adversarial approaches and avoids the need for extensive parameter tuning. We derive a non-asymptotic bound on the generalization error of the MPW loss and establish convergence rates of the generative distribution learned by POTNet. Our theoretical analysis together with extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of POTNet in accurately capturing underlying data structures, including their tail behaviors and minor modalities. Moreover, our model achieves orders of magnitude speedup during the sampling stage compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, which enables computationally efficient large-scale synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>Boosting of Thoughts: Trial-and-Error Problem Solving with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.</description>

      <title>Scaling Efficient LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.</description>

      <title>Approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances between parametric statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance between two probability distributions of a statistical model is defined as the Riemannian geodesic distance induced by the Fisher information metric. In order to calculate the Fisher-Rao distance in closed-form, we need (1) to elicit a formula for the Fisher-Rao geodesics, and (2) to integrate the Fisher length element along those geodesics. We consider several numerically robust approximation and bounding techniques for the Fisher-Rao distances: First, we report generic upper bounds on Fisher-Rao distances based on closed-form 1D Fisher-Rao distances of submodels. Second, we describe several generic approximation schemes depending on whether the Fisher-Rao geodesics or pregeodesics are available in closed-form or not. In particular, we obtain a generic method to guarantee an arbitrarily small additive error on the approximation provided that Fisher-Rao pregeodesics and tight lower and upper bounds are available. Third, we consider the case of Fisher metrics being Hessian metrics, and report generic tight upper bounds on the Fisher-Rao distances using techniques of information geometry. Uniparametric and biparametric statistical models always have Fisher Hessian metrics, and in general a simple test allows to check whether the Fisher information matrix yields a Hessian metric or not. Fourth, we consider elliptical distribution families and show how to apply the above techniques to these models. We also propose two new distances based either on the Fisher-Rao lengths of curves serving as proxies of Fisher-Rao geodesics, or based on the Birkhoff/Hilbert projective cone distance. Last, we consider an alternative group-theoretic approach for statistical transformation models based on the notion of maximal invariant which yields insights on the structures of the Fisher-Rao distance formula which may be used fruitfully in applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting risk of cardiovascular disease using retinal OCT imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. Non-invasive, cost-effective imaging techniques play a crucial role in early detection and prevention of CVD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has gained recognition as a potential tool for early CVD risk prediction, though its use remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the potential of OCT as an additional imaging technique to predict future CVD events. We analysed retinal OCT data from the UK Biobank. The dataset included 612 patients who suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke within five years of imaging and 2,234 controls without CVD (total: 2,846 participants). A self-supervised deep learning approach based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) was used to extract low-dimensional latent representations from high-dimensional 3D OCT images, capturing distinct features of retinal layers. These latent features, along with clinical data, were used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier to differentiate between patients at risk of future CVD events (MI or stroke) and healthy controls. Our model achieved an AUC of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.70, and accuracy of 0.70, outperforming the QRISK3 score (the third version of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk prediction algorithm; AUC = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.60, specificity = 0.55, accuracy = 0.55). The choroidal layer in OCT images was identified as a key predictor of future CVD events, revealed through a novel model explainability approach. This study demonstrates that retinal OCT imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasive alternative for predicting CVD risk, offering potential for widespread application in optometry practices and hospitals.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Accelerated MR Cholangiopancreatography without Fully-sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) acquisitions using deep learning-based (DL) reconstruction at 3T and 0.55T. A total of 35 healthy volunteers underwent conventional two-fold accelerated MRCP scans at field strengths of 3T and 0.55T. We trained DL reconstructions using two different training strategies, supervised (SV) and self-supervised (SSV), with retrospectively six-fold undersampled data obtained at 3T. We then evaluated the DL reconstructions against standard techniques, parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS), focusing on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) as metrics. We also tested DL reconstructions with prospectively accelerated acquisitions and evaluated their robustness when changing fields strengths from 3T to 0.55T. DL reconstructions demonstrated a reduction in average acquisition time from 599/542 to 255/180 seconds for MRCP at 3T/0.55T. In both retrospective and prospective undersampling, PSNR and SSIM of DL reconstructions were higher than those of PI and CS. At the same time, DL reconstructions preserved the image quality of undersampled data, including sharpness and the visibility of hepatobiliary ducts. In addition, both DL approaches produced high-quality reconstructions at 0.55T. In summary, DL reconstructions trained for highly accelerated MRCP enabled a reduction in acquisition time by a factor of 2.4/3.0 at 3T/0.55T while maintaining the image quality of conventional acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Dataset Decomposition: Faster LLM Training with Variable Sequence Length Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length (concat-and-chunk). Recent attention implementations mask cross-document attention, reducing the effective length of a chunk of tokens. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch-size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a computational cost proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy with up to 6x faster training compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.</description>

      <title>Learning the Language of Protein Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning and \emph{de novo} generation of proteins are pivotal computational biology tasks. Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \AA. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.</description>

      <title>Concept Matching with Agent for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. To expand the usage scenarios of LLM, some works enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the model by introducing more external information, which is called the agent paradigm. Based on this idea, we propose a new method that integrates the agent paradigm into out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to improve its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures) where the objective function is nonconvex along generalized geodesics. Specifically, the objective exhibits some difference-of-convex structure along these geodesics. The setting also encompasses sampling problems where the logarithm of the target distribution is difference-of-convex. We derive multiple convergence insights for a novel semi Forward-Backward Euler scheme under several nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) regimes. Notably, the semi Forward-Backward Euler is just a slight modification of the Forward-Backward Euler whose convergence is -- to our knowledge -- still unknown in our very general non-geodesically-convex setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>ChatBug: A Common Vulnerability of Aligned LLMs Induced by Chat Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are expected to follow instructions from users and engage in conversations. Techniques to enhance LLMs' instruction-following capabilities typically fine-tune them using data structured according to a predefined chat template. Although chat templates are shown to be effective in optimizing LLM performance, their impact on safety alignment of LLMs has been less understood, which is crucial for deploying LLMs safely at scale.
  In this paper, we investigate how chat templates affect safety alignment of LLMs. We identify a common vulnerability, named ChatBug, that is introduced by chat templates. Our key insight to identify ChatBug is that the chat templates provide a rigid format that need to be followed by LLMs, but not by users. Hence, a malicious user may not necessarily follow the chat template when prompting LLMs. Instead, malicious users could leverage their knowledge of the chat template and accordingly craft their prompts to bypass safety alignments of LLMs. We develop two attacks to exploit the ChatBug vulnerability. We demonstrate that a malicious user can exploit the ChatBug vulnerability of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and effectively elicit unintended responses from these models. Moreover, we show that ChatBug can be exploited by existing jailbreak attacks to enhance their attack success rates. We investigate potential countermeasures to ChatBug. Our results show that while adversarial training effectively mitigates the ChatBug vulnerability, the victim model incurs significant performance degradation. These results highlight the trade-off between safety alignment and helpfulness. Developing new methods for instruction tuning to balance this trade-off is an open and critical direction for future research</description>

      <title>ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Image-Level Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection of longitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients over time, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

      <title>Statistical Error Bounds for GANs with Nonlinear Objective Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised learning methods for training a generator distribution to produce samples that approximate those drawn from a target distribution. Many such methods can be formulated as minimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions. Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based on integral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the 1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linear functional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A much larger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructed using $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\alpha$-divergences) together with a regularizing discriminator space $\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitz functions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on the choice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a number of applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\Gamma$ in the form of finite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statistical consistency of $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANs in the appropriate limit. Finally, our results also give new insight into the performance of GANs for distributions with unbounded support.</description>

      <title>T-FREE: Subword Tokenizer-Free Generative LLMs via Sparse Representations for Memory-Efficient Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenizers are crucial for encoding information in Large Language Models, but their development has recently stagnated, and they contain inherent weaknesses. Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.
  To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-FREE shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Edge Graph Intelligence: Reciprocally Empowering Edge Networks with Graph Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a thriving growth of computing facilities connected at the network edge, cultivating edge networks as a fundamental infrastructure for supporting miscellaneous intelligent services.Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) frontiers have extrapolated to the graph domain and promoted Graph Intelligence (GI). Given the inherent relation between graphs and networks, the interdiscipline of graph learning and edge networks, i.e., Edge GI or EGI, has revealed a novel interplay between them -- GI aids in optimizing edge networks, while edge networks facilitate GI model deployment. Driven by this delicate closed-loop, EGI is recognized as a promising solution to fully unleash the potential of edge computing power and is garnering growing attention. Nevertheless, research on EGI remains nascent, and there is a soaring demand within both the communications and AI communities for a dedicated venue to share recent advancements. To this end, this paper promotes the concept of EGI, explores its scope and core principles, and conducts a comprehensive survey concerning recent research efforts on this emerging field. Specifically, this paper introduces and discusses: 1) fundamentals of edge computing and graph learning,2) emerging techniques centering on the closed loop between graph intelligence and edge networks, and 3) open challenges and research opportunities of future EGI. By bridging the gap across communication, networking, and graph learning areas, we believe that this survey can garner increased attention, foster meaningful discussions, and inspire further research ideas in EGI.</description>

      <title>ALTBI: Constructing Improved Outlier Detection Models via Optimization of Inlier-Memorization Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is the task of identifying unusual observations (or outliers) from a given or upcoming data by learning unique patterns of normal observations (or inliers). Recently, a study introduced a powerful unsupervised OD (UOD) solver based on a new observation of deep generative models, called inlier-memorization (IM) effect, which suggests that generative models memorize inliers before outliers in early learning stages. In this study, we aim to develop a theoretically principled method to address UOD tasks by maximally utilizing the IM effect. We begin by observing that the IM effect is observed more clearly when the given training data contain fewer outliers. This finding indicates a potential for enhancing the IM effect in UOD regimes if we can effectively exclude outliers from mini-batches when designing the loss function. To this end, we introduce two main techniques: 1) increasing the mini-batch size as the model training proceeds and 2) using an adaptive threshold to calculate the truncated loss function. We theoretically show that these two techniques effectively filter out outliers from the truncated loss function, allowing us to utilize the IM effect to the fullest. Coupled with an additional ensemble strategy, we propose our method and term it Adaptive Loss Truncation with Batch Increment (ALTBI). We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate that ALTBI achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying outliers compared to other recent methods, even with significantly lower computation costs. Additionally, we show that our method yields robust performances when combined with privacy-preserving algorithms.</description>

      <title>From Glucose Patterns to Health Outcomes: A Generalizable Foundation Model for Continuous Glucose Monitor Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in SSL enabled novel medical AI models, known as foundation models, offer great potential for better characterizing health from diverse biomedical data. CGM provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model for CGM data that learns nuanced glycemic patterns and translates them into predictive representations of metabolic health. Trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 adults, primarily without diabetes, GluFormer uses autoregressive token prediction to capture longitudinal glucose dynamics. We show that GluFormer generalizes to 19 external cohorts (n=6,044) spanning different ethnicities and ages, 5 countries, 8 CGM devices, and diverse pathophysiological states. GluFormers representations exceed the performance of current CGM metrics, such as the Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), for forecasting clinical measures. In a longitudinal study of 580 adults with CGM data and 12-year follow-up, GluFormer identifies individuals at elevated risk of developing diabetes more effectively than blood HbA1C%, capturing 66% of all new-onset diabetes diagnoses in the top quartile versus 7% in the bottom quartile. Similarly, 69% of cardiovascular-death events occurred in the top quartile with none in the bottom quartile, demonstrating powerful risk stratification beyond traditional glycemic metrics. We also show that CGM representations from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the multi-modal version of the model can accurately generate CGM data based on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods.</description>

      <title>In Search of Trees: Decision-Tree Policy Synthesis for Black-Box Systems via Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision trees, owing to their interpretability, are attractive as control policies for (dynamical) systems. Unfortunately, constructing, or synthesising, such policies is a challenging task. Previous approaches do so by imitating a neural-network policy, approximating a tabular policy obtained via formal synthesis, employing reinforcement learning, or modelling the problem as a mixed-integer linear program. However, these works may require access to a hard-to-obtain accurate policy or a formal model of the environment (within reach of formal synthesis), and may not provide guarantees on the quality or size of the final tree policy. In contrast, we present an approach to synthesise optimal decision-tree policies given a deterministic black-box environment and specification, a discretisation of the tree predicates, and an initial set of states, where optimality is defined with respect to the number of steps to achieve the goal. Our approach is a specialised search algorithm which systematically explores the (exponentially large) space of decision trees under the given discretisation. The key component is a novel trace-based pruning mechanism that significantly reduces the search space. Our approach represents a conceptually novel way of synthesising small decision-tree policies with optimality guarantees even for black-box environments with black-box specifications.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and investigate algorithms for the structured orthogonal dictionary learning problem. First, we investigate the case when the dictionary is a Householder matrix. We give sample complexity results and show theoretically guaranteed approximate recovery (in the $l_{\infty}$ sense) with optimal computational complexity. We then attempt to generalize these techniques when the dictionary is a product of a few Householder matrices. We numerically validate these techniques in the sample-limited setting to show performance similar to or better than existing techniques while having much improved computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Deploying Open-Source Large Language Models: A performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Driven Generalizable Framework for Deepfake Face Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of digital image manipulation, particularly with the advancement of deep generative models, significantly challenges existing deepfake detection methods, especially when the origin of the deepfake is obscure. To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models. Our method showcases outstanding performance, achieving an average AUC of 0.749 for cross-data generalization and 0.893 for robustness against unseen deepfakes, outperforming all compared methods. The code can be reproduced from the repo: \url{https://github.com/lalithbharadwajbaru/Wavelet-CLIP}</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</description>

      <title>Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of the DRL model for malware attribution involved extensive research, iterative coding, and numerous adjustments based on the insights gathered from predecessor models and contemporary research papers. This preparatory work was essential to establish a robust foundation for the model, ensuring it could adapt and respond effectively to the dynamic nature of malware threats. Initially, the model struggled with low accuracy levels, but through persistent adjustments to its architecture and learning algorithms, accuracy improved dramatically from about 7 percent to over 73 percent in early iterations. By the end of the training, the model consistently reached accuracy levels near 98 percent, demonstrating its strong capability to accurately recognise and attribute malware activities. This upward trajectory in training accuracy is graphically represented in the Figure, which vividly illustrates the model maturation and increasing proficiency over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile and visual perception are both crucial for humans to perform fine-grained interactions with their environment. Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

      <title>Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Countering Backdoor Attacks in Image Recognition: A Survey and Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep learning across various industries has introduced substantial challenges, particularly in terms of model explainability and security. The inherent complexity of deep learning models, while contributing to their effectiveness, also renders them susceptible to adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are especially concerning, as they involve surreptitiously embedding specific triggers within training data, causing the model to exhibit aberrant behavior when presented with input containing the triggers. Such attacks often exploit vulnerabilities in outsourced processes, compromising model integrity without affecting performance on clean (trigger-free) input data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies designed to counter backdoor attacks in image recognition. We provide an in-depth analysis of the theoretical foundations, practical efficacy, and limitations of these approaches. In addition, we conduct an extensive benchmarking of sixteen state-of-the-art approaches against eight distinct backdoor attacks, utilizing three datasets, four model architectures, and three poisoning ratios. Our results, derived from 122,236 individual experiments, indicate that while many approaches provide some level of protection, their performance can vary considerably. Furthermore, when compared to two seminal approaches, most newer approaches do not demonstrate substantial improvements in overall performance or consistency across diverse settings. Drawing from these findings, we propose potential directions for developing more effective and generalizable defensive mechanisms in the future.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>{\lambda}: A Benchmark for Data-Efficiency in Long-Horizon Indoor Mobile Manipulation Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</description>

      <title>Probability-density-aware Semi-supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumes that neighbor points lie in the same category (neighbor assumption), and points in different clusters belong to various categories (cluster assumption). Existing methods usually rely on similarity measures to retrieve the similar neighbor points, ignoring cluster assumption, which may not utilize unlabeled information sufficiently and effectively. This paper first provides a systematical investigation into the significant role of probability density in SSL and lays a solid theoretical foundation for cluster assumption. To this end, we introduce a Probability-Density-Aware Measure (PM) to discern the similarity between neighbor points. To further improve Label Propagation, we also design a Probability-Density-Aware Measure Label Propagation (PMLP) algorithm to fully consider the cluster assumption in label propagation. Last but not least, we prove that traditional pseudo-labeling could be viewed as a particular case of PMLP, which provides a comprehensive theoretical understanding of PMLP's superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMLP achieves outstanding performance compared with other recent methods.</description>

      <title>PlanLLM: Video Procedure Planning with Refinable Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</description>

      <title>An In-Depth Analysis of Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation for Digit Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts.

      <title>GDSR: Global-Detail Integration through Dual-Branch Network with Wavelet Losses for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and State Space Models, have achieved significant progress in Remote Sensing Image (RSI) Super-Resolution (SR). However, existing SR methods typically overlook the complementary relationship between global and local dependencies. These methods either focus on capturing local information or prioritize global information, which results in models that are unable to effectively capture both global and local features simultaneously. Moreover, their computational cost becomes prohibitive when applied to large-scale RSIs. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel application of Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) to RSI-SR, which captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity. To simultaneously model global and local features, we propose the Global-Detail dual-branch structure, GDSR, which performs SR reconstruction by paralleling RWKV and convolutional operations to handle large-scale RSIs. Furthermore, we introduce the Global-Detail Reconstruction Module (GDRM) as an intermediary between the two branches to bridge their complementary roles. In addition, we propose Wavelet Loss, a loss function that effectively captures high-frequency detail information in images, thereby enhancing the visual quality of SR, particularly in terms of detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including AID, AID_CDM, RSSRD-QH, and RSSRD-QH_CDM, demonstrate that GSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method HAT by an average of 0.05 dB in PSNR, while using only 63% of its parameters and 51% of its FLOPs, achieving an inference speed 2.9 times faster. Furthermore, the Wavelet Loss shows excellent generalization across various architectures, providing a novel perspective for RSI-SR enhancement.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in model checking have demonstrated significant potential across diverse applications, particularly in signal and image analysis. Medical imaging stands out as a critical domain where model checking can be effectively applied to design and evaluate robust frameworks. These frameworks facilitate automatic and semi-automatic delineation of regions of interest within images, aiding in accurate segmentation. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of recent works leveraging spatial logic to develop operators and tools for identifying regions of interest, including tumorous and non-tumorous areas. Additionally, we examine the challenges inherent to spatial model-checking techniques, such as variability in ground truth data and the need for streamlined procedures suitable for routine clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning via Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used method for classification. However, the high dimensionality of predictors combined with small sample sizes often results in large classification errors. To address this challenge, it is crucial to leverage data from related source models to enhance the classification performance of a target model. We propose to address this problem in the framework of transfer learning.
  In this paper, we present novel transfer learning methods via regularized random-effects linear discriminant analysis, where the discriminant direction is estimated as a weighted combination of ridge estimates obtained from both the target and source models. Multiple strategies for determining these weights are introduced and evaluated, including one that minimizes the estimation risk of the discriminant vector and another that minimizes the classification error. Utilizing results from random matrix theory, we explicitly derive the asymptotic values of these weights and the associated classification error rates in the high-dimensional setting, where $p/n \rightarrow \gamma$, with $p$ representing the predictor dimension and $n$ the sample size. We also provide geometric interpretations of various weights and a guidance on which weights to choose. Extensive numerical studies, including simulations and analysis of proteomics-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Piano Transcription by Hierarchical Language Modeling with Pretrained Roll-based Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), aiming to get musical notes from raw audio, typically uses frame-level systems with piano-roll outputs or language model (LM)-based systems with note-level predictions. However, frame-level systems require manual thresholding, while the LM-based systems struggle with long sequences. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method combining pre-trained roll-based encoders with an LM decoder to leverage the strengths of both methods. Besides, our approach employs a hierarchical prediction strategy, first predicting onset and pitch, then velocity, and finally offset. The hierarchical prediction strategy reduces computational costs by breaking down long sequences into different hierarchies. Evaluated on two benchmark roll-based encoders, our method outperforms traditional piano-roll outputs 0.01 and 0.022 in onset-offset-velocity F1 score, demonstrating its potential as a performance-enhancing plug-in for arbitrary roll-based music transcription encoder.</description>

      <title>PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.</description>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in collaborative recommendation through their ability to conduct high-order representation smoothing, effectively capturing structural information within users' interaction patterns. However, existing GNN paradigms face significant challenges in scalability and robustness when handling large-scale, noisy, and real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we present LightGNN, a lightweight and distillation-based GNN pruning framework designed to substantially reduce model complexity while preserving essential collaboration modeling capabilities. Our LightGNN framework introduces a computationally efficient pruning module that adaptively identifies and removes redundant edges and embedding entries for model compression. The framework is guided by a resource-friendly hierarchical knowledge distillation objective, whose intermediate layer augments the observed graph to maintain performance, particularly in high-rate compression scenarios. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate LightGNN's effectiveness, significantly improving both computational efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Notably, LightGNN achieves an 80% reduction in edge count and 90% reduction in embedding entries while maintaining performance comparable to more complex state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of our LightGNN framework is available at the github repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGNN.</description>
