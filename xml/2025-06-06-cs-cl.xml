      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Disease Labeling in CT Radiology Reports Across Organ Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in automating disease annotation of CT radiology reports. We compare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight open-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) CT reports.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports from 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three organ systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset. Three open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.
  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and Gemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the manually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed by Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE dataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3 27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing labeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.
  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report annotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting. However, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language. LLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment and user needs.</description>

      <title>FailureSensorIQ: A Multi-Choice QA Dataset for Understanding Sensor Relationships and Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FailureSensorIQ, a novel Multi-Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) benchmarking system designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and understand complex, domain-specific scenarios in Industry 4.0. Unlike traditional QA benchmarks, our system focuses on multiple aspects of reasoning through failure modes, sensor data, and the relationships between them across various industrial assets. Through this work, we envision a paradigm shift where modeling decisions are not only data-driven using statistical tools like correlation analysis and significance tests, but also domain-driven by specialized LLMs which can reason about the key contributors and useful patterns that can be captured with feature engineering. We evaluate the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs-including GPT-4, Llama, and Mistral-on FailureSensorIQ from different lens using Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity analysis, Expert Evaluation study, Asset-Specific Knowledge Gap analysis, ReAct agent using external knowledge-bases. Even though closed-source models with strong reasoning capabilities approach expert-level performance, the comprehensive benchmark reveals a significant drop in performance that is fragile to perturbations, distractions, and inherent knowledge gaps in the models. We also provide a real-world case study of how LLMs can drive the modeling decisions on 3 different failure prediction datasets related to various assets. We release: (a) expert-curated MCQA for various industrial assets, (b) FailureSensorIQ benchmark and Hugging Face leaderboard based on MCQA built from non-textual data found in ISO documents, and (c) LLMFeatureSelector, an LLM-based feature selection scikit-learn pipeline. The software is available at https://github.com/IBM/FailureSensorIQ.</description>

      <title>HyperSteer: Activation Steering at Scale with Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training. Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Reasoning Potential of Pre-trained LLMs by Critique Fine-Tuning on One Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03295v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Instructions to ODRL Usage Policies: An Ontology Guided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an approach that uses large language models such as GPT-4 to generate usage policies in the W3C Open Digital Rights Language ODRL automatically from natural language instructions. Our approach uses the ODRL ontology and its documentation as a central part of the prompt. Our research hypothesis is that a curated version of existing ontology documentation will better guide policy generation. We present various heuristics for adapting the ODRL ontology and its documentation to guide an end-to-end KG construction process. We evaluate our approach in the context of dataspaces, i.e., distributed infrastructures for trustworthy data exchange between multiple participating organizations for the cultural domain. We created a benchmark consisting of 12 use cases of varying complexity. Our evaluation shows excellent results with up to 91.95% accuracy in the resulting knowledge graph.</description>

      <title>Hopscotch: Discovering and Skipping Redundancies in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.</description>

      <title>The Reader is the Metric: How Textual Features and Reader Profiles Explain Conflicting Evaluations of AI Creative Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies comparing AI-generated and human-authored literary texts have produced conflicting results: some suggest AI already surpasses human quality, while others argue it still falls short. We start from the hypothesis that such divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze these vectors in a shared "preference space". Reader vectors cluster into two profiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize readability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our results quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a function of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These findings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of creative text generation.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Violence Detection on Social Media: A Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violent threats remain a significant problem across social media platforms. Useful, high-quality data facilitates research into the understanding and detection of malicious content, including violence. In this paper, we introduce a cross-platform dataset of 30,000 posts hand-coded for violent threats and sub-types of violence, including political and sexual violence. To evaluate the signal present in this dataset, we perform a machine learning analysis with an existing dataset of violent comments from YouTube. We find that, despite originating from different platforms and using different coding criteria, we achieve high classification accuracy both by training on one dataset and testing on the other, and in a merged dataset condition. These results have implications for content-classification strategies and for understanding violent content across social media.</description>

      <title>Ask a Local: Detecting Hallucinations With Specialized Model Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) - instances where models generate plausible but factually incorrect information - present a significant challenge for AI.
  We introduce "Ask a Local", a novel hallucination detection method exploiting the intuition that specialized models exhibit greater surprise when encountering domain-specific inaccuracies. Our approach computes divergence between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models to identify potentially hallucinated spans. Our method is particularly well-suited for a multilingual context, as it naturally scales to multiple languages without the need for adaptation, relying on external data sources, or performing training. Moreover, we select computationally efficient models, providing a scalable solution that can be applied to a wide range of languages and domains.
  Our results on a human-annotated question-answer dataset spanning 14 languages demonstrate consistent performance across languages, with Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores around 0.3 and comparable Spearman correlation values. Our model shows particularly strong performance on Italian and Catalan, with IoU scores of 0.42 and 0.38, respectively, while maintaining cross-lingual effectiveness without language-specific adaptations. We release our code and architecture to facilitate further research in multilingual hallucination detection.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional Pipeline for Fine-grained Crowdsourcing Earthquake Damage Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective emergency response, yet remains challenging due to limited ground sensors and delays in official reporting. Social media provides a rich, real-time source of human-centric observations, but its multimodal and unstructured nature presents challenges for traditional analytical methods. In this study, we propose a structured Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional (3M) pipeline that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess disaster impacts. We evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using both macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively integrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with ground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language, epicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of MLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in applying MLLMs to real-time crisis contexts.

      <title>Trajectory Prediction Meets Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>DistRAG: Towards Distance-Based Spatial Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Time Course MechInterp: Analyzing the Evolution of Components and Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire and store factual knowledge is crucial for enhancing their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we analyze the evolution of factual knowledge representation in the OLMo-7B model by tracking the roles of its attention heads and feed forward networks (FFNs) over the course of pre-training. We classify these components into four roles: general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific, and examine their stability and transitions. Our results show that LLMs initially depend on broad, general-purpose components, which later specialize as training progresses. Once the model reliably predicts answers, some components are repurposed, suggesting an adaptive learning process. Notably, attention heads display the highest turnover. We also present evidence that FFNs remain more stable throughout training. Furthermore, our probing experiments reveal that location-based relations converge to high accuracy earlier in training than name-based relations, highlighting how task complexity shapes acquisition dynamics. These insights offer a mechanistic view of knowledge formation in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Toxic language detection is crucial for creating safer online environments and limiting the spread of harmful content. While toxic language detection has been under-explored in Persian, the current work compares different methods for this task, including fine-tuning, data enrichment, zero-shot and few-shot learning, and cross-lingual transfer learning. What is especially compelling is the impact of cultural context on transfer learning for this task: We show that the language of a country with cultural similarities to Persian yields better results in transfer learning. Conversely, the improvement is lower when the language comes from a culturally distinct country. Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic language that may disturb some readers. These examples are included for the purpose of research on toxic detection.</description>

      <title>Delta-KNN: Improving Demonstration Selection in In-Context Learning for Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia, and early intervention can greatly benefit from analyzing linguistic abnormalities. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as health assistants for AD diagnosis from patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL), where tasks are defined through a few input-output examples. Empirical results reveal that conventional ICL methods, such as similarity-based selection, perform poorly for AD diagnosis, likely due to the inherent complexity of this task. To address this, we introduce Delta-KNN, a novel demonstration selection strategy that enhances ICL performance. Our method leverages a delta score to assess the relative gains of each training example, coupled with a KNN-based retriever that dynamically selects optimal "representatives" for a given input. Experiments on two AD detection datasets across three open-source LLMs demonstrate that Delta-KNN consistently outperforms existing ICL baselines. Notably, when using the Llama-3.1 model, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, surpassing even supervised classifiers.</description>

      <title>APT: Improving Specialist LLM Performance with Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI: XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI techniques to enhance AI model training.</description>

      <title>EpiCoDe: Boosting Model Performance Beyond Training with Extrapolation and Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on the availability of abundant high-quality training data. However, the high cost of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three tasks over four different LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios, which further helps us better understand the effectiveness of EpiCoDe.</description>

      <title>Beyond Memorization: A Rigorous Evaluation Framework for Medical Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03490v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring Human Involvement in AI-Generated Text: A Case Study on Academic Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models. Our code is available at https://github.com/gyc-nii/CAS-CS-and-dual-head-detector</description>

      <title>Accurate Sublayer Pruning for Large Language Models by Exploiting Latency and Tunability Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we accelerate large language models(LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy? The slow inference speed of LLMs hinders us to benefit from their remarkable performance in diverse applications. This is mainly because numerous sublayers are stacked together in LLMs. Sublayer pruning compresses and expedites LLMs via removing unnecessary sublayers. However, existing sublayer pruning algorithms are limited in accuracy since they naively select sublayers to prune, overlooking the different characteristics of each sublayer. In this paper, we propose SPRINT (Sublayer PRuning wIth LateNcy and Tunability Information), an accurate sublayer pruning method for LLMs. SPRINT accurately selects a target sublayer to prune by considering 1) the amount of latency reduction after pruning and 2) the tunability of sublayers. SPRINT iteratively prunes redundant sublayers and swiftly tunes the parameters of remaining sublayers. Experiments show that SPRINT achieves the best accuracy-speedup trade-off, exhibiting up to 23.88%p higher accuracy on zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks compared to existing pruning algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Task-Oriented Dialogue Policy: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Injected by Elite Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03519v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces. This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times. Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks.</description>

      <title>TokAlign: Efficient Vocabulary Adaptation via Token Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization serves as a foundational step for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process text. In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named TokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view, and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4$\text{e}^2$ of strong baseline methods to 1.2$\text{e}^2$ after initialization. Experimental results on models across multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the vanilla model. After unifying vocabularies between LLMs, token-level distillation can remarkably boost (+4.4% than sentence-level distillation) the base model, costing only 235M tokens.</description>

      <title>Seed-Coder: Let the Code Model Curate Data for Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03524v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction. Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software engineering tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in digital agents is their lack of understanding of their environment. For instance, a web browsing agent may get lost in unfamiliar websites, uncertain what pages must be visited to achieve its goals. To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark, collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark, beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.</description>

      <title>Debate, Reflect, and Distill: Multi-Agent Feedback with Tree-Structured Preference Optimization for Efficient Language Model Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&amp;R) framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis, corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy, robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large margin.</description>

      <title>BPO: Revisiting Preference Modeling in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as a popular method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward magnitudes. This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor performance. We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor. Unlike previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without introducing additional constraints to the loss function. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (18.8% to 28.9%) and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B (35.0% to 46.7%). It also surpasses DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO (43.1%), +5.0% over SLiC (41.7%), and +3.1% over Cal-DPO (43.6%) on the same model. Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.</description>

      <title>ConsistentChat: Building Skeleton-Guided Consistent Dialogues for Large Language Models from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000 multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light, Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.</description>

      <title>POSS: Position Specialist Generates Better Draft for Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by using a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model to verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s). Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and speed-up ratio.

      <description>arXiv:2506.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We open-source MiMo-VL-7B-SFT and MiMo-VL-7B-RL, two powerful vision-language models delivering state-of-the-art performance in both general visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. MiMo-VL-7B-RL outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 35 out of 40 evaluated tasks, and scores 59.4 on OlympiadBench, surpassing models with up to 78B parameters. For GUI grounding applications, it sets a new standard with 56.1 on OSWorld-G, even outperforming specialized models such as UI-TARS. Our training combines four-stage pre-training (2.4 trillion tokens) with Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning (MORL) integrating diverse reward signals. We identify the importance of incorporating high-quality reasoning data with long Chain-of-Thought into pre-training stages, and the benefits of mixed RL despite challenges in simultaneous multi-domain optimization. We also contribute a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 50+ tasks to promote reproducibility and advance the field. The model checkpoints and full evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL.</description>

      <title>FreePRM: Training Process Reward Models Without Ground Truth Process Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated that Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing model performance. However, training PRMs typically requires step-level labels, either manually annotated or automatically generated, which can be costly and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this challenge, we introduce FreePRM, a weakly supervised framework for training PRMs without access to ground-truth step-level labels. FreePRM first generates pseudo step-level labels based on the correctness of final outcome, and then employs Buffer Probability to eliminate impact of noise inherent in pseudo labeling. Experimental results show that FreePRM achieves an average F1 score of 53.0% on ProcessBench, outperforming fully supervised PRM trained on Math-Shepherd by +24.1%. Compared to other open-source PRMs, FreePRM outperforms upon RLHFlow-PRM-Mistral-8B (28.4%) by +24.6%, EurusPRM (31.3%) by +21.7%, and Skywork-PRM-7B (42.1%) by +10.9%. This work introduces a new paradigm in PRM training, significantly reducing reliance on costly step-level annotations while maintaining strong performance.</description>

      <title>Exchange of Perspective Prompting Enhances Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in addressing diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance is often limited by inherent comprehension of problems. To address this limitation, we propose Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP), a novel framework designed to exchange perspectives across different definitions of problem, so that it can break the fixed mindset from any particular formulation of the question. We conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on 8 benchmarks. The results show that EoP can significantly improve performance. For instance, compared to the non-commutative baseline PHP, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and EoP, we observe a 3.6% improvement on AQuA (60.6% to 64.2%), while GPT-4-powered EoP demonstrates a 7.7% overall accuracy enhancement on Math (53.9% to 61.6%) and a 3.5% improvement on OlympiadBench Maths (43.5% to 47.0%) when using Qwen-2.5-72b.</description>

      <title>KG-BiLM: Knowledge Graph Embedding via Bidirectional Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.</description>

      <title>Automatically Suggesting Diverse Example Sentences for L2 Japanese Learners Using Pre-Trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners' proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition. This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners. We utilize PLMs in two ways: as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using zero-shot learning. We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers -- and GPT-4. Our findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower scores on average. Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore improve the language learning journey.</description>

      <title>From Understanding to Generation: An Efficient Shortcut for Evaluating Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time. We plan to publish our benchmark adaptions.</description>

      <title>Is linguistically-motivated data augmentation worth it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation, a widely-employed technique for addressing data scarcity, involves generating synthetic data examples which are then used to augment available training data. Researchers have seen surprising success from simple methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn't conform to the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies, leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better downstream performance.
  In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness of many different strategies and their combinations across two important sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and interlinear glossing. We find that linguistically-motivated strategies can have benefits over naive approaches, but only when the new examples they produce are not significantly unlike the training data distribution.</description>

      <title>Auto prompt sql: a resource-efficient architecture for text-to-sql translation in constrained environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.</description>

      <title>Learning to Insert [PAUSE] Tokens for Better Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance reasoning capabilities, previous works have explored incorporating special-purpose tokens into the training process. These strategies strengthen the learning mechanism of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). Building on prior research, in which inserting dummy tokens consecutively just before reasoning steps can enhance effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach termed Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT). Our method identifies positions within sequences where model confidence is lowest according to token log-likelihood. Strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens on these positions bolsters the model's predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens. Experimental results across diverse datasets and models, from the 2.7B model to the 8B model, demonstrate that DIT consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With this simple yet effective method, we achieve accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on AQUA-RAT, and pass@1 improvements of up to 3.4%p on MBPP datasets. Our work shows a model-based, dynamic approach rather than a heuristic one, thereby broadening the scope of research in reasoning.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Know Folktales? A Case Study of Yokai in Japanese Folktales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural knowledge is often limited to English-speaking communities, which can marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem, evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today. Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions (each with four options) designed to probe knowledge about yokai. We evaluate the performance of 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset. The results show that models trained with Japanese language resources achieve higher accuracy than English-centric models, with those that underwent continued pretraining in Japanese, particularly those based on Llama-3, performing especially well. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CyberAgentA ILab/YokaiEval.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Prompting: Enhancing Robustness of Large Language Models Against Prompting Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>RewardAnything: Generalizable Principle-Following Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Medical Question Answering: An Evaluation-Centric Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in healthcare question-answering (QA) systems is important for ensuring patient safety, clinical effectiveness, and user confidence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into medical settings, the reliability of their responses directly influences clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. However, achieving comprehensive trustworthiness in medical QA poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of healthcare data, the critical nature of clinical scenarios, and the multifaceted dimensions of trustworthy AI. In this survey, we systematically examine six key dimensions of trustworthiness in medical QA, i.e., Factuality, Robustness, Fairness, Safety, Explainability, and Calibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based medical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess these dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model improvements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning, and safety alignment. Finally, we identify open challenges-such as scalable expert evaluation, integrated multi-dimensional metrics, and real-world deployment studies-and propose future research directions to advance the safe, reliable, and transparent deployment of LLM-powered medical QA.</description>

      <title>ROSA: Addressing text understanding challenges in photographs via ROtated SAmpling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visually impaired people could benefit from Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems to interpret text in their surroundings. However, current models often struggle with recognizing text in the photos taken by this population. Through in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, we identified common framing conventions that frequently result in misaligned text. Existing VQA benchmarks primarily feature well-oriented text captured by sighted users, under-representing these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce ROtated SAmpling (ROSA), a decoding strategy that enhances VQA performance in text-rich images with incorrectly oriented text. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7 absolute points in the best-performing model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Domain Adaptation of ASR Using Pseudo-Labels and Multi-Stage Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging for small organizations with limited labeled data and computational resources. Here, we explore different data selection pipelines and propose a robust approach that improves ASR adaptation by filtering pseudo-labels generated using Whisper (encoder-decoder) and Zipformer (transducer) models. Our approach integrates multiple selection strategies -- including word error rate (WER) prediction, named entity recognition (NER), and character error rate (CER) analysis -- to extract high-quality training segments. We evaluate our method on Whisper and Zipformer using a 7500-hour baseline, comparing it to a CER-based approach relying on hypotheses from three ASR systems. Fine-tuning on 7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves 12.3% WER, while our filtering reduces the dataset to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance; a similar trend is observed on Fisher English.</description>

      <title>Robust Preference Optimization via Dynamic Target Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands. However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose $\gamma$-PO, a dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin calibration, $\gamma$-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from ambiguous pairs. Moreover, $\gamma$-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs. Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, $\gamma$-PO achieves an average 4.4\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, $\gamma$-PO requires minimal code changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust solution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

      <title>AdaDecode: Accelerating LLM Decoding with Adaptive Layer Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities. Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup, while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.</description>

      <title>ScoreRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework with Consistency-Relevance Scoring and Structured Summarization for News Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces ScoreRAG, an approach to enhance the quality of automated news generation. Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing and large language models, current news generation methods often struggle with hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and lack of domain-specific expertise when producing news articles. ScoreRAG addresses these challenges through a multi-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented generation, consistency relevance evaluation, and structured summarization. The system first retrieves relevant news documents from a vector database, maps them to complete news items, and assigns consistency relevance scores based on large language model evaluations. These documents are then reranked according to relevance, with low-quality items filtered out. The framework proceeds to generate graded summaries based on relevance scores, which guide the large language model in producing complete news articles following professional journalistic standards. Through this methodical approach, ScoreRAG aims to significantly improve the accuracy, coherence, informativeness, and professionalism of generated news articles while maintaining stability and consistency throughout the generation process. The code and demo are available at: https://github.com/peiyun2260/ScoreRAG.</description>

      <title>MFLA: Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention for Streaming Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying large pre-trained speech models like Whisper has shown promise in reducing training costs for various speech tasks. However, integrating these models into streaming systems remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel prefix-to-prefix training framework for streaming recognition by fine-tuning the Whisper. We introduce the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire mechanism to establish a quasi-monotonic alignment between continuous speech sequences and discrete text tokens. Additionally, we design Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention, allowing each token to attend to infinite left-context and finite right-context from the speech sequences. We also employ the wait-k decoding strategy to simplify the decoding process while ensuring consistency between training and testing. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves a controllable trade-off between latency and quality, making it suitable for various streaming applications.</description>

      <title>Verbalized Confidence Triggers Self-Verification: Emergent Behavior Without Explicit Reasoning Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.</description>

      <title>Generating Pedagogically Meaningful Visuals for Math Word Problems: A New Benchmark and Analysis of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.</description>

      <title>Act-as-Pet: Benchmarking the Abilities of Large Language Models as E-Pets in Social Network Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for interactive and emotionally rich experiences grows, virtual pet companionship emerges as a novel yet underexplored application. Existing approaches focus on basic pet role-playing interactions without systematically benchmarking LLMs for comprehensive companionship. In this paper, we introduce Pet-Bench, a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs across both self-interaction and human-interaction dimensions. Unlike prior work, Pet-Bench emphasizes self-evolution and developmental behaviors alongside interactive engagement, offering a more realistic reflection of pet companionship. It features diverse tasks such as intelligent scheduling, memory-based dialogues, and psychological conversations, with over 7,500 interaction instances designed to simulate complex pet behaviors. Evaluation of 28 LLMs reveals significant performance variations linked to model size and inherent capabilities, underscoring the need for specialized optimization in this domain. Pet-Bench serves as a foundational resource for benchmarking pet-related LLM abilities and advancing emotionally immersive human-pet interactions.</description>

      <title>AhaKV: Adaptive Holistic Attention-Driven KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>ClozeMath: Improving Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models by Learning to Fill Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been enhanced by training on data that reflects human thought processes, such as the Chain-of-Thought format. However, evidence suggests that the conventional scheme of next-word prediction may not fully capture how humans learn to think. Inspired by how humans generalize mathematical reasoning, we propose a new approach named ClozeMath to fine-tune LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our ClozeMath involves a text-infilling task that predicts masked equations from a given solution, analogous to cloze exercises used in human learning. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and GSM-Symbolic show that ClozeMath surpasses the strong baseline Masked Thought in performance and robustness, with two test-time scaling decoding algorithms, Beam Search and Chain-of-Thought decoding. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of various architectural and implementation choices on our approach.</description>

      <title>Unifying Uniform and Binary-coding Quantization for Accurate Compression of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.</description>

      <title>Knockout LLM Assessment: Using Large Language Models for Evaluations through Iterative Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03785v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.</description>

      <title>Mark My Words: A Robust Multilingual Model for Punctuation in Text and Speech Transcripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punctuation plays a vital role in structuring meaning, yet current models often struggle to restore it accurately in transcripts of spontaneous speech, especially in the presence of disfluencies such as false starts and backtracking. These limitations hinder the performance of downstream tasks like translation, text to speech, summarization, etc. where sentence boundaries are critical for preserving quality. In this work, we introduce Cadence, a generalist punctuation restoration model adapted from a pretrained large language model. Cadence is designed to handle both clean written text and highly spontaneous spoken transcripts. It surpasses the previous state of the art in performance while expanding support from 14 to all 22 Indian languages and English. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of model behavior across punctuation types and language families, identifying persistent challenges under domain shift and with rare punctuation marks. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing pretrained language models for multilingual punctuation restoration and highlight Cadence practical value for low resource NLP pipelines at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hausa texts are often characterized by writing anomalies such as incorrect character substitutions and spacing errors, which sometimes hinder natural language processing (NLP) applications. This paper presents an approach to automatically correct the anomalies by finetuning transformer-based models. Using a corpus gathered from several public sources, we created a large-scale parallel dataset of over 450,000 noisy-clean Hausa sentence pairs by introducing synthetically generated noise, fine-tuned to mimic realistic writing errors. Moreover, we adapted several multilingual and African language-focused models, including M2M100, AfriTEVA, mBART, and Opus-MT variants for this correction task using SentencePiece tokenization. Our experimental results demonstrate significant increases in F1, BLEU and METEOR scores, as well as reductions in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). This research provides a robust methodology, a publicly available dataset, and effective models to improve Hausa text quality, thereby advancing NLP capabilities for the language and offering transferable insights for other low-resource languages.</description>

Starting with a publication's URL, such as a digital object identifier, CRAWLDoc retrieves the landing page and all linked web resources, including PDFs, ORCID profiles, and supplementary materials. It embeds these resources, along with anchor texts and the URLs, into a unified representation. For evaluating CRAWLDoc, we have created a new, manually labeled dataset of 600 publications from six top publishers in computer science. Our method CRAWLDoc demonstrates a robust and layout-independent ranking of relevant documents across publishers and data formats. It lays the foundation for improved metadata extraction from web documents with various layouts and formats. Our source code and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/FKarl/CRAWLDoc.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Aligned Bidword Generation Model for E-commerce Search Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval systems primarily address the challenge of matching user queries with the most relevant advertisements, playing a crucial role in e-commerce search advertising. The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled, ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining, query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of recalled ads.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model (MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art. After deployment, the algorithm has created huge commercial value for the platform, further verifying its feasibility and robustness.</description>

      <title>Brain-tuned Speech Models Better Reflect Speech Processing Stages in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic representations, making them better model organisms for human speech processing.</description>

      <title>PulseReddit: A Novel Reddit Dataset for Benchmarking MAS in High-Frequency Cryptocurrency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is pivotal in cryptocurrency markets, demanding rapid decision-making. Social media platforms like Reddit offer valuable, yet underexplored, information for such high-frequency, short-term trading. This paper introduces \textbf{PulseReddit}, a novel dataset that is the first to align large-scale Reddit discussion data with high-frequency cryptocurrency market statistics for short-term trading analysis. We conduct an extensive empirical study using Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to investigate the impact of social sentiment from PulseReddit on trading performance. Our experiments conclude that MAS augmented with PulseReddit data achieve superior trading outcomes compared to traditional baselines, particularly in bull markets, and demonstrate robust adaptability across different market regimes. Furthermore, our research provides conclusive insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different LLMs, detailing significant considerations for practical model selection in HFT applications. PulseReddit and our findings establish a foundation for advanced MAS research in HFT, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating social media.</description>

      <title>EuroGEST: Investigating gender stereotypes in multilingual language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models increasingly support multiple languages, yet most benchmarks for gender bias remain English-centric. We introduce EuroGEST, a dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in LLMs across English and 29 European languages. EuroGEST builds on an existing expert-informed benchmark covering 16 gender stereotypes, expanded in this work using translation tools, quality estimation metrics, and morphological heuristics. Human evaluations confirm that our data generation method results in high accuracy of both translations and gender labels across languages. We use EuroGEST to evaluate 24 multilingual language models from six model families, demonstrating that the strongest stereotypes in all models across all languages are that women are \textit{beautiful,} \textit{empathetic} and \textit{neat} and men are \textit{leaders}, \textit{strong, tough} and \textit{professional}. We also show that larger models encode gendered stereotypes more strongly and that instruction finetuning does not consistently reduce gendered stereotypes. Our work highlights the need for more multilingual studies of fairness in LLMs and offers scalable methods and resources to audit gender bias across languages.</description>

      <title>RadialRouter: Structured Representation for Efficient and Robust Large Language Models Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.</description>

      <title>Kinship in Speech: Leveraging Linguistic Relatedness for Zero-Shot TTS in Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.</description>

      <title>Pre$^3$: Enabling Deterministic Pushdown Automata for Faster Structured LLM Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations, particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g., JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$ introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments.

      <title>Magic Mushroom: A Customizable Benchmark for Fine-grained Analysis of Retrieval Noise Erosion in RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03901v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such as hallucination and outdated knowledge. However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment. In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios. Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems. Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs. More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups. We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment. Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions. Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications. The Magic Mushroom benchmark is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aP5kyPuk4L-L_uoI6T9UhxuTyt8oMqjT/view?usp=sharing.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Structure of Information Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis proposes that speakers aim to distribute information evenly throughout a text, balancing production effort and listener comprehension difficulty. However, language typically does not maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure, suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization. Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity.</description>

      <title>When Fairness Isn't Statistical: The Limits of Machine Learning in Evaluating Legal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal decisions are increasingly evaluated for fairness, consistency, and bias using machine learning (ML) techniques. In high-stakes domains like refugee adjudication, such methods are often applied to detect disparities in outcomes. Yet it remains unclear whether statistical methods can meaningfully assess fairness in legal contexts shaped by discretion, normative complexity, and limited ground truth.
  In this paper, we empirically evaluate three common ML approaches (feature-based analysis, semantic clustering, and predictive modeling) on a large, real-world dataset of 59,000+ Canadian refugee decisions (AsyLex). Our experiments show that these methods produce divergent and sometimes contradictory signals, that predictive modeling often depends on contextual and procedural features rather than legal features, and that semantic clustering fails to capture substantive legal reasoning.
  We show limitations of statistical fairness evaluation, challenge the assumption that statistical regularity equates to fairness, and argue that current computational approaches fall short of evaluating fairness in legally discretionary domains. We argue that evaluating fairness in law requires methods grounded not only in data, but in legal reasoning and institutional context.</description>

      <title>Compositional Generalisation for Explainable Hate Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech detection is key to online content moderation, but current models struggle to generalise beyond their training data. This has been linked to dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g., "artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison), they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding context. As a result, combinations of expressions that deviate from those seen during training remain particularly difficult for models to detect. We investigate whether training on a dataset where expressions occur with equal frequency across all contexts can improve generalisation. To this end, we create U-PLEAD, a dataset of ~364,000 synthetic posts, along with a novel compositional generalisation benchmark of ~8,000 manually validated posts. Training on a combination of U-PLEAD and real data improves compositional generalisation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the human-sourced PLEAD.</description>

      <title>HSSBench: Benchmarking Humanities and Social Sciences Ability for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.</description>

      <title>More or Less Wrong: A Benchmark for Directional Bias in LLM Comparative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Hanging in the Balance: Pivotal Moments in Crisis Counseling Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling.
  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.</description>

      <title>TableEval: A Real-World Benchmark for Complex, Multilingual, and Multi-Structured Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage. Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents. Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level. Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval.</description>

      <title>From Real to Synthetic: Synthesizing Millions of Diversified and Complicated User Instructions with Attributed Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.</description>

      <title>Structured Pruning for Diverse Best-of-N Reasoning Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model pruning in transformer-based language models, traditionally viewed as a means of achieving computational savings, can enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we uncover a surprising phenomenon: the selective pruning of certain attention heads leads to improvements in reasoning performance, particularly on challenging tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose SPRINT, a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically selects the optimal head and layer to prune during inference. By aligning question embeddings with head embeddings, SPRINT identifies those pruned-head configurations that result in more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional best-of-$N$ and random head selection strategies on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets.</description>

      <title>Voice Activity Projection Model with Multimodal Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turn-taking management is crucial for any social interaction. Still, it is challenging to model human-machine interaction due to the complexity of the social context and its multimodal nature. Unlike conventional systems based on silence duration, previous existing voice activity projection (VAP) models successfully utilized a unified representation of turn-taking behaviors as prediction targets, which improved turn-taking prediction performance. Recently, a multimodal VAP model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model by a significant margin. In this paper, we propose a multimodal model enhanced with pre-trained audio and face encoders to improve performance by capturing subtle expressions. Our model performed competitively, and in some cases, even better than state-of-the-art models on turn-taking metrics. All the source codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/sagatake/VAPwithAudioFaceEncoders.</description>

      <title>Around the World in 24 Hours: Probing LLM Knowledge of Time and Place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning over time and space is essential for understanding our world. However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.</description>

      <title>Stronger Baselines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing tens of thousands of tokens in a single pass, do multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines still offer measurable benefits over simpler, single-stage approaches? To assess this question, we conduct a controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets, comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We recommend establishing DOS RAG as a simple yet strong baseline for future RAG evaluations, pairing it with emerging embedding and language models to assess trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness as model capabilities evolve.</description>

      <title>DynTok: Dynamic Compression of Visual Tokens for Efficient and Effective Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work, we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance. It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves 65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Words of Warmth: Trust and Sociability Norms for over 26k English Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social psychologists have shown that Warmth (W) and Competence (C) are the primary dimensions along which we assess other people and groups. These dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. More recent work has started to explore how these dimensions develop, why they have developed, and what they constitute. Of particular note, is the finding that warmth has two distinct components: Trust (T) and Sociability (S). In this work, we introduce Words of Warmth, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word--warmth (as well as word--trust and word--sociability) associations for over 26k English words. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicons to study the rate at which children acquire WCTS words with age. Finally, we show that the lexicon enables a wide variety of bias and stereotype research through case studies on various target entities.

      <title>Seeing What Tastes Good: Revisiting Multimodal Distributional Semantics in the Billion Parameter Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper, we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity of the modalities.</description>

      <title>QQSUM: A Novel Task and Model of Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization for Review-based Product Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Review-based Product Question Answering (PQA) allows e-commerce platforms to automatically address customer queries by leveraging insights from user reviews. However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization (QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG, employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG baselines in both textual quality and quantification accuracy of opinions.

      <title>AI Agents for Conversational Patient Triage: Preliminary Simulation-Based Evaluation with Real-World EHR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: We present a Patient Simulator that leverages real world patient encounters which cover a broad range of conditions and symptoms to provide synthetic test subjects for development and testing of healthcare agentic models. The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system. Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians. Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a multi-turn conversational AI agent at scale.</description>

      <title>The mutual exclusivity bias of bilingual visually grounded speech models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual exclusivity (ME) is a strategy where a novel word is associated with a novel object rather than a familiar one, facilitating language learning in children. Recent work has found an ME bias in a visually grounded speech (VGS) model trained on English speech with paired images. But ME has also been studied in bilingual children, who may employ it less due to cross-lingual ambiguity. We explore this pattern computationally using bilingual VGS models trained on combinations of English, French, and Dutch. We find that bilingual models generally exhibit a weaker ME bias than monolingual models, though exceptions exist. Analyses show that the combined visual embeddings of bilingual models have a smaller variance for familiar data, partly explaining the increase in confusion between novel and familiar concepts. We also provide new insights into why the ME bias exists in VGS models in the first place. Code and data: https://github.com/danoneata/me-vgs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning in legal texts is important for applications like case law analysis and compliance monitoring. However, existing datasets lack expert language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512 instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge. We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Eliminating the Shortcut Learning for Locate-Then-Edit Knowledge Editing via Both Subject and Relation Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to alternate the target knowledge predicted by large language models while ensuring the least side effects on unrelated knowledge. An effective way to achieve knowledge editing is to identify pivotal parameters for predicting factual associations and modify them with an optimization process to update the predictions. However, these locate-then-edit methods are uncontrollable since they tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to the subject of target editing. We unveil that this failure of controllable editing is due to a shortcut learning issue during the optimization process. Specifically, we discover two crucial features that are the subject feature and the relation feature for models to learn during optimization, but the current optimization process tends to over-learning the subject feature while neglecting the relation feature. To eliminate this shortcut learning of the subject feature, we propose a novel two-stage optimization process that balances the learning of the subject feature and the relation feature. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully prevents knowledge editing from shortcut learning and achieves the optimal overall performance, contributing to controllable knowledge editing.</description>

      <title>Think Like a Person Before Responding: A Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Persona-Guided LLMs for Countering Hate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini, Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding safety and effectiveness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes LIBU (LoRA enhanced influence-based unlearning), an algorithm to solve the task of unlearning - removing specific knowledge from a large language model without retraining from scratch and compromising its overall utility (SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning sensitive content from Large Language Models). The algorithm combines classical \textit{influence functions} to remove the influence of the data from the model and \textit{second-order optimization} to stabilize the overall utility. Our experiments show that this lightweight approach is well applicable for unlearning LLMs in different kinds of task.</description>

      <title>On Support Samples of Next Word Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models excel in various tasks by making complex decisions, yet understanding the rationale behind these decisions remains a challenge. This paper investigates \emph{data-centric interpretability} in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of \emph{support samples}-those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Explainability-Based Token Replacement on LLM-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.</description>

      <title>High Accuracy, Less Talk (HALT): Reliable LLMs through Capability-Aligned Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.</description>

      <title>Progressive Mastery: Customized Curriculum Learning with Guided Prompting for Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, yet post-training is constrained by inefficient sample utilization and inflexible difficulty samples processing. To address these limitations, we propose Customized Curriculum Learning (CCL), a novel framework with two key innovations. First, we introduce model-adaptive difficulty definition that customizes curriculum datasets based on each model's individual capabilities rather than using predefined difficulty metrics. Second, we develop "Guided Prompting," which dynamically reduces sample difficulty through strategic hints, enabling effective utilization of challenging samples that would otherwise degrade performance. Comprehensive experiments on supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CCL significantly outperforms uniform training approaches across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness across both paradigms in enhancing sample utilization and model performance.</description>

      <title>LaF-GRPO: In-Situ Navigation Instruction Generation for the Visually Impaired via GRPO with LLM-as-Follower Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions. Code and benchmark are available at \href{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}.</description>

      <title>Controlling Difficulty of Generated Text for AI-Assisted Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practicing conversations with large language models (LLMs) presents a promising alternative to traditional in-person language learning. However, most LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited for beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether controllable generation techniques -- specifically modular methods that do not require model fine-tuning -- can adapt LLM outputs to better support absolute beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while prompting alone fails to control output difficulty, the use of future discriminators (Yang and Klein, 2021) significantly improves output comprehensibility (from 40.4\% to 84.3\%). We further introduce a novel token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.</description>

      <title>Acoustically Precise Hesitation Tagging Is Essential for End-to-End Verbatim Transcription Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak &amp; Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme (6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.</description>

      <title>A Novel Data Augmentation Approach for Automatic Speaking Assessment on Opinion Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.</description>

      <title>LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.</description>

Abstract: This report presents EuroLLM-9B, a large language model trained from scratch to support the needs of European citizens by covering all 24 official European Union languages and 11 additional languages. EuroLLM addresses the issue of European languages being underrepresented and underserved in existing open large language models. We provide a comprehensive overview of EuroLLM-9B's development, including tokenizer design, architectural specifications, data filtering, and training procedures. We describe the pre-training data collection and filtering pipeline, including the creation of EuroFilter, an AI-based multilingual filter, as well as the design of EuroBlocks-Synthetic, a novel synthetic dataset for post-training that enhances language coverage for European languages. Evaluation results demonstrate EuroLLM-9B's competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks and machine translation tasks, establishing it as the leading open European-made LLM of its size. To support open research and adoption, we release all major components of this work, including the base and instruction-tuned models, the EuroFilter classifier, and the synthetic post-training dataset.</description>

      <title>TextAtari: 100K Frames Game Playing with Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.</description>

      <title>Rectified Sparse Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04108v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient long-sequence generation is a critical challenge for Large Language Models. While recent sparse decoding methods improve efficiency, they suffer from KV cache misalignment, where approximation errors accumulate and degrade generation quality. In this work, we propose Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA), a simple yet effective method that combines block-sparse attention with periodic dense rectification. By refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals using a dense forward pass, ReSA bounds error accumulation and preserves alignment with the pretraining distribution. Experiments across math reasoning, language modeling, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that ReSA achieves near-lossless generation quality with significantly improved efficiency. Notably, ReSA delivers up to 2.42$\times$ end-to-end speedup under decoding at 256K sequence length, making it a practical solution for scalable long-context inference. Code is available at https://aka.ms/ReSA-LM.</description>

      <title>CLAIM: An Intent-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Analyzing Manipulation in Courtroom Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage, Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Disha1001/CLAIM.</description>

      <title>Are Lexicon-Based Tools Still the Gold Standard for Valence Analysis in Low-Resource Flemish?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nuances in everyday language is pivotal for advancements in computational linguistics &amp; emotions research. Traditional lexicon-based tools such as LIWC and Pattern have long served as foundational instruments in this domain. LIWC is the most extensively validated word count based text analysis tool in the social sciences and Pattern is an open source Python library offering functionalities for NLP. However, everyday language is inherently spontaneous, richly expressive, &amp; deeply context dependent. To explore the capabilities of LLMs in capturing the valences of daily narratives in Flemish, we first conducted a study involving approximately 25,000 textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants. Each participant provided narratives prompted by the question, "What is happening right now and how do you feel about it?", accompanied by self-assessed valence ratings on a continuous scale from -50 to +50. We then assessed the performance of three Dutch-specific LLMs in predicting these valence scores, and compared their outputs to those generated by LIWC and Pattern. Our findings indicate that, despite advancements in LLM architectures, these Dutch tuned models currently fall short in accurately capturing the emotional valence present in spontaneous, real-world narratives. This study underscores the imperative for developing culturally and linguistically tailored models/tools that can adeptly handle the complexities of natural language use. Enhancing automated valence analysis is not only pivotal for advancing computational methodologies but also holds significant promise for psychological research with ecologically valid insights into human daily experiences. We advocate for increased efforts in creating comprehensive datasets &amp; finetuning LLMs for low-resource languages like Flemish, aiming to bridge the gap between computational linguistics &amp; emotion research.</description>

      <title>Establishing Trustworthy LLM Evaluation via Shortcut Neuron Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings.

      <title>A Dataset for Addressing Patient's Information Needs related to Clinical Course of Hospitalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs). While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>SkipGPT: Dynamic Layer Pruning Reinvented with Token Awareness and Module Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but incur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered architectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these inefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical dynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level heterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical dynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers necessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a dynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource allocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to prioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and self-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a two-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that learns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning decisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore performance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the performance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing dynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical deployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT.</description>

      <title>SuperWriter: Reflection-Driven Long-Form Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.</description>

      <title>Long or short CoT? Investigating Instance-level Switch of Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large reasoning models, long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks. However, this often comes with a significant increase in token usage. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing long and short CoT strategies. Our findings reveal that while long CoT can lead to performance improvements, its benefits are often marginal relative to its significantly higher token consumption. Specifically, long CoT tends to outperform when ample generation budgets are available, whereas short CoT is more effective under tighter budget constraints. These insights underscore the need for a dynamic approach that selects the proper CoT strategy based on task context and resource availability. To address this, we propose SwitchCoT, an automatic framework that adaptively chooses between long and short CoT strategies to balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, SwitchCoT is designed to be budget-aware, making it broadly applicable across scenarios with varying resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchCoT can reduce inference costs by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy. Notably, under limited token budgets, it achieves performance comparable to, or even exceeding, that of using either long or short CoT alone.</description>

      <title>R-Search: Empowering LLM Reasoning with Search via Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and long-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training, R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1% (out-of-domain). The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/R-Search.</description>

      <title>Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.</description>

      <title>mRAG: Elucidating the Design Space of Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Infinity Parser: Layout Aware Reinforcement Learning for Scanned Document Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.</description>

      <title>DiaBlo: Diagonal Blocks Are Sufficient For Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finetuning is a critical step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific downstream tasks. To mitigate the substantial computational and memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters. However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DiaBlo. Across these benchmarks, DiaBlo demonstrates strong and consistent performance while maintaining high memory efficiency and fast finetuning speed. Codes are available at https://github.com/ziyangjoy/DiaBlo.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Task Vectors for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few demonstrations provided in the prompt. Despite its success, ICL suffers from several limitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length constraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task vector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector. However, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of demonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the specific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective adaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying demonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors (ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors conditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate task vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture and applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous vector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their corresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each specific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong performance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is expressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive than Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational advantage.</description>

      <title>Exploiting LLMs for Automatic Hypothesis Assessment via a Logit-Based Calibrated Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention. In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation: automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming deeper scientific or causal hypotheses.
  To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of 78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of 89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.</description>

      <title>ProRank: Prompt Warmup via Reinforcement Learning for Small Language Models Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reranking is fundamental to information retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation, with recent Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advancing reranking quality. While recent advances with LLMs have significantly improved document reranking quality, current approaches primarily rely on large-scale LLMs (&gt;7B parameters) through zero-shot prompting, presenting high computational costs. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising alternative because of their efficiency, but our preliminary quantitative analysis reveals they struggle with understanding task prompts without fine-tuning. This limits their effectiveness for document reranking tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage training approach, ProRank, for SLM-based document reranking. First, we propose a prompt warmup stage using reinforcement learning GRPO to steer SLMs to understand task prompts and generate more accurate coarse-grained binary relevance scores for document reranking. Then, we continuously fine-tune the SLMs with a fine-grained score learning stage without introducing additional layers to further improve the reranking quality. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ProRank consistently outperforms both the most advanced open-source and proprietary reranking models. Notably, our lightweight ProRank-0.5B model even surpasses the powerful 32B LLM reranking model on the BEIR benchmark, establishing that properly trained SLMs can achieve superior document reranking performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Video-Skill-CoT: Skill-based Chain-of-Thoughts for Domain-Adaptive Video Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scholarly literature makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to keep up with new knowledge. Automated tools are now more essential than ever to help navigate and interpret this vast body of information. Scientific papers pose unique difficulties, with their complex language, specialized terminology, and diverse formats, requiring advanced methods to extract reliable and actionable insights. Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities, enabling tasks such as literature reviews, writing assistance, and interactive exploration of research. This special issue of the TAL journal highlights research addressing these challenges and, more broadly, research on natural language processing and information retrieval for scholarly and scientific documents.</description>

      <title>BiMa: Towards Biases Mitigation for Text-Video Retrieval via Scene Element Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Tone recognition in low-resource languages of North-East India: peeling the layers of SSL-based speech models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami, Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition, regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

      <title>VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks.

      <title>PromptCanvas: Composable Prompting Workspaces Using Dynamic Widgets for Exploration and Iteration in Creative Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PromptCanvas, a concept that transforms prompting into a composable, widget-based experience on an infinite canvas. Users can generate, customize, and arrange interactive widgets representing various facets of their text, offering greater control over AI-generated content. PromptCanvas allows widget creation through system suggestions, user prompts, or manual input, providing a flexible environment tailored to individual needs. This enables deeper engagement with the creative process. In a lab study with 18 participants, PromptCanvas outperformed a traditional conversational UI on the Creativity Support Index. Participants found that it reduced cognitive load, with lower mental demand and frustration. Qualitative feedback revealed that the visual organization of thoughts and easy iteration encouraged new perspectives and ideas. A follow-up field study (N=10) confirmed these results, showcasing the potential of dynamic, customizable interfaces in improving collaborative writing with AI.</description>

      <title>Prompt Candidates, then Distill: A Teacher-Student Framework for LLM-driven Data Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.</description>

      <title>VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</description>

      <title>Graph Counselor: Adaptive Graph Exploration via Multi-Agent Synergy to Enhance LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/gjq100/Graph-Counselor.git.</description>

      <title>AgentMisalignment: Measuring the Propensity for Misaligned Behaviour in LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.</description>

      <title>CETBench: A Novel Dataset constructed via Transformations over Programs for Benchmarking LLMs for Code-Equivalence Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Entity-Centric Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Tabular Reasoning with Privileged Structured Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>AmbiK: Dataset of Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks.

      <title>MMR-V: What's Left Unsaid? A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame. (2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only 52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies (Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains. We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multimodal Reasoning: From Optimized Cold Start to Staged Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.</description>

      <title>Does Thinking More always Help? Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.</description>

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in the field of natural language processing has sparked the interest of the speech-processing community, leading to an exploration of their potential for modeling long-range dependencies within speech sequences. Recently, transformers have gained prominence across various speech-related domains, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, speech para-linguistics, speech enhancement, spoken dialogue systems, and numerous multimodal applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that aims to bridge research studies from diverse subfields within speech technology. By consolidating findings from across the speech technology landscape, we provide a valuable resource for researchers interested in harnessing the power of transformers to advance the field. We identify the challenges encountered by transformers in speech processing while also offering insights into potential solutions to address these issues.</description>

      <title>WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

      <title>Concept-Guided Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Pairwise Comparison Scoring of Texts with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing text scoring methods require a large corpus, struggle with short texts, or require hand-labeled data. We develop a text scoring framework that leverages generative large language models (LLMs) to (1) set texts against the backdrop of information from the near-totality of the web and digitized media, and (2) effectively transform pairwise text comparisons from a reasoning problem to a pattern recognition task. Our approach, concept-guided chain-of-thought (CGCoT), utilizes a chain of researcher-designed prompts with an LLM to generate a concept-specific breakdown for each text, akin to guidance provided to human coders. We then pairwise compare breakdowns using an LLM and aggregate answers into a score using a probability model. We apply this approach to better understand speech reflecting aversion to specific political parties on Twitter, a topic that has commanded increasing interest because of its potential contributions to democratic backsliding. We achieve stronger correlations with human judgments than widely used unsupervised text scoring methods like Wordfish. In a supervised setting, besides a small pilot dataset to develop CGCoT prompts, our measures require no additional hand-labeled data and produce predictions on par with RoBERTa-Large fine-tuned on thousands of hand-labeled tweets. This project showcases the potential of combining human expertise and LLMs for scoring tasks.</description>

      <title>CheckEmbed: Effective Verification of LLM Solutions to Open-Ended Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.</description>

      <title>AlignMMBench: Evaluating Chinese Multimodal Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the alignment capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is essential for determining their effectiveness as helpful assistants. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, which provides more nuanced evaluations of alignment capabilities and is the first benchmark specifically designed for Chinese visual contexts. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we develop CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4's evaluation ability. Additionally, we measure the "alignment score", a quantitative metric designed to assess the robustness and stability of models across diverse prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of representative VLMs on AlignMMBench, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of different VLM architectures. The evaluation code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/AlignMMBench.</description>

      <title>UBench: Benchmarking Uncertainty in Large Language Models with Multiple Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in systematic evaluation frameworks, benchmarking the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) remains a highly challenging task. Existing methods for benchmarking the uncertainty of LLMs face three key challenges: the need for internal model access, additional training, or high computational costs. This is particularly unfavorable for closed-source models. To this end, we introduce UBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the uncertainty of LLMs. Unlike other benchmarks, UBench is based on confidence intervals. It encompasses 11,978 multiple-choice questions spanning knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Based on this, we conduct extensive experiments. This includes comparisons with other advanced uncertainty estimation methods, the assessment of the uncertainty of 20 LLMs, and an exploration of the effects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, role-playing (RP) prompts, and temperature on model uncertainty. Our analysis reveals several crucial insights: 1) Our confidence interval-based methods are highly effective for uncertainty quantification; 2) Regarding uncertainty, outstanding open-source models show competitive performance versus closed-source models; 3) CoT and RP prompts present potential ways to improve model reliability, while the influence of temperature changes follows no universal rule. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Cyno2232/UBENCH.</description>

      <title>UIO-LLMs: Unbiased Incremental Optimization for Long-Context LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.</description>

      <title>REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.</description>

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

      <title>Nudging: Inference-time Alignment of LLMs via Guided Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

      <title>LoGU: Long-form Generation with Uncertainty Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14309v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.</description>

      <title>RULEBREAKERS: Challenging LLMs at the Crossroads between Formal Logic and Human-like Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.</description>

      <title>DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases.

      <title>Generative Emotion Cause Explanation in Multimodal Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.</description>

      <title>Enabling LLM Knowledge Analysis via Extensive Materialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&amp;Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs).
  As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org</description>

      <title>Improving Radiology Report Conciseness and Structure via Local Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiology reports are often lengthy and unstructured, posing challenges for referring physicians to quickly identify critical imaging findings while increasing the risk of missed information. This retrospective study aimed to enhance radiology reports by making them concise and well-structured, with findings organized by relevant organs. To achieve this, we utilized private large language models (LLMs) deployed locally within our institution's firewall, ensuring data security and minimizing computational costs. Using a dataset of 814 radiology reports from seven board-certified body radiologists at Moffitt Cancer Center, we tested five prompting strategies within the LangChain framework. After evaluating several models, the Mixtral LLM demonstrated superior adherence to formatting requirements compared to alternatives like Llama. The optimal strategy involved condensing reports first and then applying structured formatting based on specific instructions, reducing verbosity while improving clarity. Across all radiologists and reports, the Mixtral LLM reduced redundant word counts by more than 53%. These findings highlight the potential of locally deployed, open-source LLMs to streamline radiology reporting. By generating concise, well-structured reports, these models enhance information retrieval and better meet the needs of referring physicians, ultimately improving clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Safety Bundle: Auditing the Helpful and Harmless Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to mitigate the harms of large language models (LLMs), learning from human feedback (LHF) has been used to steer LLMs towards outputs that are intended to be both less harmful and more helpful. Despite the widespread adoption of LHF in practice, the quality of this feedback and its effectiveness as a safety mitigation technique remain unclear. This study addresses these issues by auditing the widely-used Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset by Anthropic. Our work includes: (1) a thorough investigation of the dataset's content through both manual and automated evaluation; (2) experiments demonstrating the dataset's impact on models' safety; and (3) an analysis of the 100 most influential papers citing this dataset. Through our audit, we showcase how conceptualization failures and quality issues identified in the HH dataset can create additional harms by leading to disparate safety behaviors across demographic groups. Our findings highlight the need for more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to safety mitigation in LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Event Causality Identification: Taxonomy, Challenges, Assessment, and Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.</description>

      <title>MAmmoTH-VL: Eliciting Multimodal Reasoning with Instruction Tuning at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce "Data Laundering," a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75\% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about evaluation integrity in AI development and the need for benchmarks that more accurately reflect true model capabilities.

      <title>Verbosity-Aware Rationale Reduction: Effective Reduction of Redundant Rationale via Principled Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While this approach has proven effective, it inevitably increases substantial inference costs. Previous methods adopting token-level reduction without clear criteria result in poor performance compared to models trained with complete rationale. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction framework leveraging likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches, our method leverages verbosity to selectively remove redundant reasoning sentences while preserving reasoning capabilities. Our experimental results across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method improves performance by an average of 7.71% while reducing token generation by 19.87% compared to model trained with complete reasoning paths.</description>

      <title>ConSim: Measuring Concept-Based Explanations' Effectiveness with Automated Simulatability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations work by mapping complex model computations to human-understandable concepts. Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive empirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent rankings of explanation methods.

      <title>Through the Prism of Culture: Evaluating LLMs' Understanding of Indian Subcultures and Traditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.</description>

      <title>ReFoRCE: A Text-to-SQL Agent with Self-Refinement, Consensus Enforcement, and Column Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.</description>

      <title>Refining Sentence Embedding Model through Ranking Sentences Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sentence embedding is essential for many NLP tasks, with contrastive learning methods achieving strong performance using annotated datasets like NLI. Yet, the reliance on manual labels limits scalability. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sentence pairs, reducing annotation dependency. However, they overlook ranking information crucial for fine-grained semantic distinctions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for controlling the generation direction of LLMs in the latent space. Unlike unconstrained generation, the controlled approach ensures meaningful semantic divergence. Then, we refine exist sentence embedding model by integrating ranking information and semantic information. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new SOTA performance with a modest cost in ranking sentence synthesis.</description>

      <title>Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</description>

      <title>Dehumanizing Machines: Mitigating Anthropomorphic Behaviors in Text Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As text generation systems' outputs are increasingly anthropomorphic -- perceived as human-like -- scholars have also increasingly raised concerns about how such outputs can lead to harmful outcomes, such as users over-relying or developing emotional dependence on these systems. How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Struggle to Describe the Haystack without Human Help: Human-in-the-loop Evaluation of Topic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with a shift from using traditional topic models to Large Language Models. Yet the effectiveness of using LLM for large corpus understanding in real-world applications remains under-explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory approaches or traditional topic models on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to the LLM generation process improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and over-genericity but requires greater human effort. In contrast, traditional. models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly. We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack of large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and face scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints.</description>

      <title>Social Genome: Grounded Social Reasoning Abilities of Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social reasoning abilities are crucial for AI systems to effectively interpret and respond to multimodal human communication and interaction within social contexts. We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.</description>

      <title>D2S-FLOW: Automated Parameter Extraction from Datasheets for SPICE Model Generation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electronic design, engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing SPICE models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an automated framework called D2S-FLOW that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract electrical parameters from datasheets and generate SPICE models with high precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. Unlike traditional RAG systems, D2S-FLOW employs a workflow to enhance precision in handling unstructured documents and inconsistent naming conventions through three innovative mechanisms: Attention-Guided Document Focusing (AGDF), Hierarchical Document-Enhanced Retrieval (HDER), and Heterogeneous Named Entity Normalization (HNEN). AGDF narrows retrieval to user-selected documents, HDER utilizes document structure for precise parameter localization, and HNEN standardizes terminology via semantic inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves an Exact Match (EM) of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.92, and an Exact Correctness (EC) of 0.96, outperforming the strongest baseline by 19.4%, 5.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. Additionally, it reduces API token consumption by 38% and minimizes the irrelevant information ratio to 4%, showcasing substantial improvements in resource efficiency. This research provides an effective automated solution for circuit design.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Attention Training for Efficient Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity concerning sequence length remains a significant bottleneck for processing long documents. As a result, many efforts like sparse attention and state space models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of LLMs over long sequences. Though effective, these approaches compromise the performance or introduce structural complexity. This calls for a simple yet efficient model that preserves the fundamental Transformer architecture. To this end, we introduce SWAT, which enables efficient long-context handling via Sliding Window Attention Training. This paper first attributes the inefficiency of Transformers to the attention sink phenomenon resulting from the high variance of softmax operation. Then, we replace softmax with the sigmoid function and utilize a balanced ALiBi and Rotary Position Embedding for efficient information compression and retention. Experiments demonstrate that SWAT achieves SOTA performance compared with state-of-the-art linear recurrent architectures on eight benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Fzkuji/swat-attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Africa's rich linguistic heritage remains underrepresented in NLP, largely due to historical policies that favor foreign languages and create significant data inequities. In this paper, we integrate theoretical insights on Africa's language landscape with an empirical evaluation using Sahara - a comprehensive benchmark curated from large-scale, publicly accessible datasets capturing the continent's linguistic diversity. By systematically assessing the performance of leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how policy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across African languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform reasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse data. Leveraging these insights, we offer actionable recommendations for policy reforms and inclusive data practices. Overall, our work underscores the urgent need for a dual approach - combining theoretical understanding with empirical evaluation - to foster linguistic diversity in AI for African communities.</description>

      <title>DOVE: A Large-Scale Multi-Dimensional Predictions Dataset Towards Meaningful LLM Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work found that LLMs are sensitive to a wide range of arbitrary prompt dimensions, including the type of delimiters, answer enumerators, instruction wording, and more. This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.

      <title>On the Acquisition of Shared Grammatical Representations in Bilingual Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crosslingual transfer is crucial to contemporary language models' multilingual capabilities, but how it occurs is not well understood. We ask what happens to a monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual models for which we control the amount of data for each language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural priming, a method used to study grammatical representations in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual structural priming results and find that after controlling for training data quantity and language exposure, there are asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human structural priming effects. We also find that structural priming effects are less robust for less similar language pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual transfer learning and shared representations for typologically diverse languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue modeling poses challenges beyond text-based language modeling, requiring real-time interaction, turn-taking, and backchanneling. While most Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) operate in half-duplex mode-processing one turn at a time - emerging full-duplex SDMs can listen and speak simultaneously, enabling more natural conversations. However, current evaluations remain limited, focusing mainly on turn-based metrics or coarse corpus-level analyses. To address this, we introduce Full-Duplex-Bench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates key interactive behaviors: pause handling, backchanneling, turn-taking, and interruption management. Our framework uses automatic metrics for consistent, reproducible assessment and provides a fair, fast evaluation setup. By releasing our benchmark and code, we aim to advance spoken dialogue modeling and foster the development of more natural and engaging SDMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial.</description>

      <title>LSC-Eval: A General Framework to Evaluate Methods for Assessing Dimensions of Lexical Semantic Change Using LLM-Generated Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) provides insight into cultural and social dynamics. Yet, the validity of methods for measuring different kinds of LSC remains unestablished due to the absence of historical benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we propose LSC-Eval, a novel three-stage general-purpose evaluation framework to: (1) develop a scalable methodology for generating synthetic datasets that simulate theory-driven LSC using In-Context Learning and a lexical database; (2) use these datasets to evaluate the sensitivity of computational methods to synthetic change; and (3) assess their suitability for detecting change in specific dimensions and domains. We apply LSC-Eval to simulate changes along the Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth (SIB) dimensions, as defined in the SIBling framework, using examples from psychology. We then evaluate the ability of selected methods to detect these controlled interventions. Our findings validate the use of synthetic benchmarks, demonstrate that tailored methods effectively detect changes along SIB dimensions, and reveal that a state-of-the-art LSC model faces challenges in detecting affective dimensions of LSC. LSC-Eval offers a valuable tool for dimension- and domain-specific benchmarking of LSC methods, with particular relevance to the social sciences.</description>

Abstract: Training state-of-the-art large language models requires vast amounts of clean and diverse textual data. However, building suitable multilingual datasets remains a challenge. In this work, we present HPLT v2, a collection of high-quality multilingual monolingual and parallel corpora, extending prior work of the HPLT project. The monolingual portion of the data contains 8T tokens covering 193 languages, while the parallel data contains 380M sentence pairs covering 51 languages. We document the entire data pipeline and release the code to reproduce it. We provide extensive analysis of the quality and characteristics of our data. Finally, we evaluate the performance of language models and machine translation systems trained on HPLT v2, demonstrating its value.</description>

      <title>Probing LLMs for Multilingual Discourse Generalization Through a Unified Label Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Idiomatic expressions present a unique challenge in NLP, as their meanings are often not directly inferable from their constituent words. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Calibration in Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and transportation. However, their reliability is a major concern, as they often produce plausible but incorrect responses. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.</description>

      <title>SCORE: Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement for AI Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate creative and engaging narratives from user-specified input, but maintaining coherence and emotional depth throughout these AI-generated stories remains a challenge. In this work, we propose SCORE, a framework for Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement, designed to detect and resolve narrative inconsistencies. By tracking key item statuses and generating episode summaries, SCORE uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, incorporating TF-IDF and cosine similarity to identify related episodes and enhance the overall story structure. Results from testing multiple LLM-generated stories demonstrate that SCORE significantly improves the consistency and stability of narrative coherence compared to baseline GPT models, providing a more robust method for evaluating and refining AI-generated narratives.</description>

      <title>Rubrik's Cube: Testing a New Rubric for Evaluating Explanations on the CUBE dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance and usability of Large-Language Models (LLMs) are driving their use in explanation generation tasks. However, despite their widespread adoption, LLM explanations have been found to be unreliable, making it difficult for users to distinguish good from bad explanations. To address this issue, we present Rubrik's CUBE, an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of 26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both humans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two reasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to effectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations are influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems primarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than cohesion and word choice. The full dataset, rubric, and code are available at https://github.com/RubriksCube/rubriks_cube.</description>

      <title>Token-Driven GammaTune: Adaptive Calibration for Enhanced Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>CARE: Assessing the Impact of Multilingual Human Preference Learning on Cultural Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are typically tuned with human preferences to produce helpful responses, but the impact of preference tuning on the ability to handle culturally diverse queries remains understudied. In this paper, we systematically analyze how native human cultural preferences can be incorporated into the preference learning process to train more culturally aware LMs. We introduce \textbf{CARE}, a multilingual resource containing 3,490 culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses with native judgments. We demonstrate how a modest amount of high-quality native preferences improves cultural awareness across various LMs, outperforming larger generic preference data. Our analyses reveal that models with stronger initial cultural performance benefit more from alignment, leading to gaps among models developed in different regions with varying access to culturally relevant data. CARE will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Guochry/CARE.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Short Answer Grading with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.</description>

      <title>Identifying Aspects in Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process. This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review. While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community. This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized. Existing approaches often derive aspects from review forms and guidelines, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are underexplored. To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving aspects from a corpus of peer reviews. We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis. We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Uncertainty Quantification Evaluation in Language Models: Spurious Interactions with Response Length Bias Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is key to improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases--when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors--systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets x 4 models x 8 UQ methods. Our analysis shows that length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LM-as-a-judge methods as the least length-biased, offering a promising path for a fairer UQ evaluation.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Documents or Knowledge Leakage? Rethinking LLM-based Query Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods.</description>

      <title>Meta-rater: A Multi-dimensional Data Selection Method for Pre-training Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability. To advance future research, we release scripts, data, and models at https://github.com/opendatalab/Meta-rater.</description>

      <title>Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.</description>

      <title>T$^2$: An Adaptive Test-Time Scaling Strategy for Contextual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.</description>

      <title>Assistant-Guided Mitigation of Teacher Preference Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Liuz233/AGDe-Judge.</description>

      <title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>

      <title>STEER-BENCH: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Steerability of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of 81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65% accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.</description>

      <title>Trans-EnV: A Framework for Evaluating the Linguistic Robustness of LLMs Against English Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.</description>

      <title>LLMs Think, But Not In Your Flow: Reasoning-Level Personalization for Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.</description>

      <title>DyePack: Provably Flagging Test Set Contamination in LLMs Using Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.</description>

      <title>The Arabic AI Fingerprint: Stylometric Analysis and Detection of Large Language Models Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for information integrity across critical domains, including education, social media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns, compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies (generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement) across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic, and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs, with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\% F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.</description>

      <title>LayerIF: Estimating Layer Quality for Large Language Models using Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.</description>

      <title>Bench4KE: Benchmarking Automated Competency Question Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation, a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limited diversity and inefficient search. We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search. Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.</description>

      <title>MultiHoax: A Dataset of Multi-hop False-Premise Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</description>

      <title>ARIA: Training Language Agents with Intention-Driven Reward Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war between idiom's figurative and literal meanings in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.</description>

      <title>Model Internal Sleuthing: Finding Lexical Identity and Inflectional Morphology in Modern Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably, these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining.

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation. In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction.

      <title>Should LLM Safety Be More Than Refusing Harmful Instructions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.</description>

      <title>CoRe-MMRAG: Cross-Source Knowledge Reconciliation for Multimodal RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</description>

      <title>MASTER: Enhancing Large Language Model via Multi-Agent Simulated Teaching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models' instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However, obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization. Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>On Entity Identification in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models (LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to 0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers. Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally organize and use entity information.</description>

      <title>Critique-GRPO: Advancing LLM Reasoning with Natural Language and Numerical Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.</description>

      <title>Trust-Oriented Adaptive Guardrails for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.</description>

      <title>VinePPO: Refining Credit Assignment in RL Training of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks that require executing several complex steps before receiving any reward. Properly assigning credit to these steps is essential for enhancing model performance. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used for LLM finetuning, employs value networks to tackle credit assignment. However, recent approaches achieve strong results without it, raising questions about the efficacy of value networks in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of value networks and reveal their significant shortcomings in reasoning-heavy LLM tasks, showing that they often produce poor estimate of expected return and barely outperform a random baseline when comparing alternative steps. This motivates our key question: Can improved credit assignment enhance RL training for LLMs? To address this, we propose VinePPO, a straightforward approach that leverages the flexibility of language environments to compute unbiased Monte Carlo-based estimates. Our method consistently outperforms PPO and other baselines across MATH and GSM8K datasets in less wall-clock time (up to 3.0x). Crucially, it achieves higher test accuracy for a given training accuracy, capturing more generalization signal per sample. These results emphasize the importance of accurate credit assignment in RL training of LLM.</description>

      <title>A LLM-Powered Automatic Grading Framework with Human-Level Guidelines Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.</description>

      <title>MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.</description>

      <title>From Intention To Implementation: Automating Biomedical Research via LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols, on average, outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Floating Point Quantization Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training is considered an effective strategy for reducing both training and downstream inference costs. Previous scaling laws for precision mainly focus on integer quantization, which pay less attention to the constituents in floating-point (FP) quantization, and thus cannot well fit the LLM losses in this scenario. In contrast, while FP quantization training is more commonly implemented in production, it's research has been relatively superficial. In this paper, we thoroughly explore the effects of FP quantization targets, exponent bits, mantissa bits, and the calculation granularity of the scaling factor in FP quantization training performance of LLM models. In addition to an accurate FP quantization unified scaling law, we also provide valuable suggestions for the community: (1) Exponent bits contribute slightly more to the model performance than mantissa bits. We provide the optimal exponent-mantissa bit ratio for different bit numbers, which is available for future reference by hardware manufacturers; (2) We discover the formation of the critical data size in low-precision LLM training. Too much training data exceeding the critical data size will inversely bring in degradation of LLM performance; (3) The optimal FP quantization precision is directly proportional to the computational power, but within a wide computational power range. We estimate that the best cost-performance precision should lie between 4-8 bits.</description>

      <title>Sleepless Nights, Sugary Days: Creating Synthetic Users with Health Conditions for Realistic Coaching Agent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.</description>

      <title>InSerter: Speech Instruction Following with Unsupervised Interleaved Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</description>

      <title>ROGRAG: A Robustly Optimized GraphRAG Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly struggle with specialized or emerging topics which are rarely seen in the training corpus. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. It is also challenging to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness due to the overlap between the pretraining and evaluation datasets. In this work, we introduce ROGRAG, a Robustly Optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage retrieval mechanism that integrates dual-level with logic form retrieval methods to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. To further refine the system, we incorporate various result verification methods and adopt an incremental database construction approach. Through extensive ablation experiments, we rigorously assess the effectiveness of each component. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on SeedBench, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. ROGRAG significantly improves the score from 60.0% to 75.0% and outperforms mainstream methods. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic form retrieval improves structured reasoning, highlighting the importance of multi-stage retrieval.ROGRAG is released as an open-source resource and supports installation with pip.</description>

      <title>GRU: Mitigating the Trade-off between Unlearning and Retention for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. It motivates this paper to explore enhanced unlearning schemes that can mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an improved framework that regulates the directions of gradient updates during the unlearning procedure such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. GRU is easy and general to implement, demonstrating practical effectiveness across a variety of well-established unlearning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SAEBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Sparse Autoencoders in Language Model Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench</description>

      <title>A Survey on (M)LLM-Based GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Role of Prompting Strategies in LLM Test-Time Scaling: A Perspective of Probability Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

      <title>PAST: Phonetic-Acoustic Speech Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/PAST</description>

      <title>LLaDA-V: Large Language Diffusion Models with Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

      <title>SynLogic: Synthesizing Verifiable Reasoning Data at Scale for Learning Logical Reasoning and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.</description>

      <title>What LLMs Miss in Recommendations: Bridging the Gap with Retrieval-Augmented Collaborative Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.</description>

      <title>On-Policy RL with Optimal Reward Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO integrates a practically feasible formulation of the optimal reward baseline that minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is merged into the verl library at https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algo/opo.html.</description>

      <title>Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Locally Linear Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.</description>

      <title>ClinBench-HPB: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at https://clinbench-hpb.github.io.</description>

      <title>Children's Voice Privacy: First Steps And Emerging Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00100</link>

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies, as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this, anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults. This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy, but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Reasoning Dynamics with Mutual Information: Thinking Tokens are Information Peaks in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02867</link>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities.

      <title>UniWorld-V1: High-Resolution Semantic Encoders for Unified Visual Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1 achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.</description>
