      <title>CycleResearcher: Improving Automated Research via Automated Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper revision. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves a 26.89\% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) over individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating that LLMs can surpass expert-level performance in research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, surpassing the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts and approaching the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and advancing AI-driven research capabilities.

      <title>Survey of Cultural Awareness in Language Models: Text and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale deployment of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, requires LLMs to be culturally sensitive to the user to ensure inclusivity. Culture has been widely studied in psychology and anthropology, and there has been a recent surge in research on making LLMs more culturally inclusive in LLMs that goes beyond multilinguality and builds on findings from psychology and anthropology. In this paper, we survey efforts towards incorporating cultural awareness into text-based and multimodal LLMs. We start by defining cultural awareness in LLMs, taking the definitions of culture from anthropology and psychology as a point of departure. We then examine methodologies adopted for creating cross-cultural datasets, strategies for cultural inclusion in downstream tasks, and methodologies that have been used for benchmarking cultural awareness in LLMs. Further, we discuss the ethical implications of cultural alignment, the role of Human-Computer Interaction in driving cultural inclusion in LLMs, and the role of cultural alignment in driving social science research. We finally provide pointers to future research based on our findings about gaps in the literature.</description>

      <title>Next-Token Prediction Task Assumes Optimal Data Ordering for LLM Training in Proof Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM)-based proof generation, despite being trained on extensive corpora such as OpenWebMath and Arxiv, these models still exhibit only modest performance on proving tasks of moderate difficulty. We believe that this is partly due to the suboptimal order of each proof data used in training. Published proofs often follow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the previous steps based on the deductive rules. However, this order aims to facilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help people and models learn the discovery process of the proof. In proof generation, we argue that the optimal order for one training data sample occurs when the relevant intermediate supervision for a particular proof step in the proof is always positioned to the left of that proof step. We call such order the intuitively sequential order. We validate our claims using two tasks: intuitionistic propositional logic theorem-proving and digit multiplication. Our experiments verify the order effect and provide support for our explanations. We demonstrate that training is most effective when the proof is in the intuitively sequential order. Moreover, the order effect and the performance gap between models trained on different data orders are substantial -- with an 11 percent improvement in proof success rate observed in the propositional logic theorem-proving task, between models trained on the optimal order compared to the worst order.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Knowledge Mismatch Hypothesis: Hallucination Propensity in Small Models Fine-tuned on Data from Larger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion of large language models created through fine-tuning with data from larger models. These small models able to produce outputs that appear qualitatively similar to significantly larger models. However, one of the key limitations that have been observed with these models is their propensity to hallucinate significantly more often than larger models. In particular, they have been observed to generate coherent outputs that involve factually incorrect information and spread misinformation, toxicity, and stereotypes. There are many potential causes of hallucination, of which, one hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on data produced by a larger model leads to a knowledge mismatch which contributes to hallucination. In particular, it is hypothesized that there is a mismatch between the knowledge that is fed to the model to fine-tune it and the knowledge that is already present in the graph. Fine-tuning the model on data that has such mismatch could contribute to an increased propensity to hallucinate. We show that on an unseen test set, a smaller model fine-tuned on data generated from a larger model produced more wrong answers when compared to models fine-tuned on data created by the small model, which confirms the hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scale: The Efficacy of Fine-Tuned Open-Source LLMs in Large-Scale Reproducible Social Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their architecture, which dictates their parameter size and performance capabilities. Social scientists have increasingly adopted LLMs for text classification tasks, which are difficult to scale with human coders. While very large, closed-source models often deliver superior performance, their use presents significant risks. These include lack of transparency, potential exposure of sensitive data, challenges to replicability, and dependence on proprietary systems. Additionally, their high costs make them impractical for large-scale research projects.
  In contrast, open-source models, although available in various sizes, may underperform compared to commercial alternatives if used without further fine-tuning. However, open-source models offer distinct advantages: they can be run locally (ensuring data privacy), fine-tuned for specific tasks, shared within the research community, and integrated into reproducible workflows.
  This study demonstrates that small, fine-tuned open-source LLMs can achieve equal or superior performance to models such as ChatGPT-4. We further explore the relationship between training set size and fine-tuning efficacy in open-source models. Finally, we propose a hybrid workflow that leverages the strengths of both open and closed models, offering a balanced approach to performance, transparency, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Traditional Chinese Medicine Capabilities of Large Language Model through Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models perform well in understanding and responding to user intent, their performance in specialized domains such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains limited due to lack of expertise. In addition, high-quality data related to TCM is scarce and difficult to obtain, making large language models ineffective in handling TCM tasks. In this work, we propose a framework to improve the performance of large language models for TCM tasks using only a small amount of data. First, we use medical case data for supervised fine-tuning of the large model, making it initially capable of performing TCM tasks. Subsequently, we further optimize the model's performance using reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) to align it with the preference data. The ablation study also demonstrated the performance gain is attributed to both supervised fine-tuning and the direct policy optimization. The experimental results show that the model trained with a small amount of data achieves a significant performance improvement on a representative TCM task.</description>

      <title>LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoEs) plays an important role in the development of more efficient and effective large language models (LLMs). Due to the enormous resource requirements, studying large scale MoE algorithms remain in-accessible to many researchers. This work develops \emph{LibMoE}, a comprehensive and modular framework to streamline the research, training, and evaluation of MoE algorithms. Built upon three core principles: (i) modular design, (ii) efficient training; (iii) comprehensive evaluation, LibMoE brings MoE in LLMs more accessible to a wide range of researchers by standardizing the training and evaluation pipelines. Using LibMoE, we extensively benchmarked five state-of-the-art MoE algorithms over three different LLMs and 11 datasets under the zero-shot setting. The results show that despite the unique characteristics, all MoE algorithms perform roughly similar when averaged across a wide range of tasks. With the modular design and extensive evaluation, we believe LibMoE will be invaluable for researchers to make meaningful progress towards the next generation of MoE and LLMs. Project page: \url{https://fsoft-aic.github.io/fsoft-LibMoE.github.io}.</description>

      <title>ReSpAct: Harmonizing Reasoning, Speaking, and Acting Towards Building Large Language Model-Based Conversational AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have been increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g., games, APIs, etc.) and solve tasks. However, current frameworks do not enable these agents to work with users and interact with them to align on the details of their tasks and reach user-defined goals; instead, in ambiguous situations, these agents may make decisions based on assumptions. This work introduces ReSpAct (Reason, Speak, and Act), a novel framework that synergistically combines the essential skills for building task-oriented "conversational" agents. ReSpAct addresses this need for agents, expanding on the ReAct approach. The ReSpAct framework enables agents to interpret user instructions, reason about complex tasks, execute appropriate actions, and engage in dynamic dialogue to seek guidance, clarify ambiguities, understand user preferences, resolve problems, and use the intermediate feedback and responses of users to update their plans. We evaluated ReSpAct in environments supporting user interaction, such as task-oriented dialogue (MultiWOZ) and interactive decision-making (AlfWorld, WebShop). ReSpAct is flexible enough to incorporate dynamic user feedback and addresses prevalent issues like error propagation and agents getting stuck in reasoning loops. This results in more interpretable, human-like task-solving trajectories than relying solely on reasoning traces. In two interactive decision-making benchmarks, AlfWorld and WebShop, ReSpAct outperform the strong reasoning-only method ReAct by an absolute success rate of 6% and 4%, respectively. In the task-oriented dialogue benchmark MultiWOZ, ReSpAct improved Inform and Success scores by 5.5% and 3%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generic Embedding-Based Lexicons for Transparent and Reproducible Text Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With text analysis tools becoming increasingly sophisticated over the last decade, researchers now face a decision of whether to use state-of-the-art models that provide high performance but that can be highly opaque in their operations and computationally intensive to run. The alternative, frequently, is to rely on older, manually crafted textual scoring tools that are transparently and easily applied, but can suffer from limited performance. I present an alternative that combines the strengths of both: lexicons created with minimal researcher inputs from generic (pretrained) word embeddings. Presenting a number of conceptual lexicons produced from FastText and GloVe (6B) vector representations of words, I argue that embedding-based lexicons respond to a need for transparent yet high-performance text measuring tools.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AAC Software for Dysarthric Speakers in e-Health Settings: An Evaluation Using TORGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frequently face challenges with articulation, leading to dysarthria and resulting in atypical speech patterns. In healthcare settings, coomunication breakdowns reduce the quality of care. While building an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tool to enable fluid communication we found that state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology like Whisper and Wav2vec2.0 marginalizes atypical speakers largely due to the lack of training data. Our work looks to leverage SOTA ASR followed by domain specific error-correction. English dysarthric ASR performance is often evaluated on the TORGO dataset. Prompt-overlap is a well-known issue with this dataset where phrases overlap between training and test speakers. Our work proposes an algorithm to break this prompt-overlap. After reducing prompt-overlap, results with SOTA ASR models produce extremely high word error rates for speakers with mild and severe dysarthria. Furthermore, to improve ASR, our work looks at the impact of n-gram language models and large-language model (LLM) based multi-modal generative error-correction algorithms like Whispering-LLaMA for a second pass ASR. Our work highlights how much more needs to be done to improve ASR for atypical speakers to enable equitable healthcare access both in-person and in e-health settings.</description>

      <title>FedDTPT: Federated Discrete and Transferable Prompt Tuning for Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</description>

      <title>Provenance: A Light-weight Fact-checker for Retrieval Augmented LLM Generation Output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a light-weight approach for detecting nonfactual outputs from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Given a context and putative output, we compute a factuality score that can be thresholded to yield a binary decision to check the results of LLM-based question-answering, summarization, or other systems. Unlike factuality checkers that themselves rely on LLMs, we use compact, open-source natural language inference (NLI) models that yield a freely accessible solution with low latency and low cost at run-time, and no need for LLM fine-tuning. The approach also enables downstream mitigation and correction of hallucinations, by tracing them back to specific context chunks. Our experiments show high area under the ROC curve (AUC) across a wide range of relevant open source datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our method for fact-checking RAG output.</description>

      <title>Birdie: Advancing State Space Models with Reward-Driven Objectives and Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), including linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, have emerged as potential alternative language models to Transformers. While efficient, SSMs struggle with tasks requiring in-context retrieval, such as text copying and associative recall, limiting their usefulness in practical settings. Prior work on how to meet this challenge has focused on the internal model architecture and not investigated the role of the training procedure. This paper proposes a new training procedure that strongly improves the performance of SSMs on retrieval-intensive tasks. This novel pre-training procedure combines a bidirectional processing of the input with dynamic mixtures of pre-training objectives to improve the utilization of the SSM's fixed-size state. Our experimental evaluations show that Birdie significantly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks that challenge current SSMs, such as phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling tasks. Our findings offer insights into a new direction to advance the training of SSMs to close the performance gap with Transformers.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risks of Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding in large language models (LLMs) accelerates token generation by speculatively predicting multiple tokens cheaply and verifying them in parallel, and has been widely deployed. In this paper, we provide the first study demonstrating the privacy risks of speculative decoding. We observe that input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect predictions can be leaked out to an adversary monitoring token generation times and packet sizes, leading to privacy breaches. By observing the pattern of correctly and incorrectly speculated tokens, we show that a malicious adversary can fingerprint queries and learn private user inputs with more than $90\%$ accuracy across three different speculative decoding techniques - BiLD (almost $100\%$ accuracy), LADE (up to $92\%$ accuracy), and REST (up to $95\%$ accuracy). We show that an adversary can also leak out confidential intellectual property used to design these techniques, such as data from data-stores used for prediction (in REST) at a rate of more than $25$ tokens per second, or even hyper-parameters used for prediction (in LADE). We also discuss mitigation strategies, such as aggregating tokens across multiple iterations and padding packets with additional bytes, to avoid such privacy or confidentiality breaches.</description>

      <title>Emoji Attack: A Method for Misleading Judge LLMs in Safety Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks show how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be tricked into generating harmful outputs using malicious prompts. To prevent these attacks, other LLMs are often used as judges to evaluate the harmfulness of the generated content. However, relying on LLMs as judges can introduce biases into the detection process, which in turn compromises the effectiveness of the evaluation. In this paper, we show that Judge LLMs, like other LLMs, are also affected by token segmentation bias. This bias occurs when tokens are split into smaller sub-tokens, altering their embeddings. This makes it harder for the model to detect harmful content. Specifically, this bias can cause sub-tokens to differ significantly from the original token in the embedding space, leading to incorrect "safe" predictions for harmful content. To exploit this bias in Judge LLMs, we introduce the Emoji Attack -- a method that places emojis within tokens to increase the embedding differences between sub-tokens and their originals. These emojis create new tokens that further distort the token embeddings, exacerbating the bias. To counter the Emoji Attack, we design prompts that help LLMs filter out unusual characters. However, this defense can still be bypassed by using a mix of emojis and other characters. The Emoji Attack can also be combined with existing jailbreaking prompts using few-shot learning, which enables LLMs to generate harmful responses with emojis. These responses are often mistakenly labeled as "safe" by Judge LLMs, allowing the attack to slip through. Our experiments with six state-of-the-art Judge LLMs show that the Emoji Attack allows 25\% of harmful responses to bypass detection by Llama Guard and Llama Guard 2, and up to 75\% by ShieldLM. These results highlight the need for stronger Judge LLMs to address this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Plentiful Jailbreaks with String Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to a slew of adversarial attacks and jailbreaking methods. One common approach employed by white-hat attackers, or \textit{red-teamers}, is to process model inputs and outputs using string-level obfuscations, which can include leetspeak, rotary ciphers, Base64, ASCII, and more. Our work extends these encoding-based attacks by unifying them in a framework of invertible string transformations. With invertibility, we can devise arbitrary \textit{string compositions}, defined as sequences of transformations, that we can encode and decode end-to-end programmatically. We devise a automated best-of-n attack that samples from a combinatorially large number of string compositions. Our jailbreaks obtain competitive attack success rates on several leading frontier models when evaluated on HarmBench, highlighting that encoding-based attacks remain a persistent vulnerability even in advanced LLMs.</description>

      <title>TabVer: Tabular Fact Verification with Natural Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact verification on tabular evidence incentivises the use of symbolic reasoning models where a logical form is constructed (e.g. a LISP-style program), providing greater verifiability than fully neural approaches. However, these systems typically rely on well-formed tables, restricting their use in many scenarios. An emerging symbolic reasoning paradigm for textual evidence focuses on natural logic inference, which constructs proofs by modelling set-theoretic relations between a claim and its evidence in natural language. This approach provides flexibility and transparency but is less compatible with tabular evidence since the relations do not extend to arithmetic functions. We propose a set-theoretic interpretation of numerals and arithmetic functions in the context of natural logic, enabling the integration of arithmetic expressions in deterministic proofs. We leverage large language models to generate arithmetic expressions by generating questions about salient parts of a claim which are answered by executing appropriate functions on tables. In a few-shot setting on FEVEROUS, we achieve an accuracy of 71.4, outperforming both fully neural and symbolic reasoning models by 3.4 points. When evaluated on TabFact without any further training, our method remains competitive with an accuracy lead of 0.5 points.</description>

      <title>How Effective Is Self-Consistency for Long-Context Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistency (SC) has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks and domains involving short content. However, does this evidence support its effectiveness for long-context problems? This study examines the role of SC in long-context scenarios, where LLMs often struggle with position bias, hindering their ability to utilize information effectively from all parts of their long input context. We examine a range of design parameters, including different models, context lengths, prompt formats, and types of datasets and tasks. Our findings demonstrate that SC, while effective for short-context problems, fundamentally fails for long-context tasks -- not only does it fail to mitigate position bias, but it can also actively degrade performance. We observe that the effectiveness of SC varies with context length and model size but remains mainly unaffected by prompt format or task type. These results provide valuable insight into the limitations of current LLMs in long-context understanding and highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches to address position bias in these models.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Know to Respect Copyright Notice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior study shows that LLMs sometimes generate content that violates copyright. In this paper, we study another important yet underexplored problem, i.e., will LLMs respect copyright information in user input, and behave accordingly? The research problem is critical, as a negative answer would imply that LLMs will become the primary facilitator and accelerator of copyright infringement behavior. We conducted a series of experiments using a diverse set of language models, user prompts, and copyrighted materials, including books, news articles, API documentation, and movie scripts. Our study offers a conservative evaluation of the extent to which language models may infringe upon copyrights when processing user input containing protected material. This research emphasizes the need for further investigation and the importance of ensuring LLMs respect copyright regulations when handling user input to prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of protected content. We also release a benchmark dataset serving as a test bed for evaluating infringement behaviors by LLMs and stress the need for future alignment.</description>

      <title>Dictionary Insertion Prompting for Multilingual Reasoning on Multilingual Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As current training data for Large Language Models (LLMs) are dominated by English corpus, they are English-centric and they present impressive performance on English reasoning tasks.\footnote{This paper primarily studies English-centric models, but our method could be universal by using the centric language in the dictionary for non-English-centric LLMs.} Yet, they usually suffer from lower performance in other languages. There are about 7,000 languages over the world, and many are low-resourced on English-centric LLMs. For the sake of people who primarily speak these languages, it is especially urgent to enable our LLMs in those languages. Model training is usually effective, but computationally expensive and requires experienced NLP practitioners. This paper presents a novel and simple yet effective method called \textbf{D}ictionary \textbf{I}nsertion \textbf{P}rompting (\textbf{DIP}). When providing a non-English prompt, DIP looks up a word dictionary and inserts words' English counterparts into the prompt for LLMs. It then enables better translation into English and better English model thinking steps which leads to obviously better results. We experiment with about 200 languages from FLORES-200. Since there are no adequate datasets, we use the NLLB translator to create synthetic multilingual benchmarks from the existing 4 English reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and AQuA. Despite the simplicity and computationally lightweight, we surprisingly found the effectiveness of DIP on math and commonsense reasoning tasks on multiple open-source and close-source LLMs.\footnote{Our dictionaries, code, and synthetic benchmarks will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.}</description>

      <title>CmdCaliper: A Semantic-Aware Command-Line Embedding Model and Dataset for Security Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses command-line embedding in cybersecurity, a field obstructed by the lack of comprehensive datasets due to privacy and regulation concerns. We propose the first dataset of similar command lines, named CyPHER, for training and unbiased evaluation. The training set is generated using a set of large language models (LLMs) comprising 28,520 similar command-line pairs. Our testing dataset consists of 2,807 similar command-line pairs sourced from authentic command-line data.
  In addition, we propose a command-line embedding model named CmdCaliper, enabling the computation of semantic similarity with command lines. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the smallest version of CmdCaliper (30 million parameters) suppresses state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence embedding models with ten times more parameters across various tasks (e.g., malicious command-line detection and similar command-line retrieval).
  Our study explores the feasibility of data generation using LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. Furthermore, we release our proposed command-line dataset, embedding models' weights and all program codes to the public. This advancement paves the way for more effective command-line embedding for future researchers.</description>

      <title>Swan and ArabicMTEB: Dialect-Aware, Arabic-Centric, Cross-Lingual, and Cross-Cultural Embedding Models and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Swan, a family of embedding models centred around the Arabic language, addressing both small-scale and large-scale use cases. Swan includes two variants: Swan-Small, based on ARBERTv2, and Swan-Large, built on ArMistral, a pretrained Arabic large language model. To evaluate these models, we propose ArabicMTEB, a comprehensive benchmark suite that assesses cross-lingual, multi-dialectal, multi-domain, and multi-cultural Arabic text embedding performance, covering eight diverse tasks and spanning 94 datasets. Swan-Large achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming Multilingual-E5-large in most Arabic tasks, while the Swan-Small consistently surpasses Multilingual-E5 base. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that Swan models are both dialectally and culturally aware, excelling across various Arabic domains while offering significant monetary efficiency. This work significantly advances the field of Arabic language modelling and provides valuable resources for future research and applications in Arabic natural language processing. Our models and benchmark will be made publicly accessible for research.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Finetuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the landscape of large language models expands, efficiently finetuning for specific tasks becomes increasingly crucial. At the same time, the landscape of parameter-efficient finetuning methods rapidly expands. Consequently, practitioners face a multitude of complex choices when searching for an optimal finetuning pipeline for large language models. To reduce the complexity for practitioners, we investigate transfer learning for finetuning large language models and aim to transfer knowledge about configurations from related finetuning tasks to a new task. In this work, we transfer learn finetuning by meta-learning performance and cost surrogate models for grey-box meta-optimization from a new meta-dataset. Counter-intuitively, we propose to rely only on transfer learning for new datasets. Thus, we do not use task-specific Bayesian optimization but prioritize knowledge transferred from related tasks over task-specific feedback. We evaluate our method on eight synthetic question-answer datasets and a meta-dataset consisting of 1,800 runs of finetuning Microsoft's Phi-3. Our transfer learning is superior to zero-shot, default finetuning, and meta-optimization baselines. Our results demonstrate the transferability of finetuning to adapt large language models more effectively.</description>

      <title>PRIMO: Progressive Induction for Multi-hop Open Rule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open rule refer to the implication from premise atoms to hypothesis atoms, which captures various relations between instances in the real world. Injecting open rule knowledge into the machine helps to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as dialogue and relation extraction. Existing approaches focus on single-hop open rule generation, ignoring multi-hop scenarios, leading to logical inconsistencies between premise and hypothesis atoms, as well as semantic duplication of generated rule atoms. To address these issues, we propose a progressive multi-stage open rule generation method called PRIMO. We introduce ontology information during the rule generation stage to reduce ambiguity and improve rule accuracy. PRIMO constructs a multi-stage structure consisting of generation, extraction, and ranking modules to fully leverage the latent knowledge within the language model across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we employ reinforcement learning from human feedback to further optimize model, enhancing the model's understanding of commonsense knowledge. Experiments show that compared to baseline models, PRIMO significantly improves rule quality and diversity while reducing the repetition rate of rule atoms.</description>

      <title>One Arrow, Many Targets: Probing LLMs for Multi-Attribute Controllable Text Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text summarization is a well-established task within the natural language processing (NLP) community. However, the focus on controllable summarization tailored to user requirements is gaining traction only recently. While several efforts explore controllability in text summarization, the investigation of Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization (MACS) remains limited. This work addresses this gap by examining the MACS task through the lens of large language models (LLMs), using various learning paradigms, particularly low-rank adapters. We experiment with different popular adapter fine-tuning strategies to assess the effectiveness of the resulting models in retaining cues and patterns associated with multiple controllable attributes. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a novel hierarchical adapter fusion technique to integrate learnings from two distinct controllable attributes. Subsquently, we present our findings, discuss the challenges encountered, and suggest potential avenues for advancing the MACS task.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a prominent technique for LLM-generated content detection by embedding imperceptible patterns. Despite supreme performance, its robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. Previous work typically considers a grey-box attack setting, where the specific type of watermark is already known. Some even necessitates knowledge about hyperparameters of the watermarking method. Such prerequisites are unattainable in real-world scenarios. Targeting at a more realistic black-box threat model with fewer assumptions, we here propose $\mathcal{B}^4$, a black-box scrubbing attack on watermarks. Specifically, we formulate the watermark scrubbing attack as a constrained optimization problem by capturing its objectives with two distributions, a Watermark Distribution and a Fidelity Distribution. This optimization problem can be approximately solved using two proxy distributions. Experimental results across 12 different settings demonstrate the superior performance of $\mathcal{B}^4$ compared with other baselines.</description>

      <title>PMoL: Parameter Efficient MoE for Preference Mixing of LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been proven to be an effective method for preference alignment of large language models (LLMs) and is widely used in the post-training process of LLMs. However, RLHF struggles with handling multiple competing preferences. This leads to a decrease in the alignment of LLMs with human preferences. To address this issue, we propose Preference Mixture of LoRAs (PMoL) from the perspective of model architecture, which can adapt to any number of preferences to mix. PMoL combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low Rank Adaptor (LoRA). This architecture is innovatively applied to the research of preference alignment and has achieved significant performance improvement. The expert group soft loss is used to enable MoE with the ability to mix preferences. Through comprehensive evaluation by the reward model and GPT-4o, the experiment results show that PMoL has superior preference mixing capabilities compared to baseline methods. PMoL achieves better preference alignment with lower training costs.</description>

      <title>An Innovative CGL-MHA Model for Sarcasm Sentiment Recognition Using the MindSpore Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive use of the Internet and social media introduces significant challenges to automated sentiment analysis, particularly for sarcastic expressions in user-generated content. Sarcasm conveys negative emotions through ostensibly positive or exaggerated language, complicating its detection within natural language processing tasks. To address this, we propose an innovative sarcasm detection model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms. The CNN component captures local n-gram features, while GRU and LSTM layers model sequential dependencies and contextual information. Multi-Head Attention enhances the model's focus on relevant parts of the input, improving interpretability. Experiments on two sarcasm detection datasets, Headlines and Riloff, demonstrate that the model achieves an accuracy of 81.20% and an F1 score of 80.77% on Headlines, and an accuracy of 79.72% with an F1 score of 61.39% on Riloff, outperforming traditional models. These results validate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach for sarcasm detection in social media texts.</description>

      <title>NLP and Education: using semantic similarity to evaluate filled gaps in a large-scale Cloze test in the classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the applicability of the Cloze test, a widely used tool for assessing text comprehension proficiency, while highlighting its challenges in large-scale implementation. To address these limitations, an automated correction approach was proposed, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly word embeddings (WE) models, to assess semantic similarity between expected and provided answers. Using data from Cloze tests administered to students in Brazil, WE models for Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) were employed to measure the semantic similarity of the responses. The results were validated through an experimental setup involving twelve judges who classified the students' answers. A comparative analysis between the WE models' scores and the judges' evaluations revealed that GloVe was the most effective model, demonstrating the highest correlation with the judges' assessments. This study underscores the utility of WE models in evaluating semantic similarity and their potential to enhance large-scale Cloze test assessments. Furthermore, it contributes to educational assessment methodologies by offering a more efficient approach to evaluating reading proficiency.</description>

      <title>Varco Arena: A Tournament Approach to Reference-Free Benchmarking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates robust evaluation methodologies. Current benchmarking approaches often rely on comparing model outputs against predefined prompts and reference outputs. Relying on predefined reference outputs hinders flexible adaptation of benchmarks to the rapidly evolving capabilities of LLMs. This limitation necessitates periodic efforts to prepare new benchmarks. To keep pace with rapidly evolving LLM capabilities, we propose a more flexible benchmarking approach. Our method, \textit{\textbf{Varco Arena}}, provides reference-free benchmarking of LLMs in tournament style. \textit{\textbf{Varco Arena}} directly compares LLM outputs across a diverse set of prompts, determining model rankings through a single-elimination tournament structure. This direct pairwise comparison offers two key advantages: (1) Direct comparison, unmediated by reference text, more effectively orders competing LLMs, resulting in more reliable rankings, and (2) reference-free approach to benchmarking adds flexibility in updating benchmark prompts by eliminating the need for quality references. Our empirical results, supported by simulation experiments, demonstrate that the \textit{\textbf{Varco Arena}} tournament approach aligns better with the current Elo model for benchmarking LLMs. The alignment is measured in terms of Spearman correlation, showing improvement over current practice of benchmarking that use reference outputs as comparison \textit{anchor}s.</description>

      <title>Can Multimodal Large Language Model Think Analogically?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning, particularly in multimodal contexts, is the foundation of human perception and creativity. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) has recently sparked considerable discussion due to its emergent capabilities. In this paper, we delve into the multimodal analogical reasoning capability of MLLM. Specifically, we explore two facets: \textit{MLLM as an explainer} and \textit{MLLM as a predictor}. In \textit{MLLM as an explainer}, we primarily focus on whether MLLM can deeply comprehend multimodal analogical reasoning problems. We propose a unified prompt template and a method for harnessing the comprehension capabilities of MLLM to augment existing models. In \textit{MLLM as a predictor}, we aim to determine whether MLLM can directly solve multimodal analogical reasoning problems. The experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods on popular datasets, providing preliminary evidence for the analogical reasoning capability of MLLM.</description>

      <title>AMREx: AMR for Explainable Fact Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of social media networks and the vast amount of information circulating through them, automatic fact verification is an essential component to prevent the spread of misinformation. It is even more useful to have fact verification systems that provide explanations along with their classifications to ensure accurate predictions. To address both of these requirements, we implement AMREx, an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)-based veracity prediction and explanation system for fact verification using a combination of Smatch, an AMR evaluation metric to measure meaning containment and textual similarity, and demonstrate its effectiveness in producing partially explainable justifications using two community standard fact verification datasets, FEVER and AVeriTeC. AMREx surpasses the AVeriTec baseline accuracy showing the effectiveness of our approach for real-world claim verification. It follows an interpretable pipeline and returns an explainable AMR node mapping to clarify the system's veracity predictions when applicable. We further demonstrate that AMREx output can be used to prompt LLMs to generate natural-language explanations using the AMR mappings as a guide to lessen the probability of hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Driven Course Generation: A Case Study Using ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores Artificial Intelligence use, specifically ChatGPT, in creating educational content. The study aims to elaborate on using ChatGPT to create course materials. The main objective is to assess the efficiency, quality, and impact of AI-driven course generation, and to create a Multimedia Databases course as a case study. The study highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize educational content creation, making it more accessible, personalized, and efficient. The course content was generated in less than one day through iterative methods, using prompts for translation, content expansion, practical examples, assignments, supplementary materials, and LaTeX formatting. Each part was verified immediately after generation to ensure accuracy. Post-generation analysis with Detectia and Turnitin showed similarity rates of 8.7% and 13%, indicating high originality. Experts and university committees reviewed and approved the course, with English university teachers praising its language quality. ChatGPT also created a well-structured and diversified exam for the module. Key findings reveal significant time efficiency, comprehensive content coverage, and high flexibility. The study underscores AI's transformative potential in education, addressing challenges related to data privacy, technology dependence, content accuracy, and algorithmic biases. The conclusions emphasize the need for collaboration between educators, policymakers, and technology developers to harness AI's benefits in education fully.</description>

      <title>MoCE: Adaptive Mixture of Contextualization Experts for Byte-based Neural Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byte-based machine translation systems have shown significant potential in massively multilingual settings. Unicode encoding, which maps each character to specific byte(s), eliminates the emergence of unknown words, even in new languages, enabling broad language scalability. However, byte-level tokenization results in sequences that are hard to interpret due to limited semantic information per byte. Local contextualization has proven effective in assigning initial semantics to tokens, improving sentence comprehension. Nevertheless, variations in encoding rules across languages necessitate an adaptive approach for effective contextualization. To this end, we propose Adaptive MultiScale-Headed Attention (Ada-MSHA), adaptively selecting and mixing attention heads, which are treated as contextualization experts. This enhances the flexibility of contextualization scales and improves the potential to discover a better strategy than previous methods. Experiment results show that our method outperforms existing methods without extensive manual adjustment of hyper-parameters and surpasses subword-based models with fewer parameters in Ted-59 dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/ictnlp/MoCE.</description>

      <title>Teaching Models to Improve on Tape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle when prompted to generate content under specific constraints. However, in such cases it is often easy to check whether these constraints are satisfied or violated. Recent works have shown that LLMs can benefit from such ``corrective feedback''. Here we claim that this skill of LLMs can be significantly enhanced via training. We introduce an RL framework for teaching models to use such rewards, by simulating interaction sessions, and rewarding the model according to its ability to satisfy the constraints. We refer to our method as CORGI (Controlled Generation with RL for Guided Interaction), and evaluate it on a variety of controlled generation tasks using unlabeled training data. We find that CORGI consistently outperforms the baseline reinforcement learning method that does not incorporate conversational feedback. Furthermore, CORGI's interactive framework enables meta-learning, allowing the LLM to generalize better to guided interaction in new tasks. Our results clearly show that conversational optimization, when combined with reinforcement learning, significantly improves the effectiveness of LLMs in controlled generation contexts.</description>

      <title>Domain-specific Guided Summarization for Mental Health Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In domain-specific contexts, particularly mental health, abstractive summarization requires advanced techniques adept at handling specialized content to generate domain-relevant and faithful summaries. In response to this, we introduce a guided summarizer equipped with a dual-encoder and an adapted decoder that utilizes novel domain-specific guidance signals, i.e., mental health terminologies and contextually rich sentences from the source document, to enhance its capacity to align closely with the content and context of guidance, thereby generating a domain-relevant summary. Additionally, we present a post-editing correction model to rectify errors in the generated summary, thus enhancing its consistency with the original content in detail. Evaluation on the MentSum dataset reveals that our model outperforms existing baseline models in terms of both ROUGE and FactCC scores. Although the experiments are specifically designed for mental health posts, the methodology we've developed offers broad applicability, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in producing high-quality domain-specific summaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SinaTools, an open-source Python package for Arabic natural language processing and understanding. SinaTools is a unified package allowing people to integrate it into their system workflow, offering solutions for various tasks such as flat and nested Named Entity Recognition (NER), fully-flagged Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), Semantic Relatedness, Synonymy Extractions and Evaluation, Lemmatization, Part-of-speech Tagging, Root Tagging, and additional helper utilities such as corpus processing, text stripping methods, and diacritic-aware word matching. This paper presents SinaTools and its benchmarking results, demonstrating that SinaTools outperforms all similar tools on the aforementioned tasks, such as Flat NER (87.33%), Nested NER (89.42%), WSD (82.63%), Semantic Relatedness (0.49 Spearman rank), Lemmatization (90.5%), POS tagging (97.5%), among others.

Abstract: We showcase that ChatGPT can be used to disambiguate lemmas in two endangered languages ChatGPT is not proficient in, namely Erzya and Skolt Sami. We augment our prompt by providing dictionary translations of the candidate lemmas to a majority language - Finnish in our case. This dictionary augmented generation approach results in 50\% accuracy for Skolt Sami and 41\% accuracy for Erzya. On a closer inspection, many of the error types were of the kind even an untrained human annotator would make.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, traditional evaluation metrics tend to saturate, making it challenging to distinguish between models based on their performance. We propose a general method to transform existing LLM evaluations into a series of progressively more difficult tasks. These enhanced evaluations emphasize reasoning capabilities and can reveal relative performance differences that are not apparent in the original assessments.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new multiple-choice test corpus, extend it into a family of evaluations, and assess a collection of LLMs. Our results offer insights into the comparative reasoning abilities of these models, particularly highlighting distinctions between OpenAI's o1-preview and Google's gemini-pro-1.5-002.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the patterns of incorrect answers produced by large language models (LLMs) during evaluation. These errors exhibit highly non-intuitive behaviors unique to each model. By analyzing these patterns, we measure the similarities between LLMs and construct a taxonomy that categorizes them based on their error correlations. Our findings reveal that the incorrect responses are not randomly distributed but systematically correlated across models, providing new insights into the underlying structures and relationships among LLMs.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs good pragmatic speakers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on data assumed to include natural language pragmatics, but do they actually behave like pragmatic speakers? We attempt to answer this question using the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which models pragmatic reasoning in human communication. Using the paradigm of a reference game constructed from the TUNA corpus, we score candidate referential utterances in both a state-of-the-art LLM (Llama3-8B-Instruct) and in the RSA model, comparing and contrasting these scores. Given that RSA requires defining alternative utterances and a truth-conditional meaning function, we explore such comparison for different choices of each of these requirements. We find that while scores from the LLM have some positive correlation with those from RSA, there isn't sufficient evidence to claim that it behaves like a pragmatic speaker. This initial study paves way for further targeted efforts exploring different models and settings, including human-subject evaluation, to see if LLMs truly can, or be made to, behave like pragmatic speakers.</description>

      <title>Explaining and Improving Contrastive Decoding by Extrapolating the Probabilities of a Huge and Hypothetical LM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive decoding (CD) (Li et al., 2023) improves the next-token distribution of a large expert language model (LM) using a small amateur LM. Although CD is applied to various LMs and domains to enhance open-ended text generation, it is still unclear why CD often works well, when it could fail, and how we can make it better. To deepen our understanding of CD, we first theoretically prove that CD could be viewed as linearly extrapolating the next-token logits from a huge and hypothetical LM. We also highlight that the linear extrapolation could make CD unable to output the most obvious answers that have already been assigned high probabilities by the amateur LM.
  To overcome CD's limitation, we propose a new unsupervised decoding method called $\mathbf{A}$symptotic $\mathbf{P}$robability $\mathbf{D}$ecoding (APD). APD explicitly extrapolates the probability curves from the LMs of different sizes to infer the asymptotic probabilities from an infinitely large LM without inducing more inference costs than CD. In FactualityPrompts, an open-ended text generation benchmark, sampling using APD significantly boosts factuality in comparison to the CD sampling and its variants, and achieves state-of-the-art results for Pythia 6.9B and OPT 6.7B. Furthermore, in five commonsense QA datasets, APD is often significantly better than CD and achieves a similar effect of using a larger LLM. For example, the perplexity of APD on top of Pythia 6.9B is even lower than the perplexity of Pythia 12B in CommonsenseQA and LAMBADA.</description>

      <title>UniGuard: Towards Universal Safety Guardrails for Jailbreak Attacks on Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized vision-language understanding but are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks, where adversaries meticulously craft inputs to elicit harmful or inappropriate responses. We propose UniGuard, a novel multimodal safety guardrail that jointly considers the unimodal and cross-modal harmful signals. UniGuard is trained such that the likelihood of generating harmful responses in a toxic corpus is minimized, and can be seamlessly applied to any input prompt during inference with minimal computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability of UniGuard across multiple modalities and attack strategies. It demonstrates impressive generalizability across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA, Gemini Pro, GPT-4, MiniGPT-4, and InstructBLIP, thereby broadening the scope of our solution.</description>

Abstract: Complex Word Identification (CWI) is an essential step in the lexical simplification task and has recently become a task on its own. Some variations of this binary classification task have emerged, such as lexical complexity prediction (LCP) and complexity evaluation of multi-word expressions (MWE). Large language models (LLMs) recently became popular in the Natural Language Processing community because of their versatility and capability to solve unseen tasks in zero/few-shot settings. Our work investigates LLM usage, specifically open-source models such as Llama 2, Llama 3, and Vicuna v1.5, and closed-source, such as ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o, in the CWI, LCP, and MWE settings. We evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings and show that LLMs struggle in certain conditions or achieve comparable results against existing methods. In addition, we provide some views on meta-learning combined with prompt learning. In the end, we conclude that the current state of LLMs cannot or barely outperform existing methods, which are usually much smaller.</description>

      <title>SPES: Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spurred by the demand for interpretable models, research on eXplainable AI for language technologies has experienced significant growth, with feature attribution methods emerging as a cornerstone of this progress. While prior work in NLP explored such methods for classification tasks and textual applications, explainability intersecting generation and speech is lagging, with existing techniques failing to account for the autoregressive nature of state-of-the-art models and to provide fine-grained, phonetically meaningful explanations. We address this gap by introducing Spectrogram Perturbation for Explainable Speech-to-text Generation (SPES), a feature attribution technique applicable to sequence generation tasks with autoregressive models. SPES provides explanations for each predicted token based on both the input spectrogram and the previously generated tokens. Extensive evaluation on speech recognition and translation demonstrates that SPES generates explanations that are faithful and plausible to humans.</description>

      <title>DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly-scoped environments, we argue that it presents two major challenges when deploying LLM agents in real-world scenarios: (1) selecting from a fixed set of actions significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) this approach requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which becomes impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. In this work, we propose an LLM agent framework that enables the dynamic creation and composition of actions in an online manner. In this framework, the agent interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language at each step. Furthermore, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that this framework offers significantly greater flexibility and outperforms previous methods. Notably, it allows an LLM agent to recover in scenarios where no relevant action exists in the predefined set or when existing actions fail due to unforeseen edge cases. At the time of writing, we hold the top position on the GAIA public leaderboard.

      <title>RAGViz: Diagnose and Visualize Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines knowledge from domain-specific sources into large language models to ground answer generation. Current RAG systems lack customizable visibility on the context documents and the model's attentiveness towards such documents. We propose RAGViz, a RAG diagnosis tool that visualizes the attentiveness of the generated tokens in retrieved documents. With a built-in user interface, retrieval index, and Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, RAGViz provides two main functionalities: (1) token and document-level attention visualization, and (2) generation comparison upon context document addition and removal. As an open-source toolkit, RAGViz can be easily hosted with a custom embedding model and HuggingFace-supported LLM backbone. Using a hybrid ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) index, memory-efficient LLM inference tool, and custom context snippet method, RAGViz operates efficiently with a median query time of about 5 seconds on a moderate GPU node. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/RAGViz. A demo video of RAGViz can be found at https://youtu.be/cTAbuTu6ur4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates supervised fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to improve their pedagogical alignment in computing education, addressing concerns that LLMs may hinder learning outcomes. The project utilised a proprietary dataset of 2,500 high quality question/answer pairs from programming course forums, and explores two research questions: the suitability of university course forums in contributing to fine-tuning datasets, and how supervised fine-tuning can improve LLMs' alignment with educational principles such as constructivism. Initial findings suggest benefits in pedagogical alignment of LLMs, with deeper evaluations required.</description>

      <title>Align-SLM: Textless Spoken Language Models with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While textless Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have shown potential in end-to-end speech-to-speech modeling, they still lag behind text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of semantic coherence and relevance. This work introduces the Align-SLM framework, which leverages preference optimization inspired by Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) to enhance the semantic understanding of SLMs. Our approach generates multiple speech continuations from a given prompt and uses semantic metrics to create preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We evaluate the framework using ZeroSpeech 2021 benchmarks for lexical and syntactic modeling, the spoken version of the StoryCloze dataset for semantic coherence, and other speech generation metrics, including the GPT4-o score and human evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for SLMs on most benchmarks, highlighting the importance of preference optimization to improve the semantics of SLMs.</description>

      <title>TriG-NER: Triplet-Grid Framework for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition (DNER) presents a challenging problem where entities may be scattered across multiple non-adjacent tokens, making traditional sequence labelling approaches inadequate. Existing methods predominantly rely on custom tagging schemes to handle these discontinuous entities, resulting in models tightly coupled to specific tagging strategies and lacking generalisability across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose TriG-NER, a novel Triplet-Grid Framework that introduces a generalisable approach to learning robust token-level representations for discontinuous entity extraction. Our framework applies triplet loss at the token level, where similarity is defined by word pairs existing within the same entity, effectively pulling together similar and pushing apart dissimilar ones. This approach enhances entity boundary detection and reduces the dependency on specific tagging schemes by focusing on word-pair relationships within a flexible grid structure. We evaluate TriG-NER on three benchmark DNER datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over existing grid-based architectures. These results underscore our framework's effectiveness in capturing complex entity structures and its adaptability to various tagging schemes, setting a new benchmark for discontinuous entity extraction.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Learn to Skip Steps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trained on vast corpora of human language, language models demonstrate emergent human-like reasoning abilities. Yet they are still far from true intelligence, which opens up intriguing opportunities to explore the parallels of humans and model behaviors. In this work, we study the ability to skip steps in reasoning - a hallmark of human expertise developed through practice. Unlike humans, who may skip steps to enhance efficiency or to reduce cognitive load, models do not inherently possess such motivations to minimize reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce a controlled framework that stimulates step-skipping behavior by iteratively refining models to generate shorter and accurate reasoning paths. Empirical results indicate that models can develop the step skipping ability under our guidance. Moreover, after fine-tuning on expanded datasets that include both complete and skipped reasoning sequences, the models can not only resolve tasks with increased efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, but also exhibit comparable and even enhanced generalization capabilities in out-of-domain scenarios. Our work presents the first exploration into human-like step-skipping ability and provides fresh perspectives on how such cognitive abilities can benefit AI models.</description>

      <title>Culinary Class Wars: Evaluating LLMs using ASH in Cuisine Transfer Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various creative domains, including culinary arts. However, many LLMs still struggle to deliver the desired level of culinary creativity, especially when tasked with adapting recipes to meet specific cultural requirements. This study focuses on cuisine transfer-applying elements of one cuisine to another-to assess LLMs' culinary creativity. We employ a diverse set of LLMs to generate and evaluate culturally adapted recipes, comparing their evaluations against LLM and human judgments. We introduce the ASH (authenticity, sensitivity, harmony) benchmark to evaluate LLMs' recipe generation abilities in the cuisine transfer task, assessing their cultural accuracy and creativity in the culinary domain. Our findings reveal crucial insights into both generative and evaluative capabilities of LLMs in the culinary domain, highlighting strengths and limitations in understanding and applying cultural nuances in recipe creation. The code and dataset used in this project will be openly available in \url{http://github.com/dmis-lab/CulinaryASH}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcut learning refers to the phenomenon where models employ simple, non-robust decision rules in practical tasks, which hinders their generalization and robustness. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown the impact of shortcut learning on LLMs. This paper provides a novel perspective to review relevant research on shortcut learning in In-Context Learning (ICL). It conducts a detailed exploration of the types of shortcuts in ICL tasks, their causes, available benchmarks, and strategies for mitigating shortcuts. Based on corresponding observations, it summarizes the unresolved issues in existing research and attempts to outline the future research landscape of shortcut learning.</description>

      <title>Explainable cognitive decline detection in free dialogues with a Machine Learning approach based on pre-trained Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive and neurological impairments are very common, but only a small proportion of affected individuals are diagnosed and treated, partly because of the high costs associated with frequent screening. Detecting pre-illness stages and analyzing the progression of neurological disorders through effective and efficient intelligent systems can be beneficial for timely diagnosis and early intervention. We propose using Large Language Models to extract features from free dialogues to detect cognitive decline. These features comprise high-level reasoning content-independent features (such as comprehension, decreased awareness, increased distraction, and memory problems). Our solution comprises (i) preprocessing, (ii) feature engineering via Natural Language Processing techniques and prompt engineering, (iii) feature analysis and selection to optimize performance, and (iv) classification, supported by automatic explainability. We also explore how to improve Chatgpt's direct cognitive impairment prediction capabilities using the best features in our models. Evaluation metrics obtained endorse the effectiveness of a mixed approach combining feature extraction with Chatgpt and a specialized Machine Learning model to detect cognitive decline within free-form conversational dialogues with older adults. Ultimately, our work may facilitate the development of an inexpensive, non-invasive, and rapid means of detecting and explaining cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>Scalable Efficient Training of Large Language Models with Low-dimensional Projected Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) simultaneously is a critical yet challenging research goal. In this paper, we find that low-rank pre-training, normally considered as efficient methods that will compromise performance, can be scalably effective when reduced parameters are precisely targeted. Specifically, applying the low-dimensional module only to the attention layer -- resolves this issue and enhances both effectiveness and efficiency. We refer to this structure as Low-dimensional Projected Attention (LPA) and provide an explanatory analysis. Through extensive experimentation at parameter scales of 130M, 370M, and scaling up to 3B, we have validated the effectiveness and scalability of LPA. Our results show that LPA model can save up to 12.4% in time while achieving an approximate 5% improvement in test perplexity (ppl) and on downstream tasks compared with the vanilla Transformer.</description>

      <title>Regress, Don't Guess -- A Regression-like Loss on Number Tokens for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While language models have exceptional capabilities at text generation, they lack a natural inductive bias for emitting numbers and thus struggle in tasks involving reasoning over quantities, especially arithmetics. This has particular relevance in scientific datasets where combinations of text and numerical data are abundant. One fundamental limitation is the nature of the CE loss, which assumes a nominal (categorical) scale and thus cannot convey proximity between generated number tokens. As a remedy, we here present two versions of a number token loss. The first is based on an $L_p$ loss between the ground truth token value and the weighted sum of the predicted class probabilities. The second loss minimizes the Wasserstein-1 distance between the distribution of the predicted output probabilities and the ground truth distribution. These regression-like losses can easily be added to any language model and extend the CE objective during training. We compare the proposed schemes on a mathematics dataset against existing tokenization, encoding, and decoding schemes for improving number representation in language models. Our results reveal a significant improvement in numerical accuracy when equipping a standard T5 model with the proposed loss schemes.</description>

      <title>Advancements and limitations of LLMs in replicating human color-word associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT- 4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words from eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category, particularly when using visual inputs rather than text-based color codes. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT4-o with visual inputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly across word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate human color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to previous studies. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, suggesting differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</description>

      <title>AVSS: Layer Importance Evaluation in Large Language Models via Activation Variance-Sparsity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of layer importance in deep learning has been an active area of research, with significant implications for model optimization and interpretability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence across various domains, yet limited studies have explored the functional importance and performance contributions of individual layers within LLMs, especially from the perspective of activation distribution. In this work, we propose the Activation Variance-Sparsity Score (AVSS), a novel metric combining normalized activation variance and sparsity to assess each layer's contribution to model performance. By identifying and removing approximately the lowest 25% of layers based on AVSS, we achieve over 90% of original model performance across tasks such as question answering, language modeling, and sentiment classification, indicating that these layers may be non-essential. Our approach provides a systematic method for identifying less critical layers, contributing to efficient large language model architectures.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent agents designed for interactive environments face significant challenges in text-based games, a domain that demands complex reasoning and adaptability. While agents based on large language models (LLMs) using self-reflection have shown promise, they struggle when initially successful and exhibit reduced effectiveness when using smaller LLMs. We introduce Sweet&amp;Sour, a novel approach that addresses these limitations in existing reflection methods by incorporating positive experiences and managed memory to enrich the context available to the agent at decision time. Our comprehensive analysis spans both closed- and open-source LLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of Sweet&amp;Sour in improving agent performance, particularly in scenarios where previous approaches fall short.</description>

      <title>Hunyuan-Large: An Open-Source MoE Model with 52 Billion Activated Parameters by Tencent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.

      <title>The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</description>

      <title>CRMArena: Understanding the Capacity of LLM Agents to Perform Professional CRM Tasks in Realistic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are vital for modern enterprises, providing a foundation for managing customer interactions and data. Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code debugging by directly generating the correct code based on the buggy code snippet. Programming benchmarks, typically consisting of buggy code snippet and their associated test cases, are used to assess the debugging capabilities of LLMs. However, many existing benchmarks primarily focus on Python and are often limited in terms of language diversity (e.g., DebugBench and DebugEval). To advance the field of multilingual debugging with LLMs, we propose the first massively multilingual debugging benchmark, which includes 3.6K test samples of 18 programming languages and covers the automated program repair (APR) task, the code review (CR) task, and the bug identification (BI) task. Further, we introduce the debugging instruction corpora MDEVAL-INSTRUCT by injecting bugs into the correct multilingual queries and solutions (xDebugGen). Further, a multilingual debugger xDebugCoder trained on MDEVAL-INSTRUCT as a strong baseline specifically to handle the bugs of a wide range of programming languages (e.g. "Missing Mut" in language Rust and "Misused Macro Definition" in language C). Our extensive experiments on MDEVAL reveal a notable performance gap between open-source models and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT and Claude series), highlighting huge room for improvement in multilingual code debugging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Creative Short Story Generation in Humans and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storytelling is a fundamental aspect of human communication, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, appropriate, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative capabilities remain underexplored. Previous research has either focused on creativity tests requiring short responses or primarily compared model performance in story generation to that of professional writers. However, the question of whether LLMs exhibit creativity in writing short stories on par with the average human remains unanswered. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across LLMs and everyday people. Using a five-sentence creative story task, commonly employed in psychology to assess human creativity, we automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, and diversity. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate stylistically complex stories, they tend to fall short in terms of creativity when compared to average human writers.</description>

      <title>WebRL: Training LLM Web Agents via Self-Evolving Online Curriculum Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Scientific Hypothesis Generation with Knowledge Grounded Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various scientific domains, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving tasks. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has opened up new possibilities for advancing scientific research, enabling tasks such as data analysis, literature review, and even experimental design. One of the most promising applications of LLMs in this context is hypothesis generation, where they can identify novel research directions by analyzing existing knowledge. However, despite their potential, LLMs are prone to generating ``hallucinations'', outputs that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. Such a problem presents significant challenges in scientific fields that demand rigorous accuracy and verifiability, potentially leading to erroneous or misleading conclusions. To overcome these challenges, we propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that enhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured reasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and includes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations. With experiments on our newly constructed hypothesis generation dataset, we demonstrate that KG-CoI not only improves the accuracy of LLM-generated hypotheses but also reduces the hallucination in their reasoning chains, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing real-world scientific research.</description>

      <title>Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large vision and language models (VLM) have demonstrated significant potential in completing daily computer tasks, such as browsing the web to book travel and operating desktop software, which requires agents to understand these interfaces. Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing the tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques such as asking the agent to ignore pop-ups or including an advertisement notice, are ineffective against the attack.</description>

      <title>Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLM Multilinguality for non-Latin Script Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable benchmark performance, but we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.</description>

      <title>Hazards in Daily Life? Enabling Robots to Proactively Detect and Resolve Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing household robots have made significant progress in performing routine tasks, such as cleaning floors or delivering objects. However, a key limitation of these robots is their inability to recognize potential problems or dangers in home environments. For example, a child may pick up and ingest medication that has fallen on the floor, posing a serious risk. We argue that household robots should proactively detect such hazards or anomalies within the home, and propose the task of anomaly scenario generation. We leverage foundational models instead of relying on manually labeled data to build simulated environments. Specifically, we introduce a multi-agent brainstorming approach, where agents collaborate and generate diverse scenarios covering household hazards, hygiene management, and child safety. These textual task descriptions are then integrated with designed 3D assets to simulate realistic environments. Within these constructed environments, the robotic agent learns the necessary skills to proactively discover and handle the proposed anomalies through task decomposition, and optimal learning approach selection. We demonstrate that our generated environment outperforms others in terms of task description and scene diversity, ultimately enabling robotic agents to better address potential household hazards.</description>

      <title>FIRE: Fact-checking with Iterative Retrieval and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.</description>

      <title>KeyInst: Keyword Instruction for Improving SQL Formulation in Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL parsing involves the translation of natural language queries (NLQs) into their corresponding SQL commands. A principal challenge within this domain is the formulation of SQL queries that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with the natural language input. However, the intrinsic disparity between the NLQ and the SQL poses a significant challenge. In this research, we introduce Keyword Instruction (KeyInst), a novel method designed to enhance SQL formulation by Large Language Models (LLMs). KeyInst essentially provides guidance on pivotal SQL keywords likely to be part of the final query, thus facilitates a smoother SQL query formulation process. We explore two strategies for integrating KeyInst into Text-to-SQL parsing: a pipeline strategy and a single-pass strategy. The former first generates KeyInst for question, which are then used to prompt LLMs. The latter employs a fine-tuned model to concurrently generate KeyInst and SQL in one step. We developed StrucQL, a benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of SQL formulation. Extensive experiments on StrucQL and other benchmarks demonstrate that KeyInst significantly improves upon the existing Text-to-SQL prompting techniques.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dense Reward: Understanding the Gap Between Action and Reward Space in Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven highly effective in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the original RLHF typically optimizes under an overall reward, which can lead to a suboptimal learning process. This limitation stems from RLHF's lack of awareness regarding which specific tokens should be reinforced or suppressed. Moreover, conflicts in supervision can arise, for instance, when a chosen response includes erroneous tokens, while a rejected response contains accurate elements. To rectify these shortcomings, increasing dense reward methods, such as step-wise and token-wise RLHF, have been proposed. However, these existing methods are limited to specific tasks (like mathematics). In this paper, we propose the ``Adaptive Message-wise RLHF'' method, which robustly applies to various tasks. By defining pivot tokens as key indicators, our approach adaptively identifies essential information and converts sample-level supervision into fine-grained, subsequence-level supervision. This aligns the density of rewards and action spaces more closely with the information density of the input. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be integrated into various training methods, significantly mitigating hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting problems while outperforming other methods on multiple evaluation metrics. Our method improves the success rate on adversarial samples by 10\% compared to the sample-wise approach and achieves a 1.3\% improvement on evaluation benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval et al.</description>

      <title>Personality Analysis from Online Short Video Platforms with Multi-domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personality analysis from online short videos has gained prominence due to its applications in personalized recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. Traditional assessment methods, such as questionnaires based on the Big Five Personality Framework, are limited by self-report biases and are impractical for large-scale or real-time analysis. Leveraging the rich, multi-modal data present in short videos offers a promising alternative for more accurate personality inference. However, integrating these diverse and asynchronous modalities poses significant challenges, particularly in aligning time-varying data and ensuring models generalize well to new domains with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal personality analysis framework that addresses these challenges by synchronizing and integrating features from multiple modalities and enhancing model generalization through domain adaptation. We introduce a timestamp-based modality alignment mechanism that synchronizes data based on spoken word timestamps, ensuring accurate correspondence across modalities and facilitating effective feature integration. To capture temporal dependencies and inter-modal interactions, we employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and self-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most informative features for personality prediction. Furthermore, we develop a gradient-based domain adaptation method that transfers knowledge from multiple source domains to improve performance in target domains with scarce labeled data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in personality prediction tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing complex behavioral cues and robustness in adapting to new domains.</description>

      <title>AutoGLM: Autonomous Foundation Agents for GUIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AutoGLM, a new series in the ChatGLM family, designed to serve as foundation agents for autonomous control of digital devices through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). While foundation models excel at acquiring human knowledge, they often struggle with decision-making in dynamic real-world environments, limiting their progress toward artificial general intelligence. This limitation underscores the importance of developing foundation agents capable of learning through autonomous environmental interactions by reinforcing existing models. Focusing on Web Browser and Phone as representative GUI scenarios, we have developed AutoGLM as a practical foundation agent system for real-world GUI interactions. Our approach integrates a comprehensive suite of techniques and infrastructures to create deployable agent systems suitable for user delivery. Through this development, we have derived two key insights: First, the design of an appropriate "intermediate interface" for GUI control is crucial, enabling the separation of planning and grounding behaviors, which require distinct optimization for flexibility and accuracy respectively. Second, we have developed a novel progressive training framework that enables self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning for AutoGLM. Our evaluations demonstrate AutoGLM's effectiveness across multiple domains. For web browsing, AutoGLM achieves a 55.2% success rate on VAB-WebArena-Lite (improving to 59.1% with a second attempt) and 96.2% on OpenTable evaluation tasks. In Android device control, AutoGLM attains a 36.2% success rate on AndroidLab (VAB-Mobile) and 89.7% on common tasks in popular Chinese APPs.</description>

      <title>Mobility-LLM: Learning Visiting Intentions and Travel Preferences from Human Mobility Data with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location-based services (LBS) have accumulated extensive human mobility data on diverse behaviors through check-in sequences. These sequences offer valuable insights into users' intentions and preferences. Yet, existing models analyzing check-in sequences fail to consider the semantics contained in these sequences, which closely reflect human visiting intentions and travel preferences, leading to an incomplete comprehension. Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users' travel preferences. These components enhance the model's ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the effectiveness of Mobility-LLM in advancing our understanding of human mobility data within LBS contexts.</description>

      <title>DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Perspective for Speculative Decoding Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive sampling has been the major bottleneck for slowing down large language model inferences. One effective way to accelerate inference is \emph{Speculative Decoding}, which employs a small model to sample a sequence of draft tokens and a large model to validate. Given its empirical effectiveness, the theoretical understanding of Speculative Decoding is falling behind. This paper tackles this gap by conceptualizing the decoding problem via markov chain abstraction and studying the key properties, \emph{output quality and inference acceleration}, from a theoretical perspective. Our analysis covers the theoretical limits of speculative decoding, batch algorithms, and output quality-inference acceleration tradeoffs. Our results reveal the fundamental connections between different components of LLMs via total variation distances and show how they jointly affect the efficiency of decoding algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic synthesis is a crucial phase in the circuit design process, responsible for transforming hardware description language (HDL) designs into optimized netlists. However, traditional logic synthesis methods are computationally intensive, restricting their iterative use in refining chip designs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly those fine-tuned on programming languages, present a promising alternative. In this paper, we introduce VeriDistill, the first end-to-end machine learning model that directly processes raw Verilog code to predict circuit quality-of-result metrics. Our model employs a novel knowledge distillation method, transferring low-level circuit insights via graphs into the predictor based on LLM. Experiments show VeriDistill outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale Verilog datasets and demonstrates robust performance when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets.</description>

      <title>GWQ: Gradient-Aware Weight Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in solving complex languagetasks. However, its large number of parameterspresent significant challenges for the deployment and application of the model on edge devices. Compressing large language models to low bits can enable them to run on resource-constrained devices, often leading to performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the weights corresponding to the top 1% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit format. GWQ found experimentally that utilizing the sensitive weights in the gradient localization model is more scientific compared to utilizing the sensitive weights in the Hessian matrix localization model. Compared to current quantization methods, GWQ can be applied to multiple language models and achieves lower PPL on the WikiText2 and C4 dataset. In the zero-shot task, GWQ quantized models have higher accuracy compared to other quantization methods.GWQ is also suitable for multimodal model quantization, and the quantized Qwen-VL family model is more accurate than other methods. zero-shot target detection task dataset RefCOCO outperforms the current stat-of-the-arts method SPQR. GWQ achieves 1.2x inference speedup in comparison to the original model, and effectively reduces the inference memory.</description>

      <title>Accelerated AI Inference via Dynamic Execution Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Dynamic Execution techniques that optimize the computation flow based on input. This aims to identify simpler problems that can be solved using fewer resources, similar to human cognition. The techniques discussed include early exit from deep networks, speculative sampling for language models, and adaptive steps for diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that these dynamic approaches can significantly improve latency and throughput without compromising quality. When combined with model-based optimizations, such as quantization, dynamic execution provides a powerful multi-pronged strategy to optimize AI inference.
  Generative AI requires a large amount of compute resources. This is expected to grow, and demand for resources in data centers through to the edge is expected to continue to increase at high rates. We take advantage of existing research and provide additional innovations for some generative optimizations. In the case of LLMs, we provide more efficient sampling methods that depend on the complexity of the data. In the case of diffusion model generation, we provide a new method that also leverages the difficulty of the input prompt to predict an optimal early stopping point.
  Therefore, dynamic execution methods are relevant because they add another dimension of performance optimizations. Performance is critical from a competitive point of view, but increasing capacity can result in significant power savings and cost savings. We have provided several integrations of these techniques into several Intel performance libraries and Huggingface Optimum. These integrations will make them easier to use and increase the adoption of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Models Can Self-Improve Reasoning via Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) has proven to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of multimodal scenarios and the difficulty in collecting high-quality CoT data, CoT reasoning in multimodal LLMs has been largely overlooked. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework, R3V, which iteratively enhances the model's Vision-language Reasoning by Reflecting on CoT Rationales. Our framework consists of two interleaved parts: (1) iteratively bootstrapping positive and negative solutions for reasoning datasets, and (2) reflection on rationale for learning from mistakes. Specifically, we introduce the self-refine and self-select losses, enabling the model to refine flawed rationale and derive the correct answer by comparing rationale candidates. Experiments on a wide range of vision-language tasks show that R3V consistently improves multimodal LLM reasoning, achieving a relative improvement of 23 to 60 percent over GPT-distilled baselines. Additionally, our approach supports self-reflection on generated solutions, further boosting performance through test-time computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating executable code from natural language instructions using Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges such as semantic ambiguity and understanding taskspecific contexts. To address these issues, we propose a system called DemoCraft, which enhances code generation by leveraging in-context learning and demonstration selection, combined with latent concept learning. Latent concept learning introduces additional concept tokens, which are trainable embeddings that capture task-specific knowledge. We then test our system on two major datasets: MBPP and Humaneval. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves an approximate 2x increase in the pass@k metric compared to baseline models. Furthermore, we introduce two novel evaluation metrics: correctness@k and similarity@k. Our empirical studies indicate that our system attains nearly a 3x improvement in these metrics as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting models mainly rely on historical numeric values to predict future outcomes.While these models have shown promising results, they often overlook the rich information available in other modalities, such as textual descriptions of special events, which can provide crucial insights into future dynamics.However, research that jointly incorporates text in time series forecasting remains relatively underexplored compared to other cross-modality work. Additionally, the modality gap between time series data and textual information poses a challenge for multimodal learning. To address this task, we propose Text2Freq, a cross-modality model that integrates text and time series data via the frequency domain. Specifically, our approach aligns textual information to the low-frequency components of time series data, establishing more effective and interpretable alignments between these two modalities. Our experiments on paired datasets of real-world stock prices and synthetic texts show that Text2Freq achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its adaptable architecture encouraging future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Identifying Implicit Social Biases in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models, like CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining), are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of multimodal retrieval tasks. However, prior work has shown that large language and deep vision models can learn historical biases contained in their training sets, leading to perpetuation of stereotypes and potential downstream harm. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the social biases that are present in CLIP, with a focus on the interaction between image and text modalities. We first propose a taxonomy of social biases called So-B-IT, which contains 374 words categorized across ten types of bias. Each type can lead to societal harm if associated with a particular demographic group. Using this taxonomy, we examine images retrieved by CLIP from a facial image dataset using each word as part of a prompt. We find that CLIP frequently displays undesirable associations between harmful words and specific demographic groups, such as retrieving mostly pictures of Middle Eastern men when asked to retrieve images of a "terrorist". Finally, we conduct an analysis of the source of such biases, by showing that the same harmful stereotypes are also present in a large image-text dataset used to train CLIP models for examples of biases that we find. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing bias in vision-language models, and suggest the need for transparency and fairness-aware curation of large pre-training datasets.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of length generalization in sequence prediction. We define a new metric of performance in this setting -- the Asymmetric-Regret -- which measures regret against a benchmark predictor with longer context length than available to the learner. We continue by studying this concept through the lens of the spectral filtering algorithm. We present a gradient-based learning algorithm that provably achieves length generalization for linear dynamical systems. We conclude with proof-of-concept experiments which are consistent with our theory.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Question Answering Precision with Optimized Vector Retrieval and Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question-answering (QA) is an important application of Information Retrieval (IR) and language models, and the latest trend is toward pre-trained large neural networks with embedding parameters. Augmenting QA performances with these LLMs requires intensive computational resources for fine-tuning. We propose an innovative approach to improve QA task performances by integrating optimized vector retrievals and instruction methodologies. Based on retrieval augmentation, the process involves document embedding, vector retrieval, and context construction for optimal QA results. We experiment with different combinations of text segmentation techniques and similarity functions, and analyze their impacts on QA performances. Results show that the model with a small chunk size of 100 without any overlap of the chunks achieves the best result and outperforms the models based on semantic segmentation using sentences. We discuss related QA examples and offer insight into how model performances are improved within the two-stage framework.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Text Classification: Mitigating Spurious Correlations with Causal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In text classification tasks, models often rely on spurious correlations for predictions, incorrectly associating irrelevant features with the target labels. This issue limits the robustness and generalization of models, especially when faced with out-of-distribution data where such spurious correlations no longer hold. To address this challenge, we propose the Causally Calibrated Robust Classifier (CCR), which aims to reduce models' reliance on spurious correlations and improve model robustness. Our approach integrates a causal feature selection method based on counterfactual reasoning, along with an unbiased inverse propensity weighting (IPW) loss function. By focusing on selecting causal features, we ensure that the model relies less on spurious features during prediction. We theoretically justify our approach and empirically show that CCR achieves state-of-the-art performance among methods without group labels, and in some cases, it can compete with the models that utilize group labels.</description>

      <title>Contrasting with Symile: Simple Model-Agnostic Representation Learning for Unlimited Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, leverage naturally paired data-for example, images and their corresponding text captions-to learn general representations that transfer efficiently to downstream tasks. While such approaches are generally applied to two modalities, domains such as robotics, healthcare, and video need to support many types of data at once. We show that the pairwise application of CLIP fails to capture joint information between modalities, thereby limiting the quality of the learned representations. To address this issue, we present Symile, a simple contrastive learning approach that captures higher-order information between any number of modalities. Symile provides a flexible, architecture-agnostic objective for learning modality-specific representations. To develop Symile's objective, we derive a lower bound on total correlation, and show that Symile representations for any set of modalities form a sufficient statistic for predicting the remaining modalities. Symile outperforms pairwise CLIP, even with modalities missing in the data, on cross-modal classification and retrieval across several experiments including on an original multilingual dataset of 33M image, text and audio samples and a clinical dataset of chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, and laboratory measurements. All datasets and code used in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/rajesh-lab/symile.</description>

      <title>Infant Agent: A Tool-Integrated, Logic-Driven Agent with Cost-Effective API Usage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they currently exhibit two primary limitations, \textbf{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 1}}: They struggle to \textbf{autonomously solve the real world engineering problem}. \textbf{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 2}}: They remain \textbf{challenged in reasoning through complex logic problems}. To address these challenges, we developed the \textsc{Infant Agent}, integrating task-aware functions, operators, a hierarchical management system, and a memory retrieval mechanism. Together, these components enable large language models to sustain extended reasoning processes and handle complex, multi-step tasks efficiently, all while significantly reducing API costs. Using the \textsc{Infant Agent}, GPT-4o's accuracy on the SWE-bench-lite dataset rises from $\mathbf{0.33\%}$ to $\mathbf{30\%}$, and in the AIME-2024 mathematics competition, it increases GPT-4o's accuracy from $\mathbf{13.3\%}$ to $\mathbf{37\%}$.</description>

      <title>Online and Offline Evaluations of Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are widely used AI applications designed to help users efficiently discover relevant items. The effectiveness of such systems is tied to the satisfaction of both users and providers. However, user satisfaction is complex and cannot be easily framed mathematically using information retrieval and accuracy metrics. While many studies evaluate accuracy through offline tests, a growing number of researchers argue that online evaluation methods such as A/B testing are better suited for this purpose. We have employed a variety of algorithms on different types of datasets divergent in size and subject, producing recommendations in various platforms, including media streaming services, digital publishing websites, e-commerce systems, and news broadcasting networks. Notably, our target websites and datasets are in Persian (Farsi) language.
  This study provides a comparative analysis of a large-scale recommender system that has been operating for the past year across about 70 websites in Iran, processing roughly 300 requests per second collectively. The system employs user-based and item-based recommendations using content-based, collaborative filtering, trend-based methods, and hybrid approaches. Through both offline and online evaluations, we aim to identify where these algorithms perform most efficiently and determine the best method for our specific needs, considering the dataset and system scale. Our methods of evaluation include manual evaluation, offline tests including accuracy and ranking metrics like hit-rate@k and nDCG, and online tests consisting of click-through rate (CTR). Additionally we analyzed and proposed methods to address cold-start and popularity bias.</description>

      <title>Classifier-guided Gradient Modulation for Enhanced Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has developed very fast in recent years. However, during the multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality based on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other modalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some limitations on the loss functions, optimizers and the number of modalities and only consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the directions of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel method to balance multimodal learning with Classifier-Guided Gradient Modulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the gradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets: UPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification, regression and segmentation tasks. The results show that CGGM outperforms all the baselines and other state-of-the-art methods consistently, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

      <title>DPCL-Diff: The Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning based on Graph Node Diffusion Model with Dual-Domain Periodic Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning that infers future missing facts is an essential and challenging task. Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Alignment for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study methods for efficiently aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences given budgeted online feedback. We first formulate the LLM alignment problem in the frame of contextual dueling bandits. This formulation, subsuming recent paradigms such as online RLHF and online DPO, inherently quests for sample-efficient algorithms that incorporate online active exploration. Leveraging insights from bandit theory, we introduce a unified algorithm based on Thompson sampling and highlight its applications in two distinct LLM alignment scenarios. The practical agent that efficiently implements this algorithm, named SEA (Sample-Efficient Alignment), is empirically validated through extensive experiments across three model scales (1B, 2.8B, 6.9B) and three preference learning algorithms (DPO, IPO, SLiC). The results demonstrate that SEA achieves highly sample-efficient alignment with oracle's preferences, outperforming recent active exploration methods for LLMs. Additionally, we release the implementation of SEA together with an efficient codebase designed for online alignment of LLMs, aiming to accelerate future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Integration of Large Vision Language Models for Efficient Post-disaster Damage Assessment and Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a new avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, the first multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core model, DisasTeller autonomously implements disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and optimising resource distribution. Our evaluations through both LVLMs and humans demonstrate DisasTeller's effectiveness in streamlining disaster response. This framework not only supports expert teams but also simplifies access to disaster management processes for non-experts, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and LVLM-driven efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ontology Population using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly utilized for data integration, representation, and visualization. While KG population is critical, it is often costly, especially when data must be extracted from unstructured text in natural language, which presents challenges, such as ambiguity and complex interpretations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for such tasks, excelling in natural language understanding and content generation. However, their tendency to ``hallucinate'' can produce inaccurate outputs. Despite these limitations, LLMs offer rapid and scalable processing of natural language data, and with prompt engineering and fine-tuning, they can approximate human-level performance in extracting and structuring data for KGs. This study investigates LLM effectiveness for the KG population, focusing on the Enslaved.org Hub Ontology. In this paper, we report that compared to the ground truth, LLM's can extract ~90% of triples, when provided a modular ontology as guidance in the prompts.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Microservices Architecture for Dynamic Pricing in the Travel Industry: Algorithms, Scalability, and Impact on Revenue and Customer Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the implementation of a real-time, microservices-oriented dynamic pricing system for the travel sector. The system is designed to address factors such as demand, competitor pricing, and other external circumstances in real-time. Both controlled simulation and real-life application showed a respectable gain of 22% in revenue generation and a 17% improvement in pricing response time which concern the issues of scaling and flexibility of classical pricing mechanisms. Demand forecasting, competitor pricing strategies, and event-based pricing were implemented as separate microservices to enhance their scalability and reduce resource consumption by 30% during peak loads. Customers were also more content as depicted by a 15% increase in satisfaction score post-implementation given the appreciation of more appropriate pricing. This research enhances the existing literature with practical illustrations of the possible application of microservices technology in developing dynamic pricing solutions in a complex and data-driven context. There exist however areas for improvement for instance inter-service latency and the need for extensive real-time data pipelines. The present research goes on to suggest combining these with direct data capture from customer behavior at the same time as machine learning capacity developments in pricing algorithms to assist in more accurate real time pricing. It is determined that the use of microservices is a reasonable and efficient model for dynamic pricing, allowing the tourism sector to employ evidence-based and customer centric pricing techniques, which ensures that their profits are not jeopardized because of the need for customers.</description>

      <title>EcoAct: Economic Agent Determines When to Register What Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as agents that can perform actions using external tools. This requires registering, i.e., integrating tool information into the LLM context prior to taking actions. Current methods indiscriminately incorporate all candidate tools into the agent's context and retain them across multiple reasoning steps. This process remains opaque to LLM agents and is not integrated into their reasoning procedures, leading to inefficiencies due to increased context length from irrelevant tools. To address this, we introduce EcoAct, a tool using algorithm that allows LLMs to selectively register tools as needed, optimizing context use. By integrating the tool registration process into the reasoning procedure, EcoAct reduces computational costs by over 50% in multiple steps reasoning tasks while maintaining performance, as demonstrated through extensive experiments. Moreover, it can be plugged into any reasoning pipeline with only minor modifications to the prompt, making it applicable to LLM agents now and future.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Medical Datasets with Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of using training dynamics as an automated alternative to human annotation for evaluating the quality of training data. The framework used is Data Maps, which classifies data points into categories such as easy-to-learn, hard-to-learn, and ambiguous (Swayamdipta et al., 2020). Swayamdipta et al. (2020) highlight that difficult-to-learn examples often contain errors, and ambiguous cases significantly impact model training. To confirm the reliability of these findings, we replicated the experiments using a challenging dataset, with a focus on medical question answering. In addition to text comprehension, this field requires the acquisition of detailed medical knowledge, which further complicates the task. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to assess the feasibility and transferability of the Data Maps framework to the medical domain. The evaluation indicates that the framework is unsuitable for addressing datasets' unique challenges in answering medical questions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Theory Behind Scaling 1-Bit Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, showcasing an impressive combination of efficiency and performance that rivals traditional LLMs. Research by Wang et al. (2023); Ma et al. (2024) indicates that the performance of these 1-bit LLMs progressively improves as the number of parameters increases, hinting at the potential existence of a Scaling Law for 1-bit Neural Networks. In this paper, we present the first theoretical result that rigorously establishes this scaling law for 1-bit models. We prove that, despite the constraint of weights restricted to $\{-1, +1\}$, the dynamics of model training inevitably align with kernel behavior as the network width grows. This theoretical breakthrough guarantees convergence of the 1-bit model to an arbitrarily small loss as width increases. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the generalization difference, defined as the gap between the outputs of 1-bit networks and their full-precision counterparts, and demonstrate that this difference maintains a negligible level as network width scales. Building on the work of Kaplan et al. (2020), we conclude by examining how the training loss scales as a power-law function of the model size, dataset size, and computational resources utilized for training. Our findings underscore the promising potential of scaling 1-bit neural networks, suggesting that int1 could become the standard in future neural network precision.</description>

      <title>Data Extraction Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with providing accurate answers when lacking domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge bases, but it also introduces new attack surfaces. In this paper, we investigate data extraction attacks targeting the knowledge databases of RAG systems. We demonstrate that previous attacks on RAG largely depend on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, and that simple fine-tuning can reduce the success rate of such attacks to nearly zero. This makes these attacks impractical since fine-tuning is a common practice when deploying LLMs in specific domains. To further reveal the vulnerability, we propose to backdoor RAG, where a small portion of poisoned data is injected during the fine-tuning phase to create a backdoor within the LLM. When this compromised LLM is integrated into a RAG system, attackers can exploit specific triggers in prompts to manipulate the LLM to leak documents from the retrieval database. By carefully designing the poisoned data, we achieve both verbatim and paraphrased document extraction. We show that with only 3\% poisoned data, our method achieves an average success rate of 79.7\% in verbatim extraction on Llama2-7B, with a ROUGE-L score of 64.21, and a 68.6\% average success rate in paraphrased extraction, with an average ROUGE score of 52.6 across four datasets. These results underscore the privacy risks associated with the supply chain when deploying RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Weight Decay for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimizers such as AdamW, equipped with momentum and adaptive learning rate, are designed to escape local minima and explore the vast parameter space. This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

      <title>Leveraging Label Semantics and Meta-Label Refinement for Multi-Label Question Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate annotation of educational resources is critical in the rapidly advancing field of online education due to the complexity and volume of content. Existing classification methods face challenges with semantic overlap and distribution imbalance of labels in the multi-label context, which impedes effective personalized learning and resource recommendation. This paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method To multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. Firstly, RR2QC leverages semantic relationships within and across label groups to enhance pre-training strategie in multi-label context. Next, a class center learning task is introduced, integrating label texts into downstream training to ensure questions consistently align with label semantics, retrieving the most relevant label sequences. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and trains a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels frequently appearing in other labels. Addtionally, a Math LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results demonstrate that RR2QC outperforms existing classification methods in Precision@k and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, establishing it as a potent enhancement for online educational content utilization.</description>

      <title>Grounding Emotional Descriptions to Electrovibration Haptic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing and displaying haptic signals with sensory and emotional attributes can improve the user experience in various applications. Free-form user language provides rich sensory and emotional information for haptic design (e.g., ``This signal feels smooth and exciting''), but little work exists on linking user descriptions to haptic signals (i.e., language grounding). To address this gap, we conducted a study where 12 users described the feel of 32 signals perceived on a surface haptics (i.e., electrovibration) display. We developed a computational pipeline using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and word embedding methods, to extract sensory and emotional keywords and group them into semantic clusters (i.e., concepts). We linked the keyword clusters to haptic signal features (e.g., pulse count) using correlation analysis. The proposed pipeline demonstrates the viability of a computational approach to analyzing haptic experiences. We discuss our future plans for creating a predictive model of haptic experience.</description>

      <title>Improving Steering Vectors by Targeting Sparse Autoencoder Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To control the behavior of language models, steering methods attempt to ensure that outputs of the model satisfy specific pre-defined properties. Adding steering vectors to the model is a promising method of model control that is easier than finetuning, and may be more robust than prompting. However, it can be difficult to anticipate the effects of steering vectors produced by almost all existing methods, such as CAA (Panickssery et al., 2024) or the direct use of SAE latents (Templeton et al., 2024). In our work, we address this issue by using SAEs to measure the effects of steering vectors, giving us a method that can be used to understand the causal effect of any steering vector intervention. We use this method for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method, SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects. We show that overall, SAE-TS balances steering effects with coherence better than CAA and SAE feature steering, when evaluated on a range of tasks.</description>

      <title>The Role of DevOps in Enhancing Enterprise Software Delivery Success through R&amp;D Efficiency and Source Code Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of DevOps practices on enterprise software delivery success, focusing on enhancing R&amp;D efficiency and source code management (SCM). Using a qualitative methodology, data were collected from case studies of large-scale enterprises implementing DevOps to explore how these practices streamline software development processes. Findings reveal that DevOps significantly improves R&amp;D productivity by fostering cross-functional collaboration, reducing development cycle times, and enhancing software quality through effective SCM practices, such as version control and continuous integration. Additionally, SCM tools within DevOps enable precise change tracking and reliable code maintenance, further supporting faster, more robust software delivery. However, the study identifies challenges, including cultural resistance and tool integration issues, that can hinder DevOps implementation. Additionally, This research contributes to the growing body of DevOps literature by highlighting the role of R&amp;D efficiency and SCM as crucial factors for software delivery success. Future studies should investigate these factors across diverse industries to validate findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC, a highly diverse dataset of abstract reasoning tasks. We train neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). Our models are trained on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs to produce Python code specifying a function to be inferred, plus a stochastic subroutine for generating inputs to that function. We find inductive and transductive models solve very different problems, despite training on the same problems, and despite sharing the same neural architecture.</description>

      <title>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Seq-VCR: Preventing Collapse in Intermediate Transformer Representations for Enhanced Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only Transformers often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly arithmetic reasoning requiring multiple sequential operations. In this work, we identify representation collapse in the model's intermediate layers as a key factor limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose Sequential Variance-Covariance Regularization (Seq-VCR), which enhances the entropy of intermediate representations and prevents collapse. Combined with dummy pause tokens as substitutes for chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens, our method significantly improves performance in arithmetic reasoning problems. In the challenging $5 \times 5$ integer multiplication task, our approach achieves $99.5\%$ exact match accuracy, outperforming models of the same size (which yield $0\%$ accuracy) and GPT-4 with five-shot CoT prompting ($44\%$). We also demonstrate superior results on arithmetic expression and longest increasing subsequence (LIS) datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing intermediate layer representation collapse to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Transformers and show that Seq-VCR offers an effective solution without requiring explicit CoT supervision.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models generalize analogy solving like people can?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we solve an analogy we transfer information from a known context to a new one through abstract rules and relational similarity. In people, the ability to solve analogies such as "body : feet :: table : ?" emerges in childhood, and appears to transfer easily to other domains, such as the visual domain "( : ) :: &lt; : ?". Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training a code-switching end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model normally requires a large amount of data, while code-switching data is often limited. In this paper, three novel approaches are proposed for code-switching data augmentation. Specifically, they are audio splicing with the existing code-switching data, and TTS with new code-switching texts generated by word translation or word insertion. Our experiments on 200 hours Mandarin-English code-switching dataset show that all the three proposed approaches yield significant improvements on code-switching ASR individually. Moreover, all the proposed approaches can be combined with recent popular SpecAugment, and an addition gain can be obtained. WER is significantly reduced by relative 24.0% compared to the system without any data augmentation, and still relative 13.0% gain compared to the system with only SpecAugment</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Authorship Style Transfer: Can Non-Famous Authors Be Imitated?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Authorship style transfer involves altering text to match the style of a target author whilst preserving the original meaning. Existing unsupervised approaches like STRAP have largely focused on style transfer to target authors with many examples of their writing style in books, speeches, or other published works. This high-resource training data requirement (often greater than 100,000 words) makes these approaches primarily useful for style transfer to published authors, politicians, or other well-known figures and authorship styles, while style transfer to non-famous authors has not been well-studied. We introduce the low-resource authorship style transfer task, a more challenging class of authorship style transfer where only a limited amount of text in the target author's style may exist. In our experiments, we specifically choose source and target authors from Reddit and style transfer their Reddit posts, limiting ourselves to just 16 posts (on average ~500 words) of the target author's style. Style transfer accuracy is typically measured by how often a classifier or human judge will classify an output as written by the target author. Recent authorship representations models excel at authorship identification even with just a few writing samples, making automatic evaluation of this task possible for the first time through evaluation metrics we propose. Our results establish an in-context learning technique we develop as the strongest baseline, though we find current approaches do not yet achieve mastery of this challenging task. We release our data and implementations to encourage further investigation.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Temporal Question Answering for Large Language Models with Tailor-Made Reasoning Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temporal aspect is a significant dimension of our reality. We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>GestureGPT: Toward Zero-Shot Free-Form Hand Gesture Understanding with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12821v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing gesture interfaces only work with a fixed set of gestures defined either by interface designers or by users themselves, which introduces learning or demonstration efforts that diminish their naturalness. Humans, on the other hand, understand free-form gestures by synthesizing the gesture, context, experience, and common sense. In this way, the user does not need to learn, demonstrate, or associate gestures. We introduce GestureGPT, a free-form hand gesture understanding framework that mimics human gesture understanding procedures to enable a natural free-form gestural interface. Our framework leverages multiple Large Language Model agents to manage and synthesize gesture and context information, then infers the interaction intent by associating the gesture with an interface function. More specifically, our triple-agent framework includes a Gesture Description Agent that automatically segments and formulates natural language descriptions of hand poses and movements based on hand landmark coordinates. The description is deciphered by a Gesture Inference Agent through self-reasoning and querying about the interaction context (e.g., interaction history, gaze data), which is managed by a Context Management Agent. Following iterative exchanges, the Gesture Inference Agent discerns the user's intent by grounding it to an interactive function. We validated our framework offline under two real-world scenarios: smart home control and online video streaming. The average zero-shot Top-1/Top-5 grounding accuracies are 44.79%/83.59% for smart home tasks and 37.50%/73.44% for video streaming tasks. We also provide an extensive discussion that includes rationale for model selection, generalizability, and future research directions for a practical system etc.</description>

      <title>Experimental Narratives: A Comparison of Human Crowdsourced Storytelling and AI Storytelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a framework that combines behavioral and computational experiments employing fictional prompts as a novel tool for investigating cultural artifacts and social biases in storytelling both by humans and generative AI. The study analyzes 250 stories authored by crowdworkers in June 2019 and 80 stories generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in March 2023 by merging methods from narratology and inferential statistics. Both crowdworkers and large language models responded to identical prompts about creating and falling in love with an artificial human. The proposed experimental paradigm allows a direct and controlled comparison between human and LLM-generated storytelling. Responses to the Pygmalionesque prompts confirm the pervasive presence of the Pygmalion myth in the collective imaginary of both humans and large language models. All solicited narratives present a scientific or technological pursuit. The analysis reveals that narratives from GPT-3.5 and particularly GPT-4 are more progressive in terms of gender roles and sexuality than those written by humans. While AI narratives with default settings and no additional prompting can occasionally provide innovative plot twists, they offer less imaginative scenarios and rhetoric than human-authored texts. The proposed framework argues that fiction can be used as a window into human and AI-based collective imaginary and social dimensions.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Engineering Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We describe a method, based on Jennifer Nado's proposal for classification procedures as targets of conceptual engineering, that implements such procedures by prompting a large language model. We apply this method, using data from the Wikidata knowledge graph, to evaluate stipulative definitions related to two paradigmatic conceptual engineering projects: the International Astronomical Union's redefinition of PLANET and Haslanger's ameliorative analysis of WOMAN. Our results show that classification procedures built using our approach can exhibit good classification performance and, through the generation of rationales for their classifications, can contribute to the identification of issues in either the definitions or the data against which they are being evaluated. We consider objections to this method, and discuss implications of this work for three aspects of theory and practice of conceptual engineering: the definition of its targets, empirical methods for their investigation, and their practical roles. The data and code used for our experiments, together with the experimental results, are available in a Github repository.</description>

      <title>HuRef: HUman-REadable Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In this study, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public. We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient condition to identify the base model. The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef.</description>

      <title>CMMMU: A Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11944v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) continue to advance, evaluating the performance of LMMs emerges as an increasing need. Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU. CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art &amp; Design, Business, Science, Health &amp; Medicine, Humanities &amp; Social Science, and Tech &amp; Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. CMMMU focuses on complex perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge in the Chinese context. We evaluate 11 open-source LLMs and one proprietary GPT-4V(ision). Even GPT-4V only achieves accuracies of 42%, indicating a large space for improvement. CMMMU will boost the community to build the next-generation LMMs towards expert artificial intelligence and promote the democratization of LMMs by providing diverse language contexts.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in chemical research. However, most models currently used in chemistry are specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing, showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities. However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue. Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference. We have open-sourced the inference codes, evaluation datasets, and model weights of ChemDFM on Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/ChemDFM-13B-v1.0).</description>

      <title>Aligner: Efficient Alignment by Learning to Correct</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02416v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving practical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has never been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9% in helpfulness and 23.8% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking Aligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0% to 58.3%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).</description>

Abstract: Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models. We release our code, models, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset under a commercially permissive license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA show promise in medical applications, yet challenges remain in medical language comprehension. This study presents Me-LLaMA, a new medical LLM family based on open-source LLaMA models, optimized for medical text analysis and diagnosis by leveraging large-scale, domain-specific datasets. The Me-LLaMA family, including foundation models Me-LLaMA 13/70B and their chat-enhanced versions, was developed through continued pre-training and instruction tuning with 129B tokens and 214K samples from biomedical and clinical sources. Training the 70B models required over 100,000 A100 GPU hours. Me-LLaMA's performance was evaluated across six medical text analysis tasks using 12 benchmark datasets and complex clinical case diagnosis, with automatic and human evaluations. Results indicate Me-LLaMA outperforms LLaMA and other open-source medical LLMs in zero-shot and supervised settings. Task-specific tuning further boosts performance, surpassing ChatGPT on 7 of 8 datasets and GPT-4 on 5 of 8. For complex clinical cases, Me-LLaMA achieves performance comparable to ChatGPT and GPT-4. This work underscores the importance of domain-specific data in developing medical LLMs and addresses the high computational costs involved in training, highlighting a balance between pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Me-LLaMA models are now accessible under user agreements, providing a valuable resource for advancing medical AI.</description>

      <title>DREsS: Dataset for Rubric-based Essay Scoring on EFL Writing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%. DREsS will enable further research to provide a more accurate and practical AES system for EFL writing education.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AmbigNLG, a novel task designed to tackle the challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for Natural Language Generation (NLG). Ambiguous instructions often impede the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in complex NLG tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose an ambiguity taxonomy that categorizes different types of instruction ambiguities and refines initial instructions with clearer specifications. Accompanying this task, we present AmbigSNI-NLG, a dataset comprising 2,500 instances annotated to facilitate research in AmbigNLG. Through comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the alignment of generated text with user expectations, achieving up to a 15.02-point increase in ROUGE scores. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing task ambiguity to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs in NLG tasks. Furthermore, we confirm the effectiveness of our method in practical settings involving interactive ambiguity mitigation with users, underscoring the benefits of leveraging LLMs for interactive clarification.</description>

      <title>ERBench: An Entity-Relationship based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.</description>

      <title>StreamingDialogue: Prolonged Dialogue Learning via Long Context Compression with Minimal Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with handling dialogues with long contexts due to efficiency and consistency issues. According to our observation, dialogue contexts are highly structured, and the special token of \textit{End-of-Utterance} (EoU) in dialogues has the potential to aggregate information. We refer to the EoU tokens as ``conversational attention sinks'' (conv-attn sinks). Accordingly, we introduce StreamingDialogue, which compresses long dialogue history into conv-attn sinks with minimal losses, and thus reduces computational complexity quadratically with the number of sinks (i.e., the number of utterances). Current LLMs already demonstrate the ability to handle long context window, e.g., a window size of 200K or more. To this end, by compressing utterances into EoUs, our method has the potential to handle more than 200K of utterances, resulting in a prolonged dialogue learning. In order to minimize information losses from reconstruction after compression, we design two learning strategies of short-memory reconstruction (SMR) and long-memory reactivation (LMR). Our method outperforms strong baselines in dialogue tasks and achieves a 4 $\times$ speedup while reducing memory usage by 18 $\times$ compared to dense attention recomputation.</description>

      <title>RetinaQA: A Robust Knowledge Base Question Answering Model for both Answerable and Unanswerable Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An essential requirement for a real-world Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) system is the ability to detect the answerability of questions when generating logical forms. However, state-of-the-art KBQA models assume all questions to be answerable. Recent research has found that such models, when superficially adapted to detect answerability, struggle to satisfactorily identify the different categories of unanswerable questions, and simultaneously preserve good performance for answerable questions. Towards addressing this issue, we propose RetinaQA, a new KBQA model that unifies two key ideas in a single KBQA architecture: (a) discrimination over candidate logical forms, rather than generating these, for handling schema-related unanswerability, and (b) sketch-filling-based construction of candidate logical forms for handling data-related unaswerability. Our results show that RetinaQA significantly outperforms adaptations of state-of-the-art KBQA models in handling both answerable and unanswerable questions and demonstrates robustness across all categories of unanswerability. Notably, RetinaQA also sets a new state-of-the-art for answerable KBQA, surpassing existing models.</description>

      <title>Monotonic Paraphrasing Improves Generalization of Language Model Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance of large language models (LLMs) may vary with different prompts or instructions of even the same task. One commonly recognized factor for this phenomenon is the model's familiarity with the given prompt or instruction, which is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt with the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible prompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara), an end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions into their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase LM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or instruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The ensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt without altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decreasing the perplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore in detail both greedy and search-based decoding as two alternative decoding schemes of MonoPara. Notably, MonoPara does not require any training and can monotonically lower the perplexity of the paraphrased prompt or instruction, leading to improved performance of zero-shot LM prompting as evaluated on a wide selection of tasks. In addition, MonoPara is also shown to effectively improve LMs' generalization on perturbed and unseen task instructions.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Blind Spots of Language Models with Targeted Agent-in-the-Loop Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) have achieved impressive accuracy across a variety of tasks but remain vulnerable to high-confidence misclassifications, also referred to as unknown unknowns (UUs). These UUs cluster into blind spots in the feature space, leading to significant risks in high-stakes applications. This is particularly relevant for smaller, lightweight LMs that are more susceptible to such errors. While the identification of UUs has been extensively studied, their mitigation remains an open challenge, including how to use identified UUs to eliminate unseen blind spots. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address blind spot mitigation through the use of intelligent agents -- either humans or large LMs -- as teachers to characterize UU-type errors. By leveraging the generalization capabilities of intelligent agents, we identify patterns in high-confidence misclassifications and use them to generate targeted synthetic samples to improve model robustness and reduce blind spots. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our method on three classification tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of UUs, all while maintaining a similar level of accuracy. We find that the effectiveness of human computation has a high ceiling but is highly dependent on familiarity with the underlying task. Moreover, the cost gap between humans and LMs surpasses an order of magnitude, as LMs attain human-like generalization and generation performance while being more scalable.</description>

      <title>COIG-CQIA: Quality is All You Need for Chinese Instruction Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkable progress on English instruction tuning has facilitated the efficacy and reliability of large language models (LLMs). However, there remains a noticeable gap in instruction tuning for Chinese, where the complex linguistic features pose significant challenges. Existing datasets, generally distilled from English-centric LLMs, are not well-aligned with Chinese users' interaction patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce COIG-CQIA, a new Chinese instruction tuning dataset derived from various real-world resources and undergoing rigorous human verification. We conduct extensive experiments on COIG-CQIA, and compare them with strong baseline models and datasets. The experimental results show that models trained on COIG-CQIA achieve highly competitive performance in diverse benchmarks. Additionally, our findings offer several insights for designing effective Chinese instruction-tuning datasets and data-mixing strategies. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/COIG-CQIA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00297v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion and consumer behavior. Existing models face challenges with linguistic diversity, generalizability, and explainability. We propose TRABSA, a hybrid framework integrating transformer-based architectures, attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM networks to address this. Leveraging RoBERTa-trained on 124M tweets, we bridge gaps in sentiment analysis benchmarks, ensuring state-of-the-art accuracy. Augmenting datasets with tweets from 32 countries and US states, we compare six word-embedding techniques and three lexicon-based labeling techniques, selecting the best for optimal sentiment analysis. TRABSA outperforms traditional ML and deep learning models with 94% accuracy and significant precision, recall, and F1-score gains. Evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates consistent superiority and generalizability. SHAP and LIME analyses enhance interpretability, improving confidence in predictions. Our study facilitates pandemic resource management, aiding resource planning, policy formation, and vaccination tactics.</description>

Abstract: Topic modeling is a widely used approach for analyzing and exploring large document collections. Recent research efforts have incorporated pre-trained contextualized language models, such as BERT embeddings, into topic modeling. However, they often neglect the intrinsic informational value conveyed by mutual dependencies between words. In this study, we introduce GINopic, a topic modeling framework based on graph isomorphism networks to capture the correlation between words. By conducting intrinsic (quantitative as well as qualitative) and extrinsic evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GINopic compared to existing topic models and highlight its potential for advancing topic modeling.</description>

      <title>NALA: an Effective and Interpretable Entity Alignment Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims to find equivalent entities between two Knowledge Graphs. Existing embedding-based EA methods usually encode entities as embeddings, triples as embeddings' constraint and learn to align the embeddings. However, the details of the underlying logical inference steps among the alignment process are usually omitted, resulting in inadequate inference process. In this paper, we introduce NALA, an entity alignment method that captures three types of logical inference paths with Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL). Type 1&amp;2 align the entity pairs and type 3 aligns relations. NALA iteratively aligns entities and relations by integrating the conclusions of the inference paths. Our method is logically interpretable and extensible by introducing NAL, and thus suitable for various EA settings. Experimental results show that NALA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hits@1, achieving 0.98+ on all three datasets of DBP15K with both supervised and unsupervised settings. We offer a pioneering in-depth analysis of the fundamental principles of entity alignment, approaching the subject from a unified and logical perspective. Our code is available at https://github.com/13998151318/NALA.</description>

      <title>Spectral Editing of Activations for Large Language Model Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviours, such as generating untruthful or biased content. Editing their internal representations has been shown to be effective in mitigating such behaviours on top of the existing alignment methods. We propose a novel inference-time editing method, namely spectral editing of activations (SEA), to project the input representations into directions with maximal covariance with the positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) while minimising covariance with the negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinated). We also extend our method to non-linear editing using feature functions. We run extensive experiments on benchmarks concerning truthfulness and bias with six open-source LLMs of different sizes and model families. The results demonstrate the superiority of SEA in effectiveness, generalisation to similar tasks, as well as computation and data efficiency. We also show that SEA editing only has a limited negative impact on other model capabilities.</description>

      <title>MHPP: Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of Language Models Beyond Basic Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved code generation, specifically at the function level. For instance, GPT-4o has achieved a 91.0\% pass rate on HumanEval. However, this draws into question the adequacy of existing benchmarks in thoroughly assessing function-level code generation capabilities. Our study analyzed two common benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and found that these might not thoroughly evaluate LLMs' code generation capacities due to limitations in quality, difficulty, and granularity. To resolve this, we introduce the Mostly Hard Python Problems (MHPP) dataset, consisting of 210 unique human-curated problems. By focusing on the combination of natural language and code reasoning, MHPP gauges LLMs' abilities to comprehend specifications and restrictions, engage in multi-step reasoning, and apply coding knowledge effectively. Initial evaluations of 26 LLMs using MHPP showed many high-performing models on HumanEval failed to achieve similar success on MHPP. Moreover, MHPP highlighted various previously undiscovered limitations within various LLMs, leading us to believe that it could pave the way for a better understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations. MHPP, evaluation pipeline, and leaderboard can be found in https://github.com/SparksofAGI/MHPP.</description>

      <title>Unchosen Experts Can Contribute Too: Unleashing MoE Models' Power by Self-Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a prominent architecture for scaling model size while maintaining computational efficiency. In MoE, each token in the input sequence activates a different subset of experts determined by a routing mechanism. However, the unchosen experts in MoE models do not contribute to the output, potentially leading to underutilization of the model's capacity. In this work, we first conduct exploratory studies to demonstrate that increasing the number of activated experts does not necessarily improve and can even degrade the output quality. Then, we show that output distributions from an MoE model using different routing strategies substantially differ, indicating that different experts do not always act synergistically. Motivated by these findings, we propose Self-Contrast Mixture-of-Experts (SCMoE), a training-free strategy that utilizes unchosen experts in a self-contrast manner during inference. In SCMoE, the next-token probabilities are determined by contrasting the outputs from strong and weak activation using the same MoE model. Our method is conceptually simple and computationally lightweight, as it incurs minimal latency compared to greedy decoding. Experiments on several benchmarks (GSM8K, StrategyQA, MBPP and HumanEval) demonstrate that SCMoE can consistently enhance Mixtral 8x7B's reasoning capability across various domains. For example, it improves the accuracy on GSM8K from 61.79 to 66.94. Moreover, combining SCMoE with self-consistency yields additional gains, increasing major@20 accuracy from 75.59 to 78.31.</description>

      <title>SimPO: Simple Preference Optimization with a Reference-Free Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used offline preference optimization algorithm that reparameterizes reward functions in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance simplicity and training stability. In this work, we propose SimPO, a simpler yet more effective approach. The effectiveness of SimPO is attributed to a key design: using the average log probability of a sequence as the implicit reward. This reward formulation better aligns with model generation and eliminates the need for a reference model, making it more compute and memory efficient. Additionally, we introduce a target reward margin to the Bradley-Terry objective to encourage a larger margin between the winning and losing responses, further improving the algorithm's performance. We compare SimPO to DPO and its latest variants across various state-of-the-art training setups, including both base and instruction-tuned models such as Mistral, Llama 3, and Gemma 2. We evaluate on extensive chat-based evaluation benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard. Our results demonstrate that SimPO consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches without substantially increasing response length. Specifically, SimPO outperforms DPO by up to 6.4 points on AlpacaEval 2 and by up to 7.5 points on Arena-Hard. Our top-performing model, built on Gemma-2-9B-it, achieves a 72.4% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2, a 59.1% win rate on Arena-Hard, and ranks 1st on Chatbot Arena among &lt;10B models with real user votes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason via Program Generation, Emulation, and Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Program synthesis with language models (LMs) has unlocked a large set of reasoning abilities; code-tuned LMs have proven adept at generating programs that solve a wide variety of algorithmic symbolic manipulation tasks (e.g. word concatenation). However, not all reasoning tasks are easily expressible as code, e.g. tasks involving commonsense reasoning, moral decision-making, and sarcasm understanding. Our goal is to extend an LM's program synthesis skills to such tasks and evaluate the results via pseudo-programs, namely Python programs where some leaf function calls are left undefined. To that end, we propose, Code Generation and Emulated EXecution (CoGEX). CoGEX works by (1) training LMs to generate pseudo-programs, (2) teaching them to emulate their generated program's execution, including those leaf functions, allowing the LM's knowledge to fill in the execution gaps; and (3) using them to search over many programs to find an optimal one. To adapt the CoGEX model to a new task, we introduce a method for performing program search to find a single program whose pseudo-execution yields optimal performance when applied to all the instances of a given dataset. We show that our approach yields large improvements compared to standard in-context learning approaches on a battery of tasks, both algorithmic and soft reasoning. This result thus demonstrates that code synthesis can be applied to a much broader class of problems than previously considered. Our released dataset, fine-tuned models, and implementation can be found at \url{https://github.com/nweir127/CoGEX}.</description>

Abstract: Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly complex problems. Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area. We also maintain a GitHub repository to continually keep track of the relevant papers and resources in this rising area at https://github.com/quchangle1/LLM-Tool-Survey.</description>

      <title>fMRI predictors based on language models of increasing complexity recover brain left lateralization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, studies of naturalistic language processing where participants are scanned while listening to continuous text have flourished. Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, although this effect is present in both hemispheres, it is stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere. Specifically, the left-right difference in brain correlation follows a scaling law with the number of parameters. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.</description>

Abstract: Developing intelligent pediatric consultation systems offers promising prospects for improving diagnostic efficiency, especially in China, where healthcare resources are scarce. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in pediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable training procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus, a high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric textbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse diagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the first Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training pipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid instruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge inconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the full-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the general medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a direct following preference optimization to enhance the generation of pediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary SFT phase, a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to resolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric expertise mastery. Extensive results based on the metrics, GPT-4, and doctor evaluations on distinct doctor downstream tasks show that PediatricsGPT consistently outperforms previous Chinese medical LLMs. Our model and dataset will be open-source for community development.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer Meets Consensus: Unleashing the Power of Functions in Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress made by large language models in code generation, they still struggle with programs that meet complex requirements. Recent work utilizes plan-and-solve decomposition to decrease the complexity and leverage self-tests to refine the generated program. Yet, planning deep-inside requirements in advance can be challenging, and the tests need to be accurate to accomplish self-improvement. To this end, we propose FunCoder, a code generation framework incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus. Specifically, FunCoder recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior, mitigating error propagation. FunCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, our method demonstrates superiority on smaller models: With FunCoder, StableCode-3b surpasses GPT-3.5 by +18.6% and achieves 97.7% of GPT-4's performance on HumanEval. Further analysis reveals that our proposed dynamic function decomposition is capable of handling complex requirements, and the functional consensus prevails over self-testing in correctness evaluation.</description>

      <title>BoNBoN Alignment for Large Language Models and the Sweetness of Best-of-n Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of aligning samples from large language models to human preferences using best-of-$n$ sampling, where we draw $n$ samples, rank them, and return the best one. We consider two fundamental problems. First: what is the relationship between best-of-$n$ and approaches to alignment that train LLMs to output samples with a high expected reward (e.g., RLHF or DPO)? To answer this, we embed both the best-of-$n$ distribution and the sampling distributions learned by alignment procedures in a common class of tiltings of the base LLM distribution. We then show that, within this class, best-of-$n$ is essentially optimal in terms of the trade-off between win-rate against the base model vs KL distance from the base model. That is, best-of-$n$ is the best choice of alignment distribution if the goal is to maximize win rate. However, best-of-$n$ requires drawing $n$ samples for each inference, a substantial cost. To avoid this, the second problem we consider is how to fine-tune a LLM to mimic the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution. We derive BoNBoN Alignment to achieve this by exploiting the special structure of the best-of-$n$ distribution. Experiments show that BoNBoN alignment yields substantial improvements in producing a model that is preferred to the base policy while minimally affecting off-target aspects.</description>

      <title>CERET: Cost-Effective Extrinsic Refinement for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful models for generation tasks, but they may not generate good quality outputs in their first attempt. Apart from model fine-tuning, existing approaches to improve prediction accuracy and quality typically involve LLM self-improvement / self-reflection that incorporate feedback from models themselves. Despite their effectiveness, these methods are hindered by their high computational cost and lack of scalability. In this work, we propose CERET, a method for refining text generations by considering semantic stability, entailment and inter-sample uncertainty measures. Experimental results show that CERET outperforms Self-consistency and Self-rerank baselines consistently under various task setups, by ~1.6% in Rouge-1 for abstractive summarization and ~3.5% in hit rate for question answering. Compared to LLM Self-rerank method, our approach only requires 9.4% of its latency and is more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Talking Heads: Understanding Inter-layer Communication in Transformer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used in two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that it underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval behaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later layers, forming low-rank communication channels (Elhage et al., 2021) between layers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed to positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct information from context when many items ``crowd" this limited space. By decomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models can memorize and repeat their training data, causing privacy and copyright risks. To mitigate memorization, we introduce a subtle modification to the next-token training objective that we call the goldfish loss. During training, randomly sampled subsets of tokens are excluded from the loss computation. These dropped tokens are not memorized by the model, which prevents verbatim reproduction of a complete chain of tokens from the training set. We run extensive experiments training billion-scale Llama-2 models, both pre-trained and trained from scratch, and demonstrate significant reductions in extractable memorization with little to no impact on downstream benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with General-domain Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training a neural network-based biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) model usually requires extensive and costly human annotations. While several studies have employed multi-task learning with multiple BioNER datasets to reduce human effort, this approach does not consistently yield performance improvements and may introduce label ambiguity in different biomedical corpora. We aim to tackle those challenges through transfer learning from easily accessible resources with fewer concept overlaps with biomedical datasets. In this paper, we proposed GERBERA, a simple-yet-effective method that utilized a general-domain NER dataset for training. Specifically, we performed multi-task learning to train a pre-trained biomedical language model with both the target BioNER dataset and the general-domain dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the models specifically for the BioNER dataset. We systematically evaluated GERBERA on five datasets of eight entity types, collectively consisting of 81,410 instances. Despite using fewer biomedical resources, our models demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models trained with multiple additional BioNER datasets. Specifically, our models consistently outperformed the baselines in six out of eight entity types, achieving an average improvement of 0.9% over the best baseline performance across eight biomedical entity types sourced from five different corpora. Our method was especially effective in amplifying performance on BioNER datasets characterized by limited data, with a 4.7% improvement in F1 scores on the JNLPBA-RNA dataset.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</description>

Abstract: Classical and natural language planning tasks remain a difficult domain for modern large language models (LLMs). In this work, we lay the foundations for improving planning capabilities of LLMs. First, we construct a comprehensive benchmark suite encompassing both classical planning benchmarks and natural language scenarios. This suite includes algorithms to methodically generate instances of tasks with varying levels of difficulty, allowing for rigorous and systematic evaluation of LLM performance. Next, we investigate the use of many-shot in-context learning to enhance LLM planning, exploring the relationship between increased context length and improved planning performance. In addition, we demonstrate the positive impact of fine-tuning LLMs on optimal planning paths. We also probe the efficacy of chain-of-thought reasoning methods to improve LLM planning performance. Moreover, we probe the performance of the proposed methods in out-of-distribution scenarios, assessing the ability to generalize to novel and unseen planning challenges. Finally, we investigate model's failure modes and reveal insights that hold true across different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A LLM-Based Ranking Method for the Evaluation of Automatic Counter-Narrative Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluate Counter Narrative (CN) generation using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an evaluator. We show that traditional automatic metrics correlate poorly with human judgements and fail to capture the nuanced relationship between generated CNs and human perception. To alleviate this, we introduce a model ranking pipeline based on pairwise comparisons of generated CNs from different models, organized in a tournament-style format. The proposed evaluation method achieves a high correlation with human preference, with a $\rho$ score of 0.88. As an additional contribution, we leverage LLMs as zero-shot CN generators and provide a comparative analysis of chat, instruct, and base models, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. Through meticulous evaluation, including fine-tuning experiments, we elucidate the differences in performance and responsiveness to domain-specific data. We conclude that chat-aligned models in zero-shot are the best option for carrying out the task, provided they do not refuse to generate an answer due to security concerns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that pruning large-scale language models for inference is an effective approach to improving model efficiency, significantly reducing model weights with minimal impact on performance. Interestingly, pruning can sometimes even enhance accuracy by removing noise that accumulates during training, particularly through matrix decompositions. However, recent work has primarily focused on single matrix decompositions or lower precision techniques, which may fail to fully capture structural patterns. To address these limitations, we introduce TRAWL (Tensor Reduced and Approximated Weights for Large Language Models), a technique that applies tensor decomposition across multiple weight matrices to effectively denoise LLMs by capturing global structural patterns. Our experiments show that TRAWL improves model performance by up to 16% over baseline models on benchmark datasets, without requiring additional data, training, or fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: One of the most significant problems in cuneiform pedagogy is the process of looking up unknown signs, which often involves a tedious page-by-page search through a sign list. This paper proposes a new "recursive encoding" for signs, which represents the arrangement of strokes in a way a computer can process. A series of new algorithms then offers students a new way to look up signs by any distinctive component, as well as providing new ways to render signs and tablets electronically.</description>

      <title>Implicit Discourse Relation Classification For Nigerian Pidgin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite attempts to make Large Language Models multi-lingual, many of the world's languages are still severely under-resourced. This widens the performance gap between NLP and AI applications aimed at well-financed, and those aimed at less-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Nigerian Pidgin (NP), which is spoken by nearly 100 million people, but has comparatively very few NLP resources and corpora. We address the task of Implicit Discourse Relation Classification (IDRC) and systematically compare an approach translating NP data to English and then using a well-resourced IDRC tool and back-projecting the labels versus creating a synthetic discourse corpus for NP, in which we translate PDTB and project PDTB labels, and then train an NP IDR classifier. The latter approach of learning a "native" NP classifier outperforms our baseline by 13.27\% and 33.98\% in f$_{1}$ score for 4-way and 11-way classification, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segmenting text into fine-grained units of meaning is important to a wide range of NLP applications. The default approach of segmenting text into sentences is often insufficient, especially since sentences are usually complex enough to include multiple units of meaning that merit separate treatment in the downstream task. We focus on the task of abstractive proposition segmentation (APS): transforming text into simple, self-contained, well-formed sentences. Several recent works have demonstrated the utility of proposition segmentation with few-shot prompted LLMs for downstream tasks such as retrieval-augmented grounding and fact verification. However, this approach does not scale to large amounts of text and may not always extract all the facts from the input text. In this paper, we first introduce evaluation metrics for the task to measure several dimensions of quality. We then propose a scalable, yet accurate, proposition segmentation model. We model proposition segmentation as a supervised task by training LLMs on existing annotated datasets and show that training yields significantly improved results. We further show that by using the fine-tuned LLMs (Gemini Pro and Gemini Ultra) as teachers for annotating large amounts of multi-domain synthetic distillation data, we can train smaller student models (Gemma 1 2B and 7B) with results similar to the teacher LLMs. We then demonstrate that our technique leads to effective domain generalization, by annotating data in two domains outside the original training data and evaluating on them. Finally, as a key contribution of the paper, we share an easy-to-use API for NLP practitioners to use.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval-augmented Text-to-SQL with AST-based Ranking and Schema Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on Text-to-SQL semantic parsing from the perspective of retrieval-augmented generation. Motivated by challenges related to the size of commercial database schemata and the deployability of business intelligence solutions, we propose $\text{ASTReS}$ that dynamically retrieves input database information and uses abstract syntax trees to select few-shot examples for in-context learning.
  Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which an in-parallel semantic parser can be leveraged for generating approximated versions of the expected SQL queries, to support our retrieval. We take this approach to the extreme--we adapt a model consisting of less than $500$M parameters, to act as an extremely efficient approximator, enhancing it with the ability to process schemata in a parallelised manner. We apply $\text{ASTReS}$ to monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks for semantic parsing, showing improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments highlight the contribution of modules involved in this retrieval-augmented generation setting, revealing interesting directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Virtual Personas for Language Models via an Anthology of Backstories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained from vast repositories of text authored by millions of distinct authors, reflecting an enormous diversity of human traits. While these models bear the potential to be used as approximations of human subjects in behavioral studies, prior efforts have been limited in steering model responses to match individual human users. In this work, we introduce "Anthology", a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as "backstories." We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics. Our code and generated backstories are available at https://github.com/CannyLab/anthology.</description>

      <title>Nash CoT: Multi-Path Inference with Preference Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) is a reasoning framework that can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex inference tasks. In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a competitive system on each path that balances the generation from role-specific LLMs' and the general LLMs' generation, thereby ensuring both effective role adoption and diversity in LLM generation further maintaining the performance of multi-path inference while reducing the requirement of the number of inference paths. We evaluate Nash CoT across various inference tasks, including Arabic Reasoning, Commonsense Question Answering, and Symbolic Inference, achieving results that are comparable to or better than those of multi-path CoT with the equal number of inference paths.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Formula Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.</description>

      <title>How Personality Traits Influence Negotiation Outcomes? A Simulation based on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Psychological evidence reveals the influence of personality traits on decision-making. For instance, agreeableness is generally associated with positive outcomes in negotiations, whereas neuroticism is often linked to less favorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework centered on Large Language Model (LLM) agents endowed with synthesized personality traits. The agents negotiate within bargaining domains and possess customizable personalities and objectives. The experimental results show that the behavioral tendencies of LLM-based simulations could reproduce behavioral patterns observed in human negotiations. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a simulation methodology that investigates the alignment between the linguistic and economic capabilities of LLM agents. Secondly, we offer empirical insights into the strategic impact of Big-Five personality traits on the outcomes of bilateral negotiations. We also provide a case study based on synthesized bargaining dialogues to reveal intriguing behaviors, including deceitful and compromising behaviors.</description>

      <title>Localizing and Mitigating Errors in Long-form Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) aims to provide thorough and in-depth answers to complex questions, enhancing comprehension. However, such detailed responses are prone to hallucinations and factual inconsistencies, challenging their faithful evaluation. This work introduces HaluQuestQA, the first hallucination dataset with localized error annotations for human-written and model-generated LFQA answers. HaluQuestQA comprises 698 QA pairs with 1.8k span-level error annotations for five different error types by expert annotators, along with preference judgments. Using our collected data, we thoroughly analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers and find that they lack comprehensiveness and provide unhelpful references. We train an automatic feedback model on this dataset that predicts error spans with incomplete information and provides associated explanations. Finally, we propose a prompt-based approach, Error-informed refinement, that uses signals from the learned feedback model to refine generated answers, which we show reduces errors and improves answer quality across multiple models. Furthermore, humans find answers generated by our approach comprehensive and highly prefer them (84%) over the baseline answers.</description>

      <title>Word Embedding Dimension Reduction via Weakly-Supervised Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fundamental task in natural language processing, word embedding converts each word into a representation in a vector space. A challenge with word embedding is that as the vocabulary grows, the vector space's dimension increases, which can lead to a vast model size. Storing and processing word vectors are resource-demanding, especially for mobile edge-devices applications. This paper explores word embedding dimension reduction. To balance computational costs and performance, we propose an efficient and effective weakly-supervised feature selection method named WordFS. It has two variants, each utilizing novel criteria for feature selection. Experiments on various tasks (e.g., word and sentence similarity and binary and multi-class classification) indicate that the proposed WordFS model outperforms other dimension reduction methods at lower computational costs. We have released the code for reproducibility along with the paper.</description>

      <title>CiteME: Can Language Models Accurately Cite Scientific Claims?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thousands of new scientific papers are published each month. Such information overload complicates researcher efforts to stay current with the state-of-the-art as well as to verify and correctly attribute claims. We pose the following research question: Given a text excerpt referencing a paper, could an LM act as a research assistant to correctly identify the referenced paper? We advance efforts to answer this question by building a benchmark that evaluates the abilities of LMs in citation attribution. Our benchmark, CiteME, consists of text excerpts from recent machine learning papers, each referencing a single other paper. CiteME use reveals a large gap between frontier LMs and human performance, with LMs achieving only 4.2-18.5% accuracy and humans 69.7%. We close this gap by introducing CiteAgent, an autonomous system built on the GPT-4o LM that can also search and read papers, which achieves an accuracy of 35.3\% on CiteME. Overall, CiteME serves as a challenging testbed for open-ended claim attribution, driving the research community towards a future where any claim made by an LM can be automatically verified and discarded if found to be incorrect.</description>

      <title>Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) targeting different deployment scales and sizes are currently produced by training each variant from scratch; this is extremely compute-intensive. In this paper, we investigate if pruning an existing LLM and then re-training it with a fraction (&lt;3%) of the original training data can be a suitable alternative to repeated, full retraining. To this end, we develop a set of practical and effective compression best practices for LLMs that combine depth, width, attention and MLP pruning with knowledge distillation-based retraining; we arrive at these best practices through a detailed empirical exploration of pruning strategies for each axis, methods to combine axes, distillation strategies, and search techniques for arriving at optimal compressed architectures. We use this guide to compress the Nemotron-4 family of LLMs by a factor of 2-4x, and compare their performance to similarly-sized models on a variety of language modeling tasks. Deriving 8B and 4B models from an already pretrained 15B model using our approach requires up to 40x fewer training tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in compute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and 4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to training from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. We have open-sourced Minitron model weights on Huggingface, with corresponding supplementary material including example code available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Training Zero-Shot Generalizable End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog System Without Turn-level Dialog Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems enable users to achieve their goals through natural language interactions. Traditionally, these systems have relied on turn-level manually annotated metadata, such as dialogue states and policy annotations, which are expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent or error-prone. This dependence limits the potential to leverage vast amounts of readily available conversational data for training TOD systems. Additionally, a critical challenge in TOD system design is determining when and how to access and integrate information from external sources. Current approaches typically expect this information to be provided alongside the dialogue context, rather than learning to identify and retrieve it autonomously. While pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been used to develop TOD systems, their potential to train such systems without laborious annotations remains largely unexplored. This work employs multi-task instruction fine-tuning to create more efficient and scalable TOD systems that can effectively leverage natural language conversational data without manual annotations, while autonomously managing external information retrieval. Our extensive experimental evaluations, using three diverse TOD datasets and three LLMs of varying sizes, demonstrate that our approach can generalize to new, unseen domains. Notably, our approach outperforms both state-of-the-art models trained on annotated data and billion-scale parameter off-the-shelf ChatGPT models.</description>

      <title>Can GPT-4 learn to analyse moves in research article abstracts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most powerful and enduring ideas in written discourse analysis is that genres can be described in terms of the moves which structure a writer's purpose. Considerable research has sought to identify these distinct communicative acts, but analyses have been beset by problems of subjectivity, reliability and the time-consuming need for multiple coders to confirm analyses. In this paper we employ the affordances of GPT-4 to automate the annotation process by using natural language prompts. Focusing on abstracts from articles in four applied linguistics journals, we devise prompts which enable the model to identify moves effectively. The annotated outputs of these prompts were evaluated by two assessors with a third addressing disagreements. The results show that an 8-shot prompt was more effective than one using two, confirming that the inclusion of examples illustrating areas of variability can enhance GPT-4's ability to recognize multiple moves in a single sentence and reduce bias related to textual position. We suggest that GPT-4 offers considerable potential in automating this annotation process, when human actors with domain specific linguistic expertise inform the prompting process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the robustness of several large language models on multiple datasets. Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.</description>

Abstract: In the era dominated by information overload and its facilitation with Large Language Models (LLMs), the prevalence of misinformation poses a significant threat to public discourse and societal well-being. A critical concern at present involves the identification of machine-generated news. In this work, we take a significant step by introducing a benchmark dataset designed for neural news detection in four languages: English, Turkish, Hungarian, and Persian. The dataset incorporates outputs from multiple multilingual generators (in both, zero-shot and fine-tuned setups) such as BloomZ, LLaMa-2, Mistral, Mixtral, and GPT-4. Next, we experiment with a variety of classifiers, ranging from those based on linguistic features to advanced Transformer-based models and LLMs prompting. We present the detection results aiming to delve into the interpretablity and robustness of machine-generated texts detectors across all target languages.</description>

      <title>Plug, Play, and Fuse: Zero-Shot Joint Decoding via Word-Level Re-ranking Across Diverse Vocabularies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in NLP have resulted in models with specialized strengths, such as processing multimodal inputs or excelling in specific domains. However, real-world tasks, like multimodal translation, often require a combination of these strengths, such as handling both translation and image processing. While individual translation and vision models are powerful, they typically lack the ability to perform both tasks in a single system. Combining these models poses challenges, particularly due to differences in their vocabularies, which limit the effectiveness of traditional ensemble methods to post-generation techniques like N-best list re-ranking. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot ensembling strategy that allows for the integration of different models during the decoding phase without the need for additional training. Our approach re-ranks beams during decoding by combining scores at the word level, using heuristics to predict when a word is completed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in machine translation scenarios, showing that it enables the generation of translations that are both speech- and image-aware while also improving overall translation quality (We will release the code upon paper acceptance.).</description>

CRAG is a question answering dataset contains 3 different subtasks aimed at realistic question and answering RAG related tasks, with a diverse set of question topics, question types, time dynamic answers, and questions featuring entities of varying popularity.
  Our system follows a standard setup for web based RAG, which uses processed web pages to provide context for an LLM to produce generations, while also querying API endpoints for additional information. MARAGS also utilizes multiple different adapters to solve the various requirements for these tasks with a standard cross-encoder model for ranking candidate passages relevant for answering the question. Our system achieved 2nd place for Task 1 as well as 3rd place on Task 2.</description>

      <title>READoc: A Unified Benchmark for Realistic Document Structured Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 2,233 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv and GitHub. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.</description>

      <title>WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.</description>

      <title>ToolPlanner: A Tool Augmented LLM for Multi Granularity Instructions with Path Planning and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, tool-augmented LLMs have gained increasing attention. Given an instruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in multiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained on overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while real users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap between trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore whether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these issues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains statement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world scenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLM's task completion and instruction-following capabilities. Experimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match Rate, Pass Rate and Win Rate by 26.8%, 20.2%, and 5.6% compared to the SOTA model. Human evaluation verifies that the multi-granularity instructions can better align with users' usage habits. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Internalizing ASR with Implicit Chain of Thought for Efficient Speech-to-Speech Conversational LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current speech-based LLMs are predominantly trained on extensive ASR and TTS datasets, excelling in tasks related to these domains. However, their ability to handle direct speech-to-speech conversations remains notably constrained. These models often rely on an ASR-to-TTS chain-of-thought pipeline, converting speech into text for processing before generating audio responses, which introduces latency and loses audio features. We propose a method that implicitly internalizes ASR chain of thought into a speech LLM, enhancing its native speech understanding capabilities. Our approach reduces latency and improves the model's native understanding of speech, paving the way for more efficient and natural real-time audio interactions. We also release a large-scale synthetic conversational dataset to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Compression with Neural Architecture Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, allowing them to generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning or instruction following. However, as LLMs scale, inference costs become increasingly prohibitive, accumulating significantly over their life cycle. This poses the question: Can we compress pre-trained LLMs to meet diverse size and latency requirements? We leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to compress LLMs by pruning structural components, such as attention heads, neurons, and layers, aiming to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. While NAS already achieved promising results on small language models in previous work, in this paper we propose various extensions that allow us to scale to LLMs. Compared to structural pruning baselines, we show that NAS improves performance up to 3.4% on MMLU with an on-device latency speedup.</description>

      <title>TorchTitan: One-stop PyTorch native solution for production ready LLM pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort.
  This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences.
  We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.</description>

      <title>Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Textual Graph Generation Via Large-Scale LLM-based Agent Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task that has been extensively studied in social, technological, and scientific analysis. For modeling the dynamic graph evolution process, traditional rule-based methods struggle to capture community structures within graphs, while deep learning methods only focus on fitting training graphs. This limits existing graph generators to producing graphs that adhere to predefined rules or closely resemble training datasets, achieving poor performance in dynamic graph generation. Given that graphs are abstract representations arising from pairwise interactions in human activities, a realistic simulation of human-wise interaction could provide deeper insights into the graph evolution mechanism. With the increasing recognition of large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior, we introduce GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic graph generation. Without training or fine-tuning process of LLM, our framework effectively replicates seven macro-level structural characteristics in established network science theories while surpassing existing baselines in graph expansion tasks by 31\% on specific evaluation metrics. Through node classification task, we validate GAG effectively preserves characteristics of real-world network for node-wise textual features in generated text-rich graph. Furthermore, by incorporating parallel acceleration, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation, with a minimum speed-up of 90.4\%.

Abstract: Are Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stochastic parrots? Do they genuinely understand? This paper aims to explore the core cognitive abilities that human intelligence builds upon to perceive, comprehend, and reason in MLLMs. To this end, we propose CogDevelop2K, a comprehensive benchmark that spans 12 sub-concepts from primitive knowledge like object permanence and boundary to more complex abilities like intentionality understanding, structured via the developmental trajectory of a human mind. We evaluate 46 MLLMs on our benchmarks. Surprisingly, we observe a reversed cognitive developmental trajectory compared to humans. Comprehensively, we further evaluate the influence of evaluation strategies and prompting techniques. Website with this $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/}{link}$.</description>

      <title>DISP-LLM: Dimension-Independent Structural Pruning for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, understanding, and generation. However, the increased memory and computational costs associated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing for the first time that structural pruning can achieve an accuracy similar to semi-structural pruning.</description>

      <title>Attr-Int: A Simple and Effective Entity Alignment Framework for Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) refers to the task of linking entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing EA methods rely heavily on structural isomorphism. However, in real-world KGs, aligned entities usually have non-isomorphic neighborhood structures, which paralyses the application of these structure-dependent methods. In this paper, we investigate and tackle the problem of entity alignment between heterogeneous KGs. First, we propose two new benchmarks to closely simulate real-world EA scenarios of heterogeneity. Then we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of representative EA methods on the new benchmarks. Finally, we propose a simple and effective entity alignment framework called Attr-Int, in which innovative attribute information interaction methods can be seamlessly integrated with any embedding encoder for entity alignment, improving the performance of existing entity alignment techniques. Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on two new benchmarks.</description>

      <title>BERTtime Stories: Investigating the Role of Synthetic Story Data in Language pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe our contribution to the Strict and Strict-Small tracks of the 2nd iteration of the BabyLM Challenge. The shared task is centered around efficient pre-training given data constraints motivated by human development. In response, we study the effect of synthetic story data in language pre-training using TinyStories: a recently introduced dataset of short stories. Initially, we train GPT-Neo models on subsets of TinyStories, while varying the amount of available data. We find that, even with access to less than 100M words, the models are able to generate high-quality, original completions to a given story, and acquire substantial linguistic knowledge. To measure the effect of synthetic story data, we train LTG-BERT encoder models on a combined dataset of: a subset of TinyStories, story completions generated by GPT-Neo, and a subset of the BabyLM dataset. Our experimentation reveals that synthetic data can occasionally offer modest gains, but overall have a negative influence on linguistic understanding. Our work offers an initial study on synthesizing story data in low resource settings and underscores their potential for augmentation in data-constrained language modeling. We publicly release our models and implementation on our GitHub.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Materials: Leveraging Language Models for Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the predictive capabilities of language models in material science is an ongoing interest. This study investigates the application of language model embeddings to enhance material property prediction in materials science. By evaluating various contextual embedding methods and pre-trained models, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), we demonstrate that domain-specific models, particularly MatBERT significantly outperform general-purpose models in extracting implicit knowledge from compound names and material properties. Our findings reveal that information-dense embeddings from the third layer of MatBERT, combined with a context-averaging approach, offer the most effective method for capturing material-property relationships from the scientific literature. We also identify a crucial "tokenizer effect," highlighting the importance of specialized text processing techniques that preserve complete compound names while maintaining consistent token counts. These insights underscore the value of domain-specific training and tokenization in materials science applications and offer a promising pathway for accelerating the discovery and development of new materials through AI-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Building A Coding Assistant via the Retrieval-Augmented Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained language models have shown strong effectiveness in code-related tasks, such as code retrieval, code generation, code summarization, and code completion tasks. In this paper, we propose COde assistaNt viA retrieval-augmeNted language model (CONAN), which aims to build a code assistant by mimicking the knowledge-seeking behaviors of humans during coding. Specifically, it consists of a code structure aware retriever (CONAN-R) and a dual-view code representation-based retrieval-augmented generation model (CONAN-G). CONAN-R pretrains CodeT5 using Code-Documentation Alignment and Masked Entity Prediction tasks to make language models code structure-aware and learn effective representations for code snippets and documentation. Then CONAN-G designs a dual-view code representation mechanism for implementing a retrieval-augmented code generation model. CONAN-G regards the code documentation descriptions as prompts, which help language models better understand the code semantics. Our experiments show that CONAN achieves convincing performance on different code generation tasks and significantly outperforms previous retrieval augmented code generation models. Our further analyses show that CONAN learns tailored representations for both code snippets and documentation by aligning code-documentation data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the code data. Additionally, the retrieved code snippets and documentation provide necessary information from both program language and natural language to assist the code generation process. CONAN can also be used as an assistant for Large Language Models (LLMs), providing LLMs with external knowledge in shorter code document lengths to improve their effectiveness on various code tasks. It shows the ability of CONAN to extract necessary information and help filter out the noise from retrieved code documents.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>

Abstract: Climate change poses critical challenges globally, disproportionately affecting low-income countries that often lack resources and linguistic representation on the international stage. Despite Bangladesh's status as one of the most vulnerable nations to climate impacts, research gaps persist in Bengali-language studies related to climate change and NLP. To address this disparity, we introduce Dhoroni, a novel Bengali (Bangla) climate change and environmental news dataset, comprising a 2300 annotated Bangla news articles, offering multiple perspectives such as political influence, scientific/statistical data, authenticity, stance detection, and stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we present an in-depth exploratory analysis of Dhoroni and introduce BanglaBERT-Dhoroni family, a novel baseline model family for climate and environmental opinion detection in Bangla, fine-tuned on our dataset. This research contributes significantly to enhancing accessibility and analysis of climate discourse in Bengali (Bangla), addressing crucial communication and research gaps in climate-impacted regions like Bangladesh with 180 million people.</description>

      <title>Little Giants: Synthesizing High-Quality Embedding Data at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation has become an increasingly popular way of training models without the need for large, manually labeled datasets. For tasks like text embedding, synthetic data offers diverse and scalable training examples, significantly reducing the cost of human annotation. However, most current approaches rely heavily on proprietary models like GPT-4, which are expensive and inefficient for generating large-scale embedding data. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a framework that aligns open-source small models (8B) to efficiently generate large-scale synthetic embedding data. Through supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small open-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only less than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art embedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic data. Using this efficient generator, we conduct a comprehensive study on how various factors within the alignment pipeline impact data quality and reveal the scaling law for synthetic embedding data.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Implicit and Explicit Emotional Events Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their impressive performance. While considerable research has evaluated these models from various perspectives, the extent to which LLMs can perform implicit and explicit emotion retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study investigates LLMs' emotion retrieval capabilities in commonsense. Through extensive experiments involving multiple models, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs on emotion retrieval. Specifically, we propose a supervised contrastive probing method to verify LLMs' performance for implicit and explicit emotion retrieval, as well as the diversity of the emotional events they retrieve. The results offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in handling emotion retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to characterize Generative linguistics (GL) contribution to artificial intelligence (AI), alluding to the debate among linguists and AI scientists on whether linguistics belongs to humanities or science. In this article, I will try not to be biased as a linguist, studying the phenomenon from an independent scientific perspective. The article walks the researcher/reader through the scientific theorems and rationales involved in AI which belong from GL, specifically the Chomsky School. It, thus, provides good evidence from syntax, semantics, language faculty, Universal Grammar, computational system of human language, language acquisition, human brain, programming languages (e.g. Python), Large Language Models, and unbiased AI scientists that this contribution is huge, and that this contribution cannot be denied. It concludes that however the huge GL contribution to AI, there are still points of divergence including the nature and type of language input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive population election simulation aims to model the preferences of specific groups in particular election scenarios. It has garnered significant attention for its potential to forecast real-world social trends. Traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) methods are constrained by their ability to incorporate complex individual background information and provide interactive prediction results. In this paper, we introduce ElectionSim, an innovative election simulation framework based on large language models, designed to support accurate voter simulations and customized distributions, together with an interactive platform to dialogue with simulated voters. We present a million-level voter pool sampled from social media platforms to support accurate individual simulation. We also introduce PPE, a poll-based presidential election benchmark to assess the performance of our framework under the U.S. presidential election scenario. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in U.S. presidential election simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used but raise ethical concerns due to embedded social biases. This study examines LLM biases against Arabs versus Westerners across eight domains, including women's rights, terrorism, and anti-Semitism and assesses model resistance to perpetuating these biases. To this end, we create two datasets: one to evaluate LLM bias toward Arabs versus Westerners and another to test model safety against prompts that exaggerate negative traits ("jailbreaks"). We evaluate six LLMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, LlaMA 3.1 (8B &amp; 405B), Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find 79% of cases displaying negative biases toward Arabs, with LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Our jailbreak tests reveal GPT-4o as the most vulnerable, despite being an optimized version, followed by LlaMA 3.1-8B and Mistral 7B. All LLMs except Claude exhibit attack success rates above 87% in three categories. We also find Claude 3.5 Sonnet the safest, but it still displays biases in seven of eight categories. Despite being an optimized version of GPT4, We find GPT-4o to be more prone to biases and jailbreaks, suggesting optimization flaws. Our findings underscore the pressing need for more robust bias mitigation strategies and strengthened security measures in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Workplace meetings are vital to organizational collaboration, yet a large percentage of meetings are rated as ineffective. To help improve meeting effectiveness by understanding if the conversation is on topic, we create a comprehensive Topic-Conversation Relevance (TCR) dataset that covers a variety of domains and meeting styles. The TCR dataset includes 1,500 unique meetings, 22 million words in transcripts, and over 15,000 meeting topics, sourced from both newly collected Speech Interruption Meeting (SIM) data and existing public datasets. Along with the text data, we also open source scripts to generate synthetic meetings or create augmented meetings from the TCR dataset to enhance data diversity. For each data source, benchmarks are created using GPT-4 to evaluate the model accuracy in understanding transcription-topic relevance.</description>

      <title>ACC-Debate: An Actor-Critic Approach to Multi-Agent Debate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to serve as general-purpose tools for various language-based tasks. Recent works have demonstrated that the efficacy of such models can be improved through iterative dialog between multiple models, frequently referred to as multi-agent debate (MAD). While debate shows promise as a means of improving model efficacy, most works in this area treat debate as an emergent behavior, rather than a learned behavior. In doing so, current debate frameworks rely on collaborative behaviors to have been sufficiently trained into off-the-shelf models. To address this limitation, we propose ACC-Debate, an Actor-Critic based learning framework to produce a two-agent team specialized in debate. We demonstrate that ACC-Debate outperforms SotA debate techniques on a wide array of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LLM-Ref: Enhancing Reference Handling in Technical Writing with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in data synthesis but can be inaccurate in domain-specific tasks, which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address by leveraging user-provided data. However, RAGs require optimization in both retrieval and generation stages, which can affect output quality. In this paper, we present LLM-Ref, a writing assistant tool that aids researchers in writing articles from multiple source documents with enhanced reference synthesis and handling capabilities. Unlike traditional RAG systems that use chunking and indexing, our tool retrieves and generates content directly from text paragraphs. This method facilitates direct reference extraction from the generated outputs, a feature unique to our tool. Additionally, our tool employs iterative response generation, effectively managing lengthy contexts within the language model's constraints. Compared to baseline RAG-based systems, our approach achieves a $3.25\times$ to $6.26\times$ increase in Ragas score, a comprehensive metric that provides a holistic view of a RAG system's ability to produce accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. This improvement shows our method enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of writing assistance tools.</description>

      <title>ReverseNER: A Self-Generated Example-Driven Framework for Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents ReverseNER, a framework aimed at overcoming the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, particularly in cases where certain entity types have ambiguous boundaries. ReverseNER tackles this challenge by constructing a reliable example library with the reversed process of NER. Rather than beginning with sentences, this method uses an LLM to generate entities based on their definitions and then expands them into full sentences. During sentence generation, the LLM is guided to replicate the structure of a specific 'feature sentence', extracted from the task sentences by clustering. This results in well-annotated sentences with clearly labeled entities, while preserving semantic and structural similarity to the task sentences. Once the example library is constructed, the method selects the most semantically similar example labels for each task sentence to support the LLM's inference. We also propose an entity-level self-consistency scoring mechanism to improve NER performance with LLMs. Experiments show that ReverseNER significantly outperforms traditional zero-shot NER with LLMs and surpasses several few-shot methods, marking a notable improvement in NER for domains with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>AV2Wav: Diffusion-Based Re-synthesis from Continuous Self-supervised Features for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08030v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement systems are typically trained using pairs of clean and noisy speech. In audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE), there is not as much ground-truth clean data available; most audio-visual datasets are collected in real-world environments with background noise and reverberation, hampering the development of AVSE. In this work, we introduce AV2Wav, a resynthesis-based audio-visual speech enhancement approach that can generate clean speech despite the challenges of real-world training data. We obtain a subset of nearly clean speech from an audio-visual corpus using a neural quality estimator, and then train a diffusion model on this subset to generate waveforms conditioned on continuous speech representations from AV-HuBERT with noise-robust training. We use continuous rather than discrete representations to retain prosody and speaker information. With this vocoding task alone, the model can perform speech enhancement better than a masking-based baseline. We further fine-tune the diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs to improve the performance. Our approach outperforms a masking-based baseline in terms of both automatic metrics and a human listening test and is close in quality to the target speech in the listening test. Audio samples can be found at https://home.ttic.edu/~jcchou/demo/avse/avse_demo.html.</description>

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces is an important and hot research topic that revolutionize how people interact with the world, especially for individuals with neurological disorders. While extensive research has been done in EEG signals of English letters and words, a major limitation remains: the lack of publicly available EEG datasets for many non-English languages, such as Arabic. Although Arabic is one of the most spoken languages worldwide, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for EEG signals of Arabic characters until now. To address this gap, we introduce ArEEG_Chars, a novel EEG dataset for Arabic 31 characters collected from 30 participants (21 males and 9 females), these records were collected using Epoc X 14 channels device for 10 seconds long for each char record. The number of recorded signals were 930 EEG recordings. To make the EEG signals suitable for analyzing, each recording has been split into multiple signals with a time duration of 250ms, respectively. Therefore, a total of 39857 recordings of EEG signals have been collected in this study. Moreover, ArEEG_Chars will be publicly available for researchers. We do hope that this dataset will fill an important gap in the research of Arabic EEG benefiting Arabic-speaking individuals with disabilities.</description>

However, current interactions between IR systems and LLMs remain limited, with LLMs merely serving as part of components within IR systems, and IR systems being constructed independently of LLMs. This separated architecture restricts knowledge sharing and deep collaboration between them. In this paper, we introduce Self-Retrieval, a novel end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture. Self-Retrieval unifies all essential IR functions within a single LLM, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs throughout the IR process. Specifically, Self-Retrieval internalizes the retrieval corpus through self-supervised learning, transforms the retrieval process into sequential passage generation, and performs relevance assessment for reranking. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only outperforms existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin, but also substantially enhances the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval-augmented generation.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation of Language Models with a Memory of Amortized Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the rapid generation and dissemination of information, large language models (LLMs) quickly run out of date despite enormous development costs. To address the crucial need to keep models updated, online learning has emerged as a critical tool when utilizing LLMs for real-world applications. However, given the ever-expanding corpus of unseen documents and the large parameter space of modern LLMs, efficient adaptation is essential. To address these challenges, we propose Memory of Amortized Contexts (MAC), an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for LLMs with strong knowledge retention. We propose a feature extraction and memory-augmentation approach to compress and extract information from new documents into compact modulations stored in a memory bank. When answering questions, our model attends to and extracts relevant knowledge from this memory bank. To learn informative modulations in an efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based meta-learning, which substitutes an otherwise required optimization process with a single forward pass of the encoder. Subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate selected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question, allowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring further gradient updates. Our experiment demonstrates the superiority of MAC in multiple aspects, including online adaptation performance, time, and memory efficiency. In addition, we show how MAC can be combined with and improve the performance of popular alternatives such as retrieval augmented generations (RAGs).

      <description>arXiv:2403.11425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer treatments are known to introduce cardiotoxicity, negatively impacting outcomes and survivorship. Identifying cancer patients at risk of heart failure (HF) is critical to improving cancer treatment outcomes and safety. This study examined machine learning (ML) models to identify cancer patients at risk of HF using electronic health records (EHRs), including traditional ML, Time-Aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM), and large language models (LLMs) using novel narrative features derived from the structured medical codes. We identified a cancer cohort of 12,806 patients from the University of Florida Health, diagnosed with lung, breast, and colorectal cancers, among which 1,602 individuals developed HF after cancer. The LLM, GatorTron-3.9B, achieved the best F1 scores, outperforming the traditional support vector machines by 39%, the T-LSTM deep learning model by 7%, and a widely used transformer model, BERT, by 5.6%. The analysis shows that the proposed narrative features remarkably increased feature density and improved performance.</description>

Abstract: Neural Code Intelligence -- leveraging deep learning to understand, generate, and optimize code -- holds immense potential for transformative impacts on the whole society. Bridging the gap between Natural Language and Programming Language, this domain has drawn significant attention from researchers in both research communities over the past few years. This survey presents a systematic and chronological review of the advancements in code intelligence, encompassing over 50 representative models and their variants, more than 20 categories of tasks, and an extensive coverage of over 680 related works. We follow the historical progression to trace the paradigm shifts across different research phases (e.g., from modeling code with recurrent neural networks to the era of Large Language Models). Concurrently, we highlight the major technical transitions in models, tasks, and evaluations spanning through different stages. For applications, we also observe a co-evolving shift. It spans from initial endeavors to tackling specific scenarios, through exploring a diverse array of tasks during its rapid expansion, to currently focusing on tackling increasingly complex and varied real-world challenges. Building on our examination of the developmental trajectories, we further investigate the emerging synergies between code intelligence and broader machine intelligence, uncovering new cross-domain opportunities and illustrating the substantial influence of code intelligence across various domains. Finally, we delve into both the opportunities and challenges associated with this field, alongside elucidating our insights on the most promising research directions. An ongoing, dynamically updated project and resources associated with this survey have been released at https://github.com/QiushiSun/Awesome-Code-Intelligence.</description>

      <title>Have You Merged My Model? On The Robustness of Large Language Model IP Protection Methods Against Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging is a promising lightweight model empowerment technique that does not rely on expensive computing devices (e.g., GPUs) or require the collection of specific training data. Instead, it involves editing different upstream model parameters to absorb their downstream task capabilities. However, uncertified model merging can infringe upon the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the original upstream models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the robustness of IP protection methods under model merging scenarios. Specifically, we investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.

      <title>CATS: Contextually-Aware Thresholding for Sparsity in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced AI applications, yet their deployment remains challenging due to their immense inference costs. Recent studies ameliorate the computational costs of LLMs by increasing their activation sparsity but suffer from significant performance degradation on downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a new framework for sparsifying the activations of base LLMs and reducing inference costs, dubbed Contextually Aware Thresholding for Sparsity (CATS). CATS is relatively simple, easy to implement, and highly effective. At the heart of our framework is a new non-linear activation function. We demonstrate that CATS can be applied to various base models, including Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B, and outperforms existing sparsification techniques in downstream task performance. More precisely, CATS-based models often achieve downstream task performance within 1-2% of their base models without any fine-tuning and even at activation sparsity levels of 50%. Furthermore, CATS-based models converge faster and display better task performance than competing techniques when fine-tuning is applied. Finally, we develop a custom GPU kernel for efficient implementation of CATS that translates the activation of sparsity of CATS to real wall-clock time speedups. Our custom kernel implementation of CATS results in a ~15% improvement in wall-clock inference latency of token generation on both Llama-7B and Mistral-7B.</description>

      <title>Real-world Instance-specific Image Goal Navigation: Bridging Domain Gaps via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving instance-specific image goal navigation (InstanceImageNav), which locates the identical object in a real-world environment from a query image, is essential for robotic systems to assist users in finding desired objects. The challenge lies in the domain gap between low-quality images observed by the moving robot, characterized by motion blur and low-resolution, and high-quality query images provided by the user. Such domain gaps could significantly reduce the task success rate but have not been the focus of previous work. To address this, we propose a novel method called Few-shot Cross-quality Instance-aware Adaptation (CrossIA), which employs contrastive learning with an instance classifier to align features between massive low- and few high-quality images. This approach effectively reduces the domain gap by bringing the latent representations of cross-quality images closer on an instance basis. Additionally, the system integrates an object image collection with a pre-trained deblurring model to enhance the observed image quality. Our method fine-tunes the SimSiam model, pre-trained on ImageNet, using CrossIA. We evaluated our method's effectiveness through an InstanceImageNav task with 20 different types of instances, where the robot identifies the same instance in a real-world environment as a high-quality query image. Our experiments showed that our method improves the task success rate by up to three times compared to the baseline, a conventional approach based on SuperGlue. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging contrastive learning and image enhancement techniques to bridge the domain gap and improve object localization in robotic applications.

      <title>GSCo: Towards Generalizable AI in Medicine via Generalist-Specialist Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalist foundation models (GFMs) are renowned for their exceptional capability and flexibility in effectively generalizing across diverse tasks and modalities. In the field of medicine, while GFMs exhibit superior generalizability based on their extensive intrinsic knowledge as well as proficiency in instruction following and in-context learning, specialist models excel in precision due to their domain knowledge. In this work, for the first time, we explore the synergy between the GFM and specialist models, to enable precise medical image analysis on a broader scope. Specifically, we propose a cooperative framework, Generalist-Specialist Collaboration (GSCo), which consists of two stages, namely the construction of GFM and specialists, and collaborative inference on downstream tasks. In the construction stage, we develop MedDr, the largest open-source GFM tailored for medicine, showcasing exceptional instruction-following and in-context learning capabilities. Meanwhile, a series of lightweight specialists are crafted for downstream tasks with low computational cost. In the collaborative inference stage, we introduce two cooperative mechanisms, Mixture-of-Expert Diagnosis and Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis, to harvest the generalist's in-context learning abilities alongside the specialists' domain expertise. For a comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale benchmark featuring 28 datasets and about 250,000 images. Extensive results demonstrate that MedDr consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs on downstream datasets. Furthermore, GSCo exceeds both GFMs and specialists across all out-of-domain disease diagnosis datasets. These findings indicate a significant paradigm shift in the application of GFMs, transitioning from separate models for specific tasks to a collaborative approach between GFMs and specialists, thereby advancing the frontiers of generalizable AI in medicine.</description>

      <title>TOPA: Extending Large Language Models for Video Understanding via Text-Only Pre-Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema. This performance surpasses previous video-text pre-training approaches and proves competitive with recent GPT-3.5-based video agents.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Self-Rewarding Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</description>

      <title>A Textbook Remedy for Domain Shifts: Knowledge Priors for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations. We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Parallelism with Controllable Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pipeline parallelism has been widely explored, but most existing schedules lack a systematic methodology. In this paper, we propose a framework to decompose pipeline schedules as repeating a building block, and show that the lifespan of the building block decides the peak activation memory of the pipeline schedule. Guided by the observations, we find that almost all existing pipeline schedules, to the best of our knowledge, are memory inefficient. To address this, we introduce a family of memory efficient building blocks with controllable activation memory, which can reduce the peak activation memory to 1/2 of 1F1B without sacrificing efficiency, and even to 1/3 with comparable throughput. We can also achieve almost zero pipeline bubbles while maintaining the same activation memory as 1F1B. Our evaluations demonstrate that in pure pipeline parallelism settings, our methods outperform 1F1B by from 7% to 55% in terms of throughput. When employing a grid search over hybrid parallelism hyperparameters in practical scenarios, our methods demonstrate a 16% throughput improvement over the 1F1B baseline for large language models. The implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism.</description>

      <title>LoQT: Low-Rank Adapters for Quantized Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16528v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances using low-rank adapters and quantization, pretraining of large models on consumer hardware has not been possible without model sharding, offloading during training, or per-layer gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose Low-Rank Adapters for Quantized Training (LoQT), a method for efficiently training quantized models. LoQT uses gradient-based tensor factorization to initialize low-rank trainable weight matrices that are periodically merged into quantized full-rank weight matrices. Our approach is suitable for both pretraining and fine-tuning models. We demonstrate this for language modeling and downstream task adaptation, finding that LoQT enables efficient training of models up to 7B parameters on a 24GB GPU. We also demonstrate the feasibility of training a 13B model using per-layer gradient updates on the same hardware.</description>

      <title>InversionView: A General-Purpose Method for Reading Information from Neural Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inner workings of neural networks can be better understood if we can fully decipher the information encoded in neural activations. In this paper, we argue that this information is embodied by the subset of inputs that give rise to similar activations. We propose InversionView, which allows us to practically inspect this subset by sampling from a trained decoder model conditioned on activations. This helps uncover the information content of activation vectors, and facilitates understanding of the algorithms implemented by transformer models. We present four case studies where we investigate models ranging from small transformers to GPT-2. In these studies, we show that InversionView can reveal clear information contained in activations, including basic information about tokens appearing in the context, as well as more complex information, such as the count of certain tokens, their relative positions, and abstract knowledge about the subject. We also provide causally verified circuits to confirm the decoded information.</description>

      <title>Why are Visually-Grounded Language Models Bad at Image Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the VLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.</description>

      <title>Are you still on track!? Catching LLM Task Drift with Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00799v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user instructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search engines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email plugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However, the potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language instructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the user's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task drift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or influence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a solution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference in activations before and after processing external data - are strongly correlated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal assumptions about how user's tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased. We observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that this solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting solutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy. To encourage further research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, featuring a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from six SoTA language models, and inspection tools.</description>

      <title>CVQA: Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, and it is often used to test the ability of vision-language models to understand and reason on knowledge present in both visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 30 countries on four continents, covering 31 languages with 13 scripts, providing a total of 10k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</description>

      <title>CARES: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Trustworthiness in Medical Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has significantly impacted medical applications, particularly with the advent of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), sparking optimism for the future of automated and personalized healthcare. However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://cares-ai.github.io/.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Dataset for Personal Attribute Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) have become easily accessible to hundreds of millions of users world-wide. However, their strong capabilities and vast world knowledge do not come without associated privacy risks. In this work, we focus on the emerging privacy threat LLMs pose -- the ability to accurately infer personal information from online texts. Despite the growing importance of LLM-based author profiling, research in this area has been hampered by a lack of suitable public datasets, largely due to ethical and privacy concerns associated with real personal data. We take two steps to address this problem: (i) we construct a simulation framework for the popular social media platform Reddit using LLM agents seeded with synthetic personal profiles; (ii) using this framework, we generate SynthPAI, a diverse synthetic dataset of over 7800 comments manually labeled for personal attributes. We validate our dataset with a human study showing that humans barely outperform random guessing on the task of distinguishing our synthetic comments from real ones. Further, we verify that our dataset enables meaningful personal attribute inference research by showing across 18 state-of-the-art LLMs that our synthetic comments allow us to draw the same conclusions as real-world data. Combined, our experimental results, dataset and pipeline form a strong basis for future privacy-preserving research geared towards understanding and mitigating inference-based privacy threats that LLMs pose.</description>

      <title>BiVLC: Extending Vision-Language Compositionality Evaluation with Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Compositionality (VLC) benchmarks like SugarCrepe are formulated as image-to-text retrieval problems, where, given an image, the models need to select between the correct textual description and a synthetic hard negative text. In this work, we present the Bidirectional Vision-Language Compositionality (BiVLC) dataset. The novelty of BiVLC is to add a synthetic hard negative image generated from the synthetic text, resulting in two image-to-text retrieval examples (one for each image) and, more importantly, two text-to-image retrieval examples (one for each text). Human annotators filter out ill-formed examples ensuring the validity of the benchmark. The experiments on BiVLC uncover a weakness of current multimodal models, as they perform poorly in the text-to-image direction. In fact, when considering both retrieval directions, the conclusions obtained in previous works change significantly. In addition to the benchmark, we show that a contrastive model trained using synthetic images and texts significantly improves over the base model in SugarCrepe and in BiVLC for both retrieval directions. The gap to human performance in BiVLC confirms that Vision-Language Compositionality is still a challenging problem. BiVLC and code are available at https://imirandam.github.io/BiVLC_project_page.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Bench: Evaluating and Improving Compositional Text-to-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While text-to-visual models now produce photo-realistic images and videos, they struggle with compositional text prompts involving attributes, relationships, and higher-order reasoning such as logic and comparison. In this work, we conduct an extensive human study on GenAI-Bench to evaluate the performance of leading image and video generation models in various aspects of compositional text-to-visual generation. We also compare automated evaluation metrics against our collected human ratings and find that VQAScore -- a metric measuring the likelihood that a VQA model views an image as accurately depicting the prompt -- significantly outperforms previous metrics such as CLIPScore. In addition, VQAScore can improve generation in a black-box manner (without finetuning) via simply ranking a few (3 to 9) candidate images. Ranking by VQAScore is 2x to 3x more effective than other scoring methods like PickScore, HPSv2, and ImageReward at improving human alignment ratings for DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion, especially on compositional prompts that require advanced visio-linguistic reasoning. We release a new GenAI-Rank benchmark with over 40,000 human ratings to evaluate scoring metrics on ranking images generated from the same prompt. Lastly, we discuss promising areas for improvement in VQAScore, such as addressing fine-grained visual details. We will release all human ratings (over 80,000) to facilitate scientific benchmarking of both generative models and automated metrics.</description>

      <title>Code-Switching Red-Teaming: LLM Evaluation for Safety and Multilingual Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, concerns regarding their safety have become prominent. In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize code-switching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand code-switching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating code-switching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.</description>

      <title>ChartGemma: Visual Instruction-tuning for Chart Reasoning in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the ubiquity of charts as a data analysis, visualization, and decision-making tool across industries and sciences, there has been a growing interest in developing pre-trained foundation models as well as general purpose instruction-tuned models for chart understanding and reasoning. However, existing methods suffer crucial drawbacks across two critical axes affecting the performance of chart representation models: they are trained on data generated from underlying data tables of the charts, ignoring the visual trends and patterns in chart images, and use weakly aligned vision-language backbone models for domain-specific training, limiting their generalizability when encountering charts in the wild. We address these important drawbacks and introduce ChartGemma, a novel chart understanding and reasoning model developed over PaliGemma. Rather than relying on underlying data tables, ChartGemma is trained on instruction-tuning data generated directly from chart images, thus capturing both high-level trends and low-level visual information from a diverse set of charts. Our simple approach achieves state-of-the-art results across $5$ benchmarks spanning chart summarization, question answering, and fact-checking, and our elaborate qualitative studies on real-world charts show that ChartGemma generates more realistic and factually correct summaries compared to its contemporaries. We release the code, model checkpoints, dataset, and demos at https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartGemma.</description>

      <title>PutnamBench: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PutnamBench, a new multi-language benchmark for evaluating the ability of neural theorem-provers to solve competition mathematics problems. PutnamBench consists of 1692 hand-constructed formalizations of 640 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the premier undergraduate-level mathematics competition in North America. All the problems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq formalizations. PutnamBench requires significant problem-solving ability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate mathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural and symbolic theorem-provers. These approaches can only solve a handful of the PutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge for research on neural theorem-proving. PutnamBench is available at https://github.com/trishullab/PutnamBench.</description>

      <title>3-in-1: 2D Rotary Adaptation for Efficient Finetuning, Efficient Batching and Composability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods effectively adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks, reducing storage and GPU memory demands. Despite these advantages, several applications pose new challenges to PEFT beyond mere parameter efficiency. One notable challenge involves the efficient deployment of LLMs equipped with multiple task- or user-specific adapters, particularly when different adapters are needed for distinct requests within the same batch. Another challenge is the interpretability of LLMs, which is crucial for understanding how LLMs function. Previous studies introduced various approaches to address different challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, RoAd, which employs a straightforward 2D rotation to adapt LLMs and addresses all the above challenges: (1) RoAd is remarkably parameter-efficient, delivering optimal performance on GLUE, eight commonsense reasoning tasks and four arithmetic reasoning tasks with $&lt;0.1\%$ trainable parameters; (2) RoAd facilitates the efficient serving of requests requiring different adapters within a batch, with an overhead comparable to element-wise multiplication instead of batch matrix multiplication; (3) RoAd enhances LLM's interpretability through integration within a framework of distributed interchange intervention, demonstrated via composition experiments.</description>

      <title>TROPE: TRaining-Free Object-Part Enhancement for Seamlessly Improving Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot inference, where pre-trained models perform tasks without specific training data, is an exciting emergent ability of large models like CLIP. Although there has been considerable exploration into enhancing zero-shot abilities in image captioning (IC) for popular datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr8k, these approaches fall short with fine-grained datasets like CUB, FLO, UCM-Captions, and Sydney-Captions. These datasets require captions to discern between visually and semantically similar classes, focusing on detailed object parts and their attributes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRaining-Free Object-Part Enhancement (TROPE). TROPE enriches a base caption with additional object-part details using object detector proposals and Natural Language Processing techniques. It complements rather than alters the base caption, allowing seamless integration with other captioning methods and offering users enhanced flexibility. Our evaluations show that TROPE consistently boosts performance across all tested zero-shot IC approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained IC datasets.</description>

      <title>Ocean-omni: To Understand the World with Omni-modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Ocean-omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</description>

      <title>LLM Confidence Evaluation Measures in Zero-Shot CSS Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing classification confidence is critical for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in automated labeling tasks, especially in the sensitive domains presented by Computational Social Science (CSS) tasks. In this paper, we make three key contributions: (1) we propose an uncertainty quantification (UQ) performance measure tailored for data annotation tasks, (2) we compare, for the first time, five different UQ strategies across three distinct LLMs and CSS data annotation tasks, (3) we introduce a novel UQ aggregation strategy that effectively identifies low-confidence LLM annotations and disproportionately uncovers data incorrectly labeled by the LLMs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed UQ aggregation strategy improves upon existing methods andcan be used to significantly improve human-in-the-loop data annotation processes.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Replace Programmers? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy, i.e., more than 90% pass@1, in solving Python coding problems in HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, whether LLMs achieve comparable code completion performance compared to human developers? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question using existing manual crafted or simple (e.g., single-line) code generation benchmarks, since such tasks fail to represent real-world software development tasks. In addition, existing benchmarks often use poor code correctness metrics, providing misleading conclusions.
  To address these challenges, we create REPOCOD, a code generation benchmark with 980 problems collected from 11 popular real-world projects, with more than 58% of them requiring file-level or repository-level context information. In addition, REPOCOD has the longest average canonical solution length (331.6 tokens) and the highest average cyclomatic complexity (9.00) compared to existing benchmarks. Each task in REPOCOD includes 313.5 developer-written test cases on average for better correctness evaluation. In our evaluations of ten LLMs, none of the models achieve more than 30% pass@1 on REPOCOD, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development. REPOCOD is available at https://github.com/lt-asset/REPOCOD</description>

      <title>Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, in this paper we design a unified framework to measure object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to conduct hallucination evaluation on (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, and thus, could be easily generalized to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE and observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple yet effective training-free approach to mitigate hallucinations for LVLMs, with which, we exceed all open-sourced counterparts on Tri-HE, achieving comparable performance with the powerful GPT-4V. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.</description>

      <title>EMMA: End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built on a multi-modal large language model foundation, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can process only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D sensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive. We hope that our results will inspire further research to mitigate these issues and to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Contextual Speech Recognition Using Vector Quantization for Efficient Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing allows speech recognition models to leverage contextually relevant information, leading to improved transcription accuracy. However, the biasing mechanism is typically based on a cross-attention module between the audio and a catalogue of biasing entries, which means computational complexity can pose severe practical limitations on the size of the biasing catalogue and consequently on accuracy improvements. This work proposes an approximation to cross-attention scoring based on vector quantization and enables compute- and memory-efficient use of large biasing catalogues. We propose to use this technique jointly with a retrieval based contextual biasing approach. First, we use an efficient quantized retrieval module to shortlist biasing entries by grounding them on audio. Then we use retrieved entries for biasing. Since the proposed approach is agnostic to the biasing method, we investigate using full cross-attention, LLM prompting, and a combination of the two. We show that retrieval based shortlisting allows the system to efficiently leverage biasing catalogues of several thousands of entries, resulting in up to 71% relative error rate reduction in personal entity recognition. At the same time, the proposed approximation algorithm reduces compute time by 20% and memory usage by 85-95%, for lists of up to one million entries, when compared to standard dot-product cross-attention.</description>
