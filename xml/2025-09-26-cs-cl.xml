      <title>Automated Item Neutralization for Non-Cognitive Scales: A Large Language Model Approach to Reducing Social-Desirability Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates item neutralization assisted by the large language model (LLM) to reduce social desirability bias in personality assessment. GPT-o3 was used to rewrite the International Personality Item Pool Big Five Measure (IPIP-BFM-50), and 203 participants completed either the original or neutralized form along with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale. The results showed preserved reliability and a five-factor structure, with gains in Conscientiousness and declines in Agreeableness and Openness. The correlations with social desirability decreased for several items, but inconsistently. Configural invariance held, though metric and scalar invariance failed. Findings support AI neutralization as a potential but imperfect bias-reduction method.</description>

      <title>FHIR-AgentBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents for Realistic Interoperable EHR Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent shift toward the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard opens a new frontier for clinical AI, demanding LLM agents to navigate complex, resource-based data models instead of conventional structured health data. However, existing benchmarks have lagged behind this transition, lacking the realism needed to evaluate recent LLMs on interoperable clinical data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FHIR-AgentBench, a benchmark that grounds 2,931 real-world clinical questions in the HL7 FHIR standard. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate agentic frameworks, comparing different data retrieval strategies (direct FHIR API calls vs. specialized tools), interaction patterns (single-turn vs. multi-turn), and reasoning strategies (natural language vs. code generation). Our experiments highlight the practical challenges of retrieving data from intricate FHIR resources and the difficulty of reasoning over them, both of which critically affect question answering performance. We publicly release the FHIR-AgentBench dataset and evaluation suite (https://github.com/glee4810/FHIR-AgentBench) to promote reproducible research and the development of robust, reliable LLM agents for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Readme_AI: Dynamic Context Construction for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being trained on significant amounts of data, Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide inaccurate or unreliable information in the context of a user's specific query. Given query-specific context significantly improves the usefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can be used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner creates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about dataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created a prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the metadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some features that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that represent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading and parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and grouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for the LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this early prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library, for which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses containing hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that it is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code interpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by Hedgehog's developer. Our primary contribution is a extensible protocol for dynamically grounding LLMs in specialized, owner-provided data, enhancing responses from LLMs and reducing hallucinations. The source code for the Readme_AI tool is posted here: https://github.com/usnistgov/readme_ai .</description>

      <title>Magnitude Matters: a Superior Class of Similarity Metrics for Holistic Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector comparison in high dimensions is a fundamental task in NLP, yet it is dominated by two baselines: the raw dot product, which is unbounded and sensitive to vector norms, and the cosine similarity, which discards magnitude information entirely. This paper challenges both standards by proposing and rigorously evaluating a new class of parameter-free, magnitude-aware similarity metrics. I introduce two such functions, Overlap Similarity (OS) and Hyperbolic Tangent Similarity (HTS), designed to integrate vector magnitude and alignment in a more principled manner. To ensure that my findings are robust and generalizable, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation using four state-of-the-art sentence embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2, and BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) across a diverse suite of eight standard NLP benchmarks, including STS-B, SICK, Quora, and PAWS. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical significance, my results are definitive: on the tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding (paraphrase and inference), both OS and HTS provide a statistically significant improvement in Mean Squared Error over both the raw dot product and cosine similarity, regardless of the underlying embedding model.Crucially, my findings delineate the specific domain of advantage for these metrics: for tasks requiring holistic semantic understanding like paraphrase and inference, my magnitude-aware metrics offer a statistically superior alternative. This significant improvement was not observed on benchmarks designed to test highly nuanced compositional semantics (SICK, STS-B), identifying the challenge of representing compositional text as a distinct and important direction for future work.</description>

      <title>How Much of Your Data Can Suck? Thresholds for Domain Performance and Emergent Misalignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of incorrect data on the performance and safety of large language models (LLMs), specifically gpt-4o, during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Although LLMs become increasingly vital across broad domains like finance, coding, law, and health, fine-tuning on incorrect data can lead to "emergent misalignment," producing harmful or deceptive outputs unrelated to the intended task. We evaluate gpt-4o models fine-tuned with varying ratios (10\% to 90\% correct) of both obviously and subtly incorrect data across four domains: coding, finance, health, and legal. Our findings show that even modest amounts of incorrect data (10-25\%) dramatically degrade domain performance and not moral alignment. A clear threshold of at least 50\% correct data is needed for models to consistently recover strong performance, though they rarely match the robustness and safety of the base model, which exhibits near-perfect alignment and zero dangerous completions out-of-the-box. This research emphasizes that the cost of incorrect data is heavy, highlighting the critical need for extremely high-quality data curation or, alternatively, leveraging robust base models without unnecessary fine-tuning for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Merits and Defects of LLMs in Automatic Review Generation for Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in scientific submissions has placed increasing strain on the traditional peer-review process, prompting the exploration of large language models (LLMs) for automated review generation. While LLMs demonstrate competence in producing structured and coherent feedback, their capacity for critical reasoning, contextual grounding, and quality sensitivity remains limited. To systematically evaluate these aspects, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates semantic similarity analysis and structured knowledge graph metrics to assess LLM-generated reviews against human-written counterparts. We construct a large-scale benchmark of 1,683 papers and 6,495 expert reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS in multiple years, and generate reviews using five LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs perform well in descriptive and affirmational content, capturing the main contributions and methodologies of the original work, with GPT-4o highlighted as an illustrative example, generating 15.74% more entities than human reviewers in the strengths section of good papers in ICLR 2025. However, they consistently underperform in identifying weaknesses, raising substantive questions, and adjusting feedback based on paper quality. GPT-4o produces 59.42% fewer entities than real reviewers in the weaknesses and increases node count by only 5.7% from good to weak papers, compared to 50% in human reviews. Similar trends are observed across all conferences, years, and models, providing empirical foundations for understanding the merits and defects of LLM-generated reviews and informing the development of future LLM-assisted reviewing tools. Data, code, and more detailed results are publicly available at https://github.com/RichardLRC/Peer-Review.</description>

      <title>A systematic review of trial-matching pipelines using large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching patients to clinical trial options is critical for identifying novel treatments, especially in oncology. However, manual matching is labor-intensive and error-prone, leading to recruitment delays. Pipelines incorporating large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2020 and 2025 from three academic databases and one preprint server, identifying LLM-based approaches to clinical trial matching. Of 126 unique articles, 31 met inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies focused on matching patient-to-criterion only (n=4), patient-to-trial only (n=10), trial-to-patient only (n=2), binary eligibility classification only (n=1) or combined tasks (n=14). Sixteen used synthetic data; fourteen used real patient data; one used both. Variability in datasets and evaluation metrics limited cross-study comparability. In studies with direct comparisons, the GPT-4 model consistently outperformed other models, even finely-tuned ones, in matching and eligibility extraction, albeit at higher cost. Promising strategies included zero-shot prompting with proprietary LLMs like the GPT-4o model, advanced retrieval methods, and fine-tuning smaller, open-source models for data privacy when incorporation of large models into hospital infrastructure is infeasible. Key challenges include accessing sufficiently large real-world data sets, and deployment-associated challenges such as reducing cost, mitigating risk of hallucinations, data leakage, and bias. This review synthesizes progress in applying LLMs to clinical trial matching, highlighting promising directions and key limitations. Standardized metrics, more realistic test sets, and attention to cost-efficiency and fairness will be critical for broader deployment.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Compositionality of Classic and State-of-the-Art Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For language models to generalize correctly to novel expressions, it is critical that they exploit access compositional meanings when this is justified. Even if we don't know what a "pelp" is, we can use our knowledge of numbers to understand that "ten pelps" makes more pelps than "two pelps". Static word embeddings such as Word2vec made strong, indeed excessive, claims about compositionality. The SOTA generative, transformer models and graph models, however, go too far in the other direction by providing no real limits on shifts in meaning due to context. To quantify the additive compositionality, we formalize a two-step, generalized evaluation that (i) measures the linearity between known entity attributes and their embeddings via canonical correlation analysis, and (ii) evaluates additive generalization by reconstructing embeddings for unseen attribute combinations and checking reconstruction metrics such as L2 loss, cosine similarity, and retrieval accuracy. These metrics also capture failure cases where linear composition breaks down. Sentences, knowledge graphs, and word embeddings are evaluated and tracked the compositionality across all layers and training stages. Stronger compositional signals are observed in later training stages across data modalities, and in deeper layers of the transformer-based model before a decline at the top layer. Code is available at https://github.com/Zhijin-Guo1/quantifying-compositionality.</description>

      <title>Pluralistic Off-policy Evaluation and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized preference alignment for LLMs with diverse human preferences requires evaluation and alignment methods that capture pluralism. Most existing preference alignment datasets are logged under policies that differ substantially from the evaluated LLMs, and existing off-policy estimators focus solely on overall utility while ignoring preference pluralism. Extending Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore, remains an open question. Thus, we propose the Pluralistic Off-Policy Evaluation (POPE), the first framework for offline pluralistic preference evaluation and alignment in LLMs. POPE includes a unified reward function that combines (1) a collaborative utility component derived from human preference signals (e.g., upvotes or relevance scores) and (2) a diversity component inspired by entropy-based coverage measures, together reflecting pluralistic alignment. Furthermore, to estimate this reward from logged interactions, we derive decomposable inverse propensity scoring (IPS) estimators that separately evaluate relevance and diversity. Theoretically, we prove that our decomposed IPS estimators establish a lower bound on their variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance pluralistic alignment. Empirical results demonstrate that POPE efficiently enhances pluralistic response generation and maintains the models' general capabilities on downstream tasks</description>

      <title>Cognitive-Level Adaptive Generation via Capability-Aware Retrieval and Style Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in open-ended generation tasks. However, they often struggle to adapt content to users with differing cognitive capacities, leading to a phenomenon we term cognitive misalignment. This issue arises in two forms: knowledge-level misalignment, where content is too complex or too simplistic relative to user understanding, and presentation-style misalignment, where the structure or tone hinders effective comprehension. To address these challenges, we propose the Cognitive-Level Alignment Framework (CLAF), a general-purpose generation framework that aligns both knowledge complexity and presentation style with user cognition. CLAF integrates a capability-aware retrieval module based on a hierarchical knowledge graph and a style optimization module guided by Bloom's taxonomy and preference learning. Additionally, a knowledge-controllable generation component ensures consistency and relevance throughout the output. To support training and evaluation, we construct SCALE, a cognitively annotated dataset containing responses at multiple comprehension levels per query. Empirical results show that CLAF enhances the adaptability and informativeness of LLM outputs across a range of user profiles, offering a robust solution to cognitive-level alignment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Part-of-speech tagging for Nagamese Language using CRF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language, a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF, an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85% is achieved.
  Keywords. Nagamese, NLP, part-of-speech, machine learning, CRF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have been tested on medical student-level questions, but their performance in specialized fields like Critical Care Medicine (CCM) is less explored. This study evaluated Meta-Llama 3.1 models (8B and 70B parameters) on 871 CCM questions. Llama3.1:70B outperformed 8B by 30%, with 60% average accuracy. Performance varied across domains, highest in Research (68.4%) and lowest in Renal (47.9%), highlighting the need for broader future work to improve models across various subspecialty domains.</description>

      <title>SCORE: A Semantic Evaluation Framework for Generative Document Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal generative document parsing systems challenge traditional evaluation: unlike deterministic OCR or layout models, they often produce semantically correct yet structurally divergent outputs. Conventional metrics-CER, WER, IoU, or TEDS-misclassify such diversity as error, penalizing valid interpretations and obscuring system behavior.
  We introduce SCORE (Structural and COntent Robust Evaluation), an interpretation-agnostic framework that integrates (i) adjusted edit distance for robust content fidelity, (ii) token-level diagnostics to distinguish hallucinations from omissions, (iii) table evaluation with spatial tolerance and semantic alignment, and (iv) hierarchy-aware consistency checks. Together, these dimensions enable evaluation that embraces representational diversity while enforcing semantic rigor.
  Across 1,114 pages spanning a holistic benchmark and a field dataset, SCORE consistently revealed cross-dataset performance patterns missed by standard metrics. In 2-5% of pages with ambiguous table structures, traditional metrics penalized systems by 12-25% on average, leading to distorted rankings. SCORE corrected these cases, recovering equivalence between alternative but valid interpretations. Moreover, by normalizing generative outputs into a format-agnostic representation, SCORE reproduces traditional scores (e.g., table F1 up to 0.93) without requiring object-detection pipelines, demonstrating that generative parsing alone suffices for comprehensive evaluation.
  By exposing how interpretive diversity impacts evaluation outcomes and providing multi-dimensional, interpretable diagnostics, SCORE establishes foundational principles for semantically grounded, fair, and practical benchmarking of modern document parsing systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking ChatGPT and DeepSeek in April 2025: A Novel Dual Perspective Sentiment Analysis Using Lexicon-Based and Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel dual-perspective approach to analyzing user reviews for ChatGPT and DeepSeek on the Google Play Store, integrating lexicon-based sentiment analysis (TextBlob) with deep learning classification models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) Networks. Unlike prior research, which focuses on either lexicon-based strategies or predictive deep learning models in isolation, this study conducts an extensive investigation into user satisfaction with Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. A Dataset of 4,000 authentic user reviews was collected, which were carefully preprocessed and subjected to oversampling to achieve balanced classes. The balanced test set of 1,700 Reviews were used for model testing. Results from the experiments reveal that ChatGPT received significantly more positive sentiment than DeepSeek. Furthermore, deep learning based classification demonstrated superior performance over lexicon analysis, with CNN outperforming Bi-LSTM by achieving 96.41 percent accuracy and near perfect classification of negative reviews, alongside high F1-scores for neutral and positive sentiments. This research sets a new methodological standard for measuring sentiment in LLM-based applications and provides practical insights for developers and researchers seeking to improve user-centric AI system design.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Knowledge Graph Tasks in LLM Benchmarks Using Cognitive Complexity Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks involving Knowledge Graphs (KGs), whose evaluation typically focuses on accuracy and output correctness. We propose a complementary task characterization approach using three complexity frameworks from cognitive psychology. Applying this to the LLM-KG-Bench framework, we highlight value distributions, identify underrepresented demands and motivate richer interpretation and diversity for benchmark evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>ShinkaEvolve: Towards Open-Ended And Sample-Efficient Program Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.</description>

      <title>TriSPrompt: A Hierarchical Soft Prompt Model for Multimodal Rumor Detection with Incomplete Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread presence of incomplete modalities in multimodal data poses a significant challenge to achieving accurate rumor detection. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods primarily focus on learning joint modality representations from \emph{complete} multimodal training data, rendering them ineffective in addressing the common occurrence of \emph{missing modalities} in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical soft prompt model \textsf{TriSPrompt}, which integrates three types of prompts, \textit{i.e.}, \emph{modality-aware} (MA) prompt, \emph{modality-missing} (MM) prompt, and \emph{mutual-views} (MV) prompt, to effectively detect rumors in incomplete multimodal data. The MA prompt captures both heterogeneous information from specific modalities and homogeneous features from available data, aiding in modality recovery. The MM prompt models missing states in incomplete data, enhancing the model's adaptability to missing information. The MV prompt learns relationships between subjective (\textit{i.e.}, text and image) and objective (\textit{i.e.}, comments) perspectives, effectively detecting rumors. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that \textsf{TriSPrompt} achieves an accuracy gain of over 13\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>RoadMind: Towards a Geospatial AI Expert for Disaster Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of natural language tasks, but remain limited in their ability to reason about geospatial data, particularly road networks, distances, and directions. This gap poses challenges in disaster scenarios, where spatial understanding is critical for tasks such as evacuation planning and resource allocation. In this work, we present RoadMind, a self-supervised framework that enhances the geospatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs using structured data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Our automated pipeline extracts road infrastructure data for a given city and converts it into multiple supervision formats tailored to key spatial tasks. We pretrain and fine-tune LLMs on these representations using QLoRA adapters and 4-bit quantized models. We evaluate our approach on three disaster-prone cities with varying global representation, Los Angeles, Christchurch, and Manila, across tasks such as road segment identification, nearest road retrieval, and distance/direction estimation. Our results show that models trained via RoadMind significantly outperform strong baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs equipped with advanced prompt engineering. This demonstrates the potential of structured geospatial data to enhance language models with robust spatial reasoning, enabling more effective offline AI systems for disaster response.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Improving LLM Robustness for Personalized Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in personalizing the responses of large language models (LLMs). While existing evaluations primarily focus on whether a response aligns with a user's preferences, we argue that factuality is an equally important yet often overlooked dimension. In the context of personalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both factually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we introduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along with a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different model families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that current LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models (GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously successful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale) can fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is significantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user preference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage approach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work highlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools and metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments.</description>

      <title>Semantic Representation Attack against Aligned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure, here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Inadequacy of Offline LLM Evaluations: A Need to Account for Personalization in Model Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard offline evaluations for language models -- a series of independent, state-less inferences made by models -- fail to capture how language models actually behave in practice, where personalization fundamentally alters model behavior. For instance, identical benchmark questions to the same language model can produce markedly different responses when prompted to a state-less system, in one user's chat session, or in a different user's chat session. In this work, we provide empirical evidence showcasing this phenomenon by comparing offline evaluations to field evaluations conducted by having 800 real users of ChatGPT and Gemini pose benchmark and other provided questions to their chat interfaces.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Topic Reduction for BERTopic on Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling. However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead, limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases, coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Pipeline Parallelism is All You Need for Optimized Early-Exit Based Self-Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive generation quality, but incur very high inference cost because each output token is generated auto-regressively through all model layers. Early-exit based self-speculative decoding (EESD) has emerged to mitigate this cost. However, in practice, many approaches struggle to achieve the expected acceleration in such draft-then-verify paradigm even with a well-aligned early-exit head and selected exit position. Our analysis reveals that EESD only pays off when the vast majority of draft tokens are accepted by the LLM. Otherwise, the draft cost may overcome the acceleration gain and lead to a negative speedup. To mitigate this, we propose Pipeline-Parallel Self-Speculative Decoding (PPSD) that fully pipelines the draft and verification work so that no effort is wasted on failed predictions. It has two key innovations. We configure the model layers as a pipeline in which early-exit (draft) computations and remaining-layer (verification) computations overlap. We interleave drafting and verification per token. While the LLM is verifying the current token in its final layers, the early-exit path simultaneously drafts the next token. Such a verify-while-draft scheme keeps all units busy and validates tokens on-the-fly analogous to pipelining the speculation and verification stages. Empirical results confirm that PPSD achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in self-speculative LLM inference. On diverse benchmarks, PPSD achieves speedup ratios in the range of 2.01x~3.81x, which gains almost the optimal acceleration at the fixed acceptance rate and exit position, showcasing its advancement in providing efficient self-speculation.</description>

      <title>SLM-Based Agentic AI with P-C-G: Optimized for Korean Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a small-scale language model (SLM) based agent architecture, Planner-Caller-Generator (P-C-G), optimized for Korean tool use. P-C-G separates planning, calling, and generation by role: the Planner produces an initial batch plan with limited on-demand replanning; the Caller returns a normalized call object after joint schema-value validation; and the Generator integrates tool outputs to produce the final answer. We apply a Korean-first value policy to reduce execution failures caused by frequent Korean-to-English code switching in Korean settings. Evaluation assumes Korean queries and Korean tool/parameter specifications; it covers single-chain, multi-chain, missing-parameters, and missing-functions scenarios, and is conducted via an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol averaged over five runs under a unified I/O interface. Results show that P-C-G delivers competitive tool-use accuracy and end-to-end quality while reducing tokens and maintaining acceptable latency, indicating that role-specialized SLMs are a cost-effective alternative for Korean tool-use agents.</description>

      <title>Meow: End-to-End Outline Writing for Automatic Academic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As academic paper publication numbers grow exponentially, conducting in-depth surveys with LLMs automatically has become an inevitable trend. Outline writing, which aims to systematically organize related works, is critical for automated survey generation. Yet existing automatic survey methods treat outline writing as mere workflow steps in the overall pipeline. Such template-based workflows produce outlines that lack in-depth understanding of the survey topic and fine-grained styles. To address these limitations, we propose Meow, the first metadata-driven outline writing framework that produces organized and faithful outlines efficiently. Specifically, we first formulate outline writing as an end-to-end task that generates hierarchical structured outlines from paper metadata. We then curate a high-quality dataset of surveys from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, and establish systematic evaluation metrics for outline quality assessment. Finally, we employ a two-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our 8B reasoning model demonstrates strong performance with high structural fidelity and stylistic coherence.</description>

      <title>How to inject knowledge efficiently? Knowledge Infusion Scaling Law for Pre-training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point: each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts. Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.</description>

      <title>A Pipeline to Assess Merging Methods via Behavior and Internals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging methods combine the weights of multiple language models (LMs) to leverage their capacities, such as for domain adaptation. While existing studies investigate merged models from a solely behavioral perspective, we offer the first comprehensive view by assessing and connecting their behavior and internals. We present a novel evaluation pipeline that first merges multiple parent LMs, and then evaluates the merged models in comparison to the initial ones based on their behavior on downstream tasks, like MMLU, and the internal encoded linguistic competence. We showcase this pipeline by assessing the merging of instruction fine-tuned with math- and code-adapted LMs from the Qwen2.5 family. Our results show that merging methods impacts behavior and internals differently. While the performance of merged models is typically between that of the two parent models, their encoded information about linguistic phenomena, particularly in morphology and syntax, can surpass the parent models. Moreover, we find weak ranking correlation between this behavior and internal evaluation. With our pipeline and initial results, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluations of model merging methods to gain a faithful understanding of their capabilities and reliability, beyond potential superficial behavioral advances.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Encode Frame Semantics? Evidence from Frame Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19540</link>

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models encode latent knowledge of frame semantics, focusing on frame identification, a core challenge in frame semantic parsing that involves selecting the appropriate semantic frame for a target word in context. Using the FrameNet lexical resource, we evaluate models under prompt-based inference and observe that they can perform frame identification effectively even without explicit supervision. To assess the impact of task-specific training, we fine-tune the model on FrameNet data, which substantially improves in-domain accuracy while generalizing well to out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that the models can generate semantically coherent frame definitions, highlighting the model's internalized understanding of frame semantics.</description>

      <title>Confidence Calibration in Large Language Model-Based Entity Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Semantic Language Modeling with PIXELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3 semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation based context discovery for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates retrieval augmented generation as an efficient strategy for automatic context discovery in context-aware Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, in order to improve transcription accuracy in the presence of rare or out-of-vocabulary terms. However, identifying the right context automatically remains an open challenge. This work proposes an efficient embedding-based retrieval approach for automatic context discovery in ASR. To contextualize its effectiveness, two alternatives based on large language models (LLMs) are also evaluated: (1) large language model (LLM)-based context generation via prompting, and (2) post-recognition transcript correction using LLMs. Experiments on the TED-LIUMv3, Earnings21 and SPGISpeech demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces WER by up to 17% (percentage difference) relative to using no-context, while the oracle context results in a reduction of up to 24.1%.</description>

      <title>ExPe: Exact Positional Encodings for Generative Transformer Models with Extrapolating Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to position embeddings in transformer models, named "Exact Positional Embeddings" (ExPE). An absolute positional embedding method that can extrapolate to sequences of lengths longer than the ones it was trained on. Traditional transformer models rely on absolute or relative position embeddings to incorporate positional information into token embeddings, which often struggle with extrapolation to sequences longer than those seen during training. Our proposed method utilizes a novel embedding strategy that encodes exact positional information by overriding specific dimensions of the embedding vectors, thereby enabling a more precise representation of token positions. The proposed approach not only maintains the integrity of the original embeddings but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to more extended sequences. In causal language modeling, our ExPE embeddings significantly reduce perplexity compared to rotary and sinusoidal embeddings, when tested on sequences longer than those used in training.</description>

      <title>LLMs4All: A Review on Large Language Models for Research and Applications in Academic Disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.</description>

      <title>GuessingGame: Measuring the Informativeness of Open-Ended Questions in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GuessingGame, a protocol for evaluating large language models (LLMs) as strategic question-askers in open-ended, open-domain settings. A Guesser LLM identifies a hidden object by posing free-form questions to an Oracle without predefined choices or candidate lists. To measure question quality, we propose two information gain (IG) metrics: a Bayesian method that tracks belief updates over semantic concepts using LLM-scored relevance, and an entropy-based method that filters candidates via ConceptNet. Both metrics are model-agnostic and support post hoc analysis. Across 858 games with multiple models and prompting strategies, higher IG strongly predicts efficiency: a one-standard-deviation IG increase reduces expected game length by 43\%. Prompting constraints guided by IG, such as enforcing question diversity, enable weaker models to significantly improve performance. These results show that question-asking in LLMs is both measurable and improvable, and crucial for interactive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Feeling: Narrating Embodied Emotions via Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The embodiment of emotional reactions from body parts contains rich information about our affective experiences. We propose a framework that utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to generate Embodied LVLM Emotion Narratives (ELENA). These are well-defined, multi-layered text outputs, primarily comprising descriptions that focus on the salient body parts involved in emotional reactions. We also employ attention maps and observe that contemporary models exhibit a persistent bias towards the facial region. Despite this limitation, we observe that our employed framework can effectively recognize embodied emotions in face-masked images, outperforming baselines without any fine-tuning. ELENA opens a new trajectory for embodied emotion analysis across the modality of vision and enriches modeling in an affect-aware setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our ability to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of machine translation systems has been outrun by the effectiveness of current language models--which limits the potential for further improving these models on more challenging tasks like long-form and literary translation. We propose an unsupervised method to generate training data for translation evaluation over different document lengths and application domains by repeated rounds of translation between source and target languages. We evaluate evaluation systems trained on texts mechanically generated using both model rotation and language translation approaches, demonstrating improved performance over a popular translation evaluation system (xCOMET) on two different tasks: (i) scoring the quality of a given translation against a human reference and (ii) selecting which of two translations is generationally closer to an original source document.</description>

      <title>AutoSpec: An Agentic Framework for Automatically Drafting Patent Specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patents play a critical role in driving technological innovation by granting inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. However the process of drafting a patent application is often expensive and time-consuming, making it a prime candidate for automation. Despite recent advancements in language models, several challenges hinder the development of robust automated patent drafting systems. First, the information within a patent application is highly confidential, which often prevents the use of closed-source LLMs for automating this task. Second, the process of drafting a patent application is difficult for even the most advanced language models due to their long context, technical writing style, and specialized domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce AutoSpec, a secure, agentic framework for Automatically drafting patent Specification. Our approach decomposes the drafting process into a sequence of manageable subtasks, each solvable by smaller, open-source language models enhanced with custom tools tailored for drafting patent specification. To assess our system, we design a novel evaluation protocol in collaboration with experienced patent attorneys. Our automatic and expert evaluations show that AutoSpec outperforms existing baselines on a patent drafting task.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Pedestrian Safety: An Application to Predicting Driver Yielding Behavior at Unsignalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian safety is a critical component of urban mobility and is strongly influenced by the interactions between pedestrian decision-making and driver yielding behavior at crosswalks. Modeling driver--pedestrian interactions at intersections requires accurately capturing the complexity of these behaviors. Traditional machine learning models often struggle to capture the nuanced and context-dependent reasoning required for these multifactorial interactions, due to their reliance on fixed feature representations and limited interpretability. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) are suited for extracting patterns from heterogeneous traffic data, enabling accurate modeling of driver-pedestrian interactions. Therefore, this paper leverages multimodal LLMs through a novel prompt design that incorporates domain-specific knowledge, structured reasoning, and few-shot prompting, enabling interpretable and context-aware inference of driver yielding behavior, as an example application of modeling pedestrian--driver interaction. We benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against traditional classifiers, finding that GPT-4o consistently achieves the highest accuracy and recall, while Deepseek-V3 excels in precision. These findings highlight the critical trade-offs between model performance and computational efficiency, offering practical guidance for deploying LLMs in real-world pedestrian safety systems.</description>

      <title>DyBBT: Dynamic Balance via Bandit inspired Targeting for Dialog Policy with Cognitive Dual-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task oriented dialog systems often rely on static exploration strategies that do not adapt to dynamic dialog contexts, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal performance. We propose DyBBT, a novel dialog policy learning framework that formalizes the exploration challenge through a structured cognitive state space capturing dialog progression, user uncertainty, and slot dependency. DyBBT proposes a bandit inspired meta-controller that dynamically switches between a fast intuitive inference (System 1) and a slow deliberative reasoner (System 2) based on real-time cognitive states and visitation counts. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-domain benchmarks show that DyBBT achieves state-of-the-art performance in success rate, efficiency, and generalization, with human evaluations confirming its decisions are well aligned with expert judgment.

      <title>Personality Vector: Modulating Personality of Large Language Models by Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the demand for personalized AI systems, there is growing interest in aligning the behavior of large language models (LLMs) with human traits such as personality. Previous attempts to induce personality in LLMs have shown promising results, but they struggle to capture the continuous and multidimensional nature of human traits. In this work, we propose a novel method for personality modulation in LLMs via model merging. Specifically, we construct personality vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from those of the fine-tuned model on a given personality trait. By merging personality vectors, we enable LLMs to exhibit desired personality traits without additional training. Extensive experiments show that personality vectors enable continuous control over trait intensity and support the composition of multiple traits. Furthermore, personality vectors transfer across diverse downstream models, suggesting that they encode generalizable representations of personality. Our code is available at here.</description>

      <title>HiCoLoRA: Addressing Context-Prompt Misalignment via Hierarchical Collaborative LoRA for Zero-Shot DST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Dialog State Tracking (zs-DST) is essential for enabling Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODs) to generalize to new domains without costly data annotation. A central challenge lies in the semantic misalignment between dynamic dialog contexts and static prompts, leading to inflexible cross-layer coordination, domain interference, and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this, we propose Hierarchical Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation (HiCoLoRA), a framework that enhances zero-shot slot inference through robust prompt alignment. It features a hierarchical LoRA architecture for dynamic layer-specific processing (combining lower-layer heuristic grouping and higher-layer full interaction), integrates Spectral Joint Domain-Slot Clustering to identify transferable associations (feeding an Adaptive Linear Fusion Mechanism), and employs Semantic-Enhanced SVD Initialization (SemSVD-Init) to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Experiments on multi-domain datasets MultiWOZ and SGD show that HiCoLoRA outperforms baselines, achieving SOTA in zs-DST. Code is available at https://github.com/carsonz/HiCoLoRA.</description>

      <title>PART: Progressive Alignment Representation Training for Multilingual Speech-To-Text with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding. Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech modality alignment.</description>

      <title>CHURRO: Making History Readable with an Open-Weight Large Vision-Language Model for High-Accuracy, Low-Cost Historical Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate text recognition for historical documents can greatly advance the study and preservation of cultural heritage. Existing vision-language models (VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and frequent degradation found in historical materials.
  This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages.
  We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and 70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being 15.5 times more cost-effective.
  By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven research to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate scholarship.</description>

      <title>EnAnchored-X2X: English-Anchored Optimization for Many-to-Many Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong machine translation capabilities for English-centric language pairs but underperform in direct non-English (x2x) translation. This work addresses this limitation through a synthetic data generation framework that leverages models' established English-to-x (en2x) capabilities. By extending English parallel corpora into omnidirectional datasets and developing an English-referenced quality evaluation proxy, we enable effective collection of high-quality x2x training data. Combined with preference-based optimization, our method achieves significant improvement across 72 x2x directions for widely used LLMs, while generalizing to enhance en2x performance. The results demonstrate that strategic exploitation of English-centric strengths can bootstrap comprehensive multilingual translation capabilities in LLMs. We release codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/NJUNLP/EAX</description>

      <title>bi-GRPO: Bidirectional Optimization for Jailbreak Backdoor Injection on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (&gt;99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>Polarity Detection of Sustainable Detection Goals in News Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive, neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land). Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.</description>

      <title>TianHui: A Domain-Specific Large Language Model for Diverse Traditional Chinese Medicine Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific LLMs in TCM face limitations in research settings due to constrained adaptability, insufficient evaluation datasets, and limited computational resources. This study presents TianHui, a specialized TCM LLM built through contextual data integration and domain knowledge fusion. We constructed a large-scale TCM corpus (0.97GB unsupervised data + 611,312 QA pairs) and employed a two-stage training strategy with QLoRA, DeepSpeed Stage 2, and Flash Attention 2. Evaluation on 12 benchmarks showed TianHui ranked top-three in all metrics for six datasets (APQ, TCMCD, HFR, HCCA, DHPE, TLAW) and achieved top results in the other six (TCMEE, APR, GCPMI, TCMKQA, TCMRC, ADTG). Optimal configuration was identified as LoRA rank=128, alpha=256, epoch=4, dropout=0.2, max length=2048. TianHui enables systematic preservation and scalable application of TCM knowledge. All resources are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Mah\={a}n\={a}ma: A Unique Testbed for Literary Entity Discovery and Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High lexical variation, ambiguous references, and long-range dependencies make entity resolution in literary texts particularly challenging. We present Mah\={a}n\={a}ma, the first large-scale dataset for end-to-end Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) in Sanskrit, a morphologically rich and under-resourced language. Derived from the Mah\={a}bh\={a}rata, the world's longest epic, the dataset comprises over 109K named entity mentions mapped to 5.5K unique entities, and is aligned with an English knowledge base to support cross-lingual linking. The complex narrative structure of Mah\={a}n\={a}ma, coupled with extensive name variation and ambiguity, poses significant challenges to resolution systems. Our evaluation reveals that current coreference and entity linking models struggle when evaluated on the global context of the test set. These results highlight the limitations of current approaches in resolving entities within such complex discourse. Mah\=an\=ama thus provides a unique benchmark for advancing entity resolution, especially in literary domains.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>SINAI at eRisk@CLEF 2025: Transformer-Based and Conversational Strategies for Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the participation of the SINAI-UJA team in the eRisk@CLEF 2025 lab. Specifically, we addressed two of the proposed tasks: (i) Task 2: Contextualized Early Detection of Depression, and (ii) Pilot Task: Conversational Depression Detection via LLMs. Our approach for Task 2 combines an extensive preprocessing pipeline with the use of several transformer-based models, such as RoBERTa Base or MentalRoBERTA Large, to capture the contextual and sequential nature of multi-user conversations. For the Pilot Task, we designed a set of conversational strategies to interact with LLM-powered personas, focusing on maximizing information gain within a limited number of dialogue turns. In Task 2, our system ranked 8th out of 12 participating teams based on F1 score. However, a deeper analysis revealed that our models were among the fastest in issuing early predictions, which is a critical factor in real-world deployment scenarios. This highlights the trade-off between early detection and classification accuracy, suggesting potential avenues for optimizing both jointly in future work. In the Pilot Task, we achieved 1st place out of 5 teams, obtaining the best overall performance across all evaluation metrics: DCHR, ADODL and ASHR. Our success in this task demonstrates the effectiveness of structured conversational design when combined with powerful language models, reinforcing the feasibility of deploying LLMs in sensitive mental health assessment contexts.</description>

      <title>SwissGPC v1.0 -- The Swiss German Podcasts Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SwissGPC v1.0, the first mid-to-large-scale corpus of spontaneous Swiss German speech, developed to support research in ASR, TTS, dialect identification, and related fields. The dataset consists of links to talk shows and podcasts hosted on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen and YouTube, which contain approximately 5400 hours of raw audio. After segmentation and weak annotation, nearly 5000 hours of speech were retained, covering the seven major Swiss German dialect regions alongside Standard German. We describe the corpus construction methodology, including an automated annotation pipeline, and provide statistics on dialect distribution, token counts, and segmentation characteristics. Unlike existing Swiss German speech corpora, which primarily feature controlled speech, this corpus captures natural, spontaneous conversations, making it a valuable resource for real-world speech applications.</description>

      <title>Do Before You Judge: Self-Reference as a Pathway to Better LLM Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-as-Judge frameworks are increasingly popular for AI evaluation, yet research findings on the relationship between models' generation and judgment abilities remain inconsistent. We investigate this relationship through systematic dataset- and instance-level analyses across 11 models and 21 diverse tasks. Despite both capabilities relying on the same underlying knowledge, our analyses reveal they are only weakly correlated, primarily due to LLMs' sensitivity to the responses being judged. To address this, we propose a self-reference-guided evaluation strategy that leverages a model's own answers as references. This approach significantly strengthens the correlation between generation and judgment abilities, offering a practical path to align these skills and providing a reliable proxy for model selection in evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>Future Policy Aware Preference Learning for Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become standard for Large Language Model (LLM) post-training, yet they are often ineffective for mathematical reasoning. A key challenge is the large token overlap between preferred and dispreferred trajectories; lowering the probability of dispreferred trajectories also reduces the probability of shared useful tokens, leading to over-penalization and overall performance collapse. As a mitigation, existing algorithms include the probability of a trajectory under the current policy as a regularization term, which decreases the effect of the gradient when the probability is low. However, by the time this effect takes hold, useful tokens may have already been over-penalized as the model has begun to degrade. To address this, we propose Future Policy Aware (FPA) preference learning, which replaces the current policy with a future policy in the regularization term. This future policy is estimated via lightweight, logit-space extrapolation from a reference model toward the current model. FPA enables safer training by preemptively regularizing potentially problematic gradients. We apply FPA to DPO, RPO, and SimPER and evaluate them on the MATH and GSM8K benchmarks. FPA yields consistent performance gains, with the largest improvements observed with SimPER, achieving gains of up to 5.75%. We demonstrate that FPA provides proactive regularization while preserving the probability of shared, useful mathematical tokens, and enables longer, degradation-free training with negligible computational overhead. We will release our code publicly upon publication.</description>

      <title>WEST: LLM based Speech Toolkit for Speech Understanding, Generation, and Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present WEST(WE Speech Toolkit), a speech toolkit based on a large language model (LLM) for speech understanding, generation, and interaction. There are three key features of WEST: 1) Fully LLM-based: Standing on the shoulders of giants by reusing mature architectures, ecosystems (e.g., Hugging Face), and methods (e.g., sequence packing) from large models. 2) Full-stack: Supports tasks such as recognition, synthesis, understanding, dialogue, and multimodal capabilities, with extensibility to incorporate open-source models. 3) Simple and Stupid: A simple and stupid speech toolkit that everyone can Touch. In addition, WEST provides two types of recipes, models, and experimental results. The first is entirely based on open-source models and open-source data, allowing users to fully reproduce the experiments in this paper and serving as a verification system or minimal system baseline. The second is trained on massive data, offering superior performance so the user can directly apply it out of the box. WEST is publicly avilable at https://github.com/wenet-e2e/west/</description>

      <title>CorIL: Towards Enriching Indian Language to Indian Language Parallel Corpora and Machine Translation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India's linguistic landscape is one of the most diverse in the world, comprising over 120 major languages and approximately 1,600 additional languages, with 22 officially recognized as scheduled languages in the Indian Constitution. Despite recent progress in multilingual neural machine translation (NMT), high-quality parallel corpora for Indian languages remain scarce, especially across varied domains. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality annotated parallel corpus covering 11 of these languages : English, Telugu, Hindi, Punjabi, Odia, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Dogri, Kannada, Urdu, and Gujarati comprising a total of 772,000 bi-text sentence pairs. The dataset is carefully curated and systematically categorized into three key domains: Government, Health, and General, to enable domain-aware machine translation research and facilitate effective domain adaptation. To demonstrate the utility of CorIL and establish strong benchmarks for future research, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art NMT models, including IndicTrans2, NLLB, and BhashaVerse. Our analysis reveals important performance trends and highlights the corpus's value in probing model capabilities. For instance, the results show distinct performance patterns based on language script, with massively multilingual models showing an advantage on Perso-Arabic scripts (Urdu, Sindhi) while other models excel on Indic scripts. This paper provides a detailed domain-wise performance analysis, offering insights into domain sensitivity and cross-script transfer learning. By publicly releasing CorIL, we aim to significantly improve the availability of high-quality training data for Indian languages and provide a valuable resource for the machine translation research community.</description>

      <title>The Knowledge-Behaviour Disconnect in LLM-based Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based artificial conversational agents (like ChatGPT) give answers to all kinds of questions, and often enough these answers are correct. Just on the basis of that capacity alone, we may attribute knowledge to them. But do these models use this knowledge as a basis for their own conversational behaviour? I argue this is not the case, and I will refer to this failure as a `disconnect'. I further argue this disconnect is fundamental in the sense that with more data and more training of the LLM on which a conversational chatbot is based, it will not disappear. The reason is, as I will claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the establishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a fundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of hallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the disconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical conversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with several additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will discuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it worse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many IoT applications, the central interest lies not in individual sensor signals but in their differences, yet interpreting such differences requires expert knowledge. We propose DiffNator, a framework for structured explanations of differences between two time series. We first design a JSON schema that captures the essential properties of such differences. Using the Time-series Observations of Real-world IoT (TORI) dataset, we generate paired sequences and train a model that combine a time-series encoder with a frozen LLM to output JSON-formatted explanations. Experimental results show that DiffNator generates accurate difference explanations and substantially outperforms both a visual question answering (VQA) baseline and a retrieval method using a pre-trained time-series encoder.</description>

Abstract: Dialectal data are characterized by linguistic variation that appears small to humans but has a significant impact on the performance of models. This dialect gap has been related to various factors (e.g., data size, economic and social factors) whose impact, however, turns out to be inconsistent. In this work, we investigate factors impacting the model performance more directly: we correlate Tokenization Parity (TP) and Information Parity (IP), as measures of representational biases in pre-trained multilingual models, with the downstream performance. We compare state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs with encoder-based models across three tasks: dialect classification, topic classification, and extractive question answering, controlling for varying scripts (Latin vs. non-Latin) and resource availability (high vs. low). Our analysis reveals that TP is a better predictor of the performance on tasks reliant on syntactic and morphological cues (e.g., extractive QA), while IP better predicts performance in semantic tasks (e.g., topic classification). Complementary analyses, including tokenizer behavior, vocabulary coverage, and qualitative insights, reveal that the language support claims of LLMs often might mask deeper mismatches at the script or token level.</description>

Abstract: KT developed a Responsible AI (RAI) assessment methodology and risk mitigation technologies to ensure the safety and reliability of AI services. By analyzing the Basic Act on AI implementation and global AI governance trends, we established a unique approach for regulatory compliance and systematically identify and manage all potential risk factors from AI development to operation. We present a reliable assessment methodology that systematically verifies model safety and robustness based on KT's AI risk taxonomy tailored to the domestic environment. We also provide practical tools for managing and mitigating identified AI risks. With the release of this report, we also release proprietary Guardrail : SafetyGuard that blocks harmful responses from AI models in real-time, supporting the enhancement of safety in the domestic AI development ecosystem. We also believe these research outcomes provide valuable insights for organizations seeking to develop Responsible AI.</description>

      <title>From Input Perception to Predictive Insight: Modeling Model Blind Spots Before They Become Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models often struggle with idiomatic, figurative, or context-sensitive inputs, not because they produce flawed outputs, but because they misinterpret the input from the outset. We propose an input-only method for anticipating such failures using token-level likelihood features inspired by surprisal and the Uniform Information Density hypothesis. These features capture localized uncertainty in input comprehension and outperform standard baselines across five linguistically challenging datasets. We show that span-localized features improve error detection for larger models, while smaller models benefit from global patterns. Our method requires no access to outputs or hidden activations, offering a lightweight and generalizable approach to pre-generation error prediction.</description>

      <title>From Text to Talk: Audio-Language Model Needs Non-Autoregressive Joint Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have attracted significant interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for speech-in speech-out conversational systems. However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text, such as MOSHI require complex multi stage training pipelines, incurring substantial computational costs. Moreover, these models uniformly apply autoregressive generation to both text and audio tokens, overlooking a fundamental asymmetry in their dependency structures: while text tokens exhibit strong target target dependencies requiring causal ordering, audio tokens are predominantly driven by source target dependencies, where audio outputs primarily condition on source text rather than preceding audio tokens. In this work, we propose TtT, a unified audio-text modeling framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive audio diffusion within a single Transformer architecture initialized from a pretrained LLM.</description>

      <title>Can Constructions "SCAN" Compositionality ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence to Sequence models struggle at compositionality and systematic generalisation even while they excel at many other tasks. We attribute this limitation to their failure to internalise constructions conventionalised form meaning pairings that license productive recombination. Building on these insights, we introduce an unsupervised procedure for mining pseudo-constructions: variable-slot templates automatically extracted from training data. When applied to the SCAN dataset, our method yields large gains out-of-distribution splits: accuracy rises to 47.8 %on ADD JUMP and to 20.3% on AROUND RIGHT without any architectural changes or additional supervision. The model also attains competitive performance with? 40% of the original training data, demonstrating strong data efAciency. Our findings highlight the promise of construction-aware preprocessing as an alternative to heavy architectural or training-regime interventions.</description>

      <title>OLaPh: Optimal Language Phonemizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonemization, the conversion of text into phonemes, is a key step in text-to-speech. Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency and provide a freely available resource for future research.</description>

      <title>Causal Understanding by LLMs: The Role of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent papers show LLMs achieve near-random accuracy in causal relation classification, raising questions about whether such failures arise from limited pretraining exposure or deeper representational gaps. We investigate this under uncertainty-based evaluation, testing whether pretraining exposure to causal examples improves causal understanding &gt;18K PubMed sentences -- half from The Pile corpus, half post-2024 -- across seven models (Pythia-1.4B/7B/12B, GPT-J-6B, Dolly-7B/12B, Qwen-7B). We analyze model behavior through: (i) causal classification, where the model identifies causal relationships in text, and (ii) verbatim memorization probing, where we assess whether the model prefers previously seen causal statements over their paraphrases. Models perform four-way classification (direct/conditional/correlational/no-relationship) and select between originals and their generated paraphrases. Results show almost identical accuracy on seen/unseen sentences (p &gt; 0.05), no memorization bias (24.8% original selection), and output distribution over the possible options is almost flat, with entropic values near the maximum (1.35/1.39), confirming random guessing. Instruction-tuned models show severe miscalibration (Qwen: &gt; 95% confidence, 32.8% accuracy, ECE=0.49). Conditional relations induce highest entropy (+11% vs. direct). These findings suggest that failures in causal understanding arise from the lack of structured causal representation, rather than insufficient exposure to causal examples during pretraining.</description>

      <title>Integrated Framework for LLM Evaluation with Answer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Less is More: The Effectiveness of Compact Typological Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic feature datasets such as URIEL+ are valuable for modelling cross-lingual relationships, but their high dimensionality and sparsity, especially for low-resource languages, limit the effectiveness of distance metrics. We propose a pipeline to optimize the URIEL+ typological feature space by combining feature selection and imputation, producing compact yet interpretable typological representations. We evaluate these feature subsets on linguistic distance alignment and downstream tasks, demonstrating that reduced-size representations of language typology can yield more informative distance metrics and improve performance in multilingual NLP applications.</description>

      <title>Embedding Domain Knowledge for Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.</description>

      <title>Probing Gender Bias in Multilingual LLMs: A Case Study of Stereotypes in Persian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used worldwide, making it essential to ensure they are free from gender bias to prevent representational harm. While prior studies have examined such biases in high-resource languages, low-resource languages remain understudied. In this paper, we propose a template-based probing methodology, validated against real-world data, to uncover gender stereotypes in LLMs. As part of this framework, we introduce the Domain-Specific Gender Skew Index (DS-GSI), a metric that quantifies deviations from gender parity. We evaluate four prominent models, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Qwen QwQ 32B, across four semantic domains, focusing on Persian, a low-resource language with distinct linguistic features. Our results show that all models exhibit gender stereotypes, with greater disparities in Persian than in English across all domains. Among these, sports reflect the most rigid gender biases. This study underscores the need for inclusive NLP practices and provides a framework for assessing bias in other low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Thinking Augmented Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Play by the Type Rules: Inferring Constraints for LLM Functions in Declarative Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating LLM powered operators in declarative query languages allows for the combination of cheap and interpretable functions with powerful, generalizable language model reasoning. However, in order to benefit from the optimized execution of a database query language like SQL, generated outputs must align with the rules enforced by both type checkers and database contents. Current approaches address this challenge with orchestrations consisting of many LLM-based post-processing calls to ensure alignment between generated outputs and database values, introducing performance bottlenecks. We perform a study on the ability of various sized open-source language models to both parse and execute functions within a query language based on SQL, showing that small language models can excel as function executors over hybrid data sources. Then, we propose an efficient solution to enforce the well-typedness of LLM functions, demonstrating 7% accuracy improvement on a multi-hop question answering dataset with 53% improvement in latency over comparable solutions.

      <title>Low-Resource English-Tigrinya MT: Leveraging Multilingual Models, Custom Tokenizers, and Clean Evaluation Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), low-resource languages like Tigrinya remain underserved due to persistent challenges, including limited corpora, inadequate tokenization strategies, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper investigates transfer learning techniques using multilingual pretrained models to enhance translation quality for morphologically rich, low-resource languages. We propose a refined approach that integrates language-specific tokenization, informed embedding initialization, and domain-adaptive fine-tuning. To enable rigorous assessment, we construct a high-quality, human-aligned English-Tigrinya evaluation dataset covering diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning with a custom tokenizer substantially outperforms zero-shot baselines, with gains validated by BLEU, chrF, and qualitative human evaluation. Bonferroni correction is applied to ensure statistical significance across configurations. Error analysis reveals key limitations and informs targeted refinements. This study underscores the importance of linguistically aware modeling and reproducible benchmarks in bridging the performance gap for underrepresented languages.

      <title>Investigating the Representation of Backchannels and Fillers in Fine-tuned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backchannels and fillers are important linguistic expressions in dialogue, but are under-represented in modern transformer-based language models (LMs). Our work studies the representation of them in language models using three fine-tuning strategies. The models are trained on three dialogue corpora in English and Japanese, where backchannels and fillers are preserved and annotated, to investigate how fine-tuning can help LMs learn their representations. We first apply clustering analysis to the learnt representation of backchannels and fillers, and have found increased silhouette scores in representations from fine-tuned models, which suggests that fine-tuning enables LMs to distinguish the nuanced semantic variation in different backchannel and filler use. We also use natural language generation (NLG) metrics to confirm that the utterances generated by fine-tuned language models resemble human-produced utterances more closely. Our findings suggest the potentials of transforming general LMs into conversational LMs that are more capable of producing human-like languages adequately.</description>

      <title>Instruction Boundary: Quantifying Biases in LLM Reasoning under Various Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) reasoning has long been regarded as a powerful tool for problem solving across domains, providing non-experts with valuable advice. However, their limitations - especially those stemming from prompt design - remain underexplored. Because users may supply biased or incomplete prompts - often unintentionally - LLMs can be misled, undermining reliability and creating risks. We refer to this vulnerability as the Instruction Boundary. To investigate the phenomenon, we distill it into eight concrete facets and introduce BiasDetector, a framework that measures biases arising from three instruction types: complete, redundant, and insufficient. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs and find that, despite high headline accuracy, substantial biases persist in many downstream tasks as a direct consequence of prompt coverage. Our empirical study confirms that LLM reasoning reliability can still be significantly improved. We analyze the practical impact of these biases and outline mitigation strategies. Our findings underscore the need for developers to tackle biases and for users to craft options carefully.</description>

      <title>Feeding Two Birds or Favoring One? Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Hope Speech Detection: A Comparative Study of Logistic Regression, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.</description>

      <title>SIM-CoT: Supervised Implicit Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods present a promising, token-efficient alternative to explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), but a persistent performance gap has limited the application of implicit CoT. We identify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of implicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens to enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and collapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent representations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a failure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT approaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training module that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder during training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit reasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful information. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference, preserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added overhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis. SIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain stability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by +8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B. Demonstrating strong scalability, SIM-CoT also surpasses the explicit CoT baseline on GPT-2 by 2.1% with 2.3\times greater token efficiency, while substantially closing the performance gap on larger models like LLaMA-3.1 8B.</description>

      <title>Z-Scores: A Metric for Linguistically Assessing Disfluency Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating disfluency removal in speech requires more than aggregate token-level scores. Traditional word-based metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 (E-Scores) capture overall performance but cannot reveal why models succeed or fail. We introduce Z-Scores, a span-level linguistically-grounded evaluation metric that categorizes system behavior across distinct disfluency types (EDITED, INTJ, PRN). Our deterministic alignment module enables robust mapping between generated text and disfluent transcripts, allowing Z-Scores to expose systematic weaknesses that word-level metrics obscure. By providing category-specific diagnostics, Z-Scores enable researchers to identify model failure modes and design targeted interventions -- such as tailored prompts or data augmentation -- yielding measurable performance improvements. A case study with LLMs shows that Z-Scores uncover challenges with INTJ and PRN disfluencies hidden in aggregate F1, directly informing model refinement strategies.</description>

      <title>DRES: Benchmarking LLMs for Disfluency Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disfluencies -- such as "um," "uh," interjections, parentheticals, and edited statements -- remain a persistent challenge for speech-driven systems, degrading accuracy in command interpretation, summarization, and conversational agents. We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled text-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for this task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating disfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically evaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies, and architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently improves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented models tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near state-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We further present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical recommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven pipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for advancing robust spoken-language systems.</description>

      <title>Morphological Synthesizer for Ge'ez Language: Addressing Morphological Complexity and Resource Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge'ez is an ancient Semitic language renowned for its unique alphabet. It serves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic, and played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development during the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical language in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity documentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary sources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge, and civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich inflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed and published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data, corpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based Ge'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words according to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample verbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the system. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline model and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system considering morphological variations of the language.

      <title>EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.</description>

      <title>Language Models that Think, Chat Better</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language model reasoning by using rule-based rewards in verifiable domains such as mathematics and code. However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks -- such as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason routinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond verifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking (**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world prompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and optimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in RLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and instruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT consistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial gains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and ArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative writing and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and creative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be applied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training. Remarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT recipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex multi-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and quantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results rethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and employ thinking more broadly.</description>

      <title>STARQA: A Question Answering Dataset for Complex Analytical Reasoning over Structured Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic parsing methods for converting text to SQL queries enable question answering over structured data and can greatly benefit analysts who routinely perform complex analytics on vast data stored in specialized relational databases. Although several benchmarks measure the abilities of text to SQL, the complexity of their questions is inherently limited by the level of expressiveness in query languages and none focus explicitly on questions involving complex analytical reasoning which require operations such as calculations over aggregate analytics, time series analysis or scenario understanding. In this paper, we introduce STARQA, the first public human-created dataset of complex analytical reasoning questions and answers on three specialized-domain databases. In addition to generating SQL directly using LLMs, we evaluate a novel approach (Text2SQLCode) that decomposes the task into a combination of SQL and Python: SQL is responsible for data fetching, and Python more naturally performs reasoning. Our results demonstrate that identifying and combining the abilities of SQL and Python is beneficial compared to using SQL alone, yet the dataset still remains quite challenging for the existing state-of-the-art LLMs.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p &lt; 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.</description>

      <title>Frame-Stacked Local Transformers For Efficient Multi-Codebook Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Language Models with Modality-Specific Experts for Financial Forecasting from Interleaved Sequences of Text and Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets: news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Speech Summarization in Multi-modal LLMs with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech summarization is a critical component of spoken content understanding, particularly in the era of rapidly growing spoken and audiovisual data. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), leveraging the power of LLMs, enable generating textual summaries directly from speech without intermediate transcriptions, while supporting controllable styles and zero-shot generalization. However, open-source MLLMs continue to lag behind the state-of-the-art text-based LLMs, limiting their practical deployment for speech summarization. In this work, we present a novel multi-stage reinforcement learning training framework to enhance the speech summarization capabilities in MLLMs. Our model delivers substantial improvements over strong baselines, outperforms much larger MLLMs, and significantly narrows the gap with state-of-the-art text-based LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Community engagement processes in representative political contexts, like school districts, generate massive volumes of feedback that overwhelm traditional synthesis methods, creating barriers to shared understanding not only between civic leaders and constituents but also among community members. To address these barriers, we developed StoryBuilder, a human-AI collaborative pipeline that transforms community input into accessible first-person narratives. Using 2,480 community responses from an ongoing school rezoning process, we generated 124 composite stories and deployed them through a mobile-friendly StorySharer interface. Our mixed-methods evaluation combined a four-month field deployment, user studies with 21 community members, and a controlled experiment examining how narrative composition affects participant reactions. Field results demonstrate that narratives helped community members relate across diverse perspectives. In the experiment, experience-grounded narratives generated greater respect and trust than opinion-heavy narratives. We contribute a human-AI narrative synthesis system and insights on its varied acceptance and effectiveness in a real-world civic context.</description>

      <title>UserRL: Training Interactive User-Centric Agent via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.</description>

      <title>VCRL: Variance-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.</description>

      <title>PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models. The implementation is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.</description>

      <title>Table Detection with Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion for Reflective Vision-Language-Action Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Federation of Agents: A Semantics-Aware Communication Fabric for Large-Scale Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs): machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance. Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines, with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.</description>

      <title>Muse-it: A Tool for Analyzing Music Discourse on Reddit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music engagement spans diverse interactions with music, from selection and emotional response to its impact on behavior, identity, and social connections. Social media platforms provide spaces where such engagement can be observed in natural, unprompted conversations. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) and big data analytics make it possible to analyze these discussions at scale, extending music research to broader contexts. Reddit, in particular, offers anonymity that encourages diverse participation and yields rich discourse on music in ecological settings. Yet the scale of this data requires tools to extract, process, and analyze it effectively. We present Muse-it, a platform that retrieves comprehensive Reddit data centered on user-defined queries. It aggregates posts from across subreddits, supports topic modeling, temporal trend analysis, and clustering, and enables efficient study of large-scale discourse. Muse-it also identifies music-related hyperlinks (e.g., Spotify), retrieves track-level metadata such as artist, album, release date, genre, popularity, and lyrics, and links these to the discussions. An interactive interface provides dynamic visualizations of the collected data. Muse-it thus offers an accessible way for music researchers to gather and analyze big data, opening new avenues for understanding music engagement as it naturally unfolds online.</description>

      <title>Failure Modes of Maximum Entropy RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.</description>

      <title>Scan-do Attitude: Towards Autonomous CT Protocol Management using a Large Language Model Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests. Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API, and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol management in CT imaging.</description>

      <title>TALEC: Teach Your LLM to Evaluate in Specific Domain with In-house Criteria by Criteria Division and Zero-shot Plus Few-shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text generation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in specific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation criteria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and business security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house criteria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to adjust and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a correlation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks.

      <title>Context-Masked Meta-Prompting for Privacy-Preserving LLM Adaptation in Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains like finance necessitates robust methods for privacy preservation and regulatory compliance. This paper presents an iterative meta-prompting methodology designed to optimise hard prompts without exposing proprietary or confidential context to the LLM. Through a novel regeneration process involving feeder and propagation methods, we demonstrate significant improvements in prompt efficacy. Evaluated on public datasets serving as proxies for financial tasks such as SQuAD for extractive financial Q&amp;A, CNN/DailyMail for news summarisation, and SAMSum for client interaction summarisation, our approach, utilising GPT-3.5 Turbo, achieved a 103.87% improvement in ROUGE-L F1 for question answering. This work highlights a practical, low-cost strategy for adapting LLMs to financial applications while upholding critical privacy and auditability standards, offering a compelling case for its relevance in the evolving landscape of generative AI in finance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Automated Medical Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.</description>

      <title>Evading Toxicity Detection with ASCII-art: A Benchmark of Spatial Attacks on Moderation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of adversarial attacks on toxicity detection models that exploit language models' failure to interpret spatially structured text in the form of ASCII art. To evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks, we propose ToxASCII, a benchmark designed to assess the robustness of toxicity detection systems against visually obfuscated inputs. Our attacks achieve a perfect Attack Success Rate (ASR) across a diverse set of state-of-the-art large language models and dedicated moderation tools, revealing a significant vulnerability in current text-only moderation systems.</description>

      <title>UNComp: Can Matrix Entropy Uncover Sparsity? -- A Compressor Design from an Uncertainty-Aware Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference remains challenging due to their substantial memory and computational demands. While techniques such as Key-Value (KV) cache compression are designed to reduce memory usage, they often neglect the structured sparsity inherent in the relationship between hidden states and their corresponding KV cache. In this work, we explore the role of uncertainty as a potential indicator of sparsity within LLMs. We propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware framework that leverages truncated matrix entropy to identify areas of low information content, thereby revealing sparsity patterns that can be used for adaptive compression. Unlike traditional methods that apply uniform compression, UNComp dynamically adjusts its approach to compression, guided by uncertainty measures that reflect the importance of various model components. Our analysis shows that sparsity patterns, when derived from uncertainty estimates, can be exploited to reveal special long-range dependencies, such as retrieval heads and retrieval layers. This perspective not only enhances our understanding of how compression can be optimized but also provides new insights into the inherent sparsity of LLMs during long-context inference. By focusing on uncertainty to analyze the sparsity pattern in detail, UNComp reduces the KV cache size to 4.74% of the original, achieves a 6% prefill speedup, and improves throughput by 6.4x - not only delivering strong lossless compression performance, but also validating the effectiveness of the underlying theoretical tool. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/UNComp.</description>

      <title>Blind Men and the Elephant: Diverse Perspectives on Gender Stereotypes in Benchmark Datasets</title>

Abstract: Accurately measuring gender stereotypical bias in language models is a complex task with many hidden aspects. Current benchmarks have underestimated this multifaceted challenge and failed to capture the full extent of the problem. This paper examines the inconsistencies between intrinsic stereotype benchmarks. We propose that currently available benchmarks each capture only partial facets of gender stereotypes, and when considered in isolation, they provide just a fragmented view of the broader landscape of bias in language models. Using StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs as case studies, we investigated how data distribution affects benchmark results. By applying a framework from social psychology to balance the data of these benchmarks across various components of gender stereotypes, we demonstrated that even simple balancing techniques can significantly improve the correlation between different measurement approaches. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender stereotyping in language models and point to new directions for developing more refined techniques to detect and reduce bias.</description>

      <title>Understanding Before Reasoning: Enhancing Chain-of-Thought with Iterative Summarization Pre-Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is a dominant paradigm in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance complex reasoning. It guides LLMs to present multi-step reasoning, rather than generating the final answer directly. However, CoT encounters difficulties when key information required for reasoning is implicit or missing. This occurs because CoT emphasizes the sequence of reasoning steps while overlooking the early extraction of essential information. We propose a pre-prompting method called Iterative Summarization Pre-Prompting (ISP^2) to refine LLM reasoning when key information is not explicitly provided. First, entities and their corresponding descriptions are extracted to form potential key information pairs. Next, we use a reliability rating to assess these pairs, then merge the two lowest-ranked pairs into a new entity description. This process is repeated until a unique key information pair is obtained. Finally, that pair, along with the original question, is fed into LLMs to produce the answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.1% improvement compared to existing methods. Unlike traditional prompting, ISP^2 adopts an inductive approach with pre-prompting, offering flexible integration into diverse reasoning frameworks. The code is available at https://github.com/zdhgreat/ISP-2.</description>

      <title>LLMs Reproduce Stereotypes of Sexual and Gender Minorities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large body of research has found substantial gender bias in NLP systems. Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used social psychology model -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from both humans and LLMs. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, showing that they amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely advertised use for LLMs.</description>

      <title>BAP v2: An Enhanced Task Framework for Instruction Following in Minecraft Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing interactive agents that can understand language, perceive their surroundings, and act within the physical world is a long-standing goal of AI research. The Minecraft Collaborative Building Task (MCBT) (Narayan-Chen, Jayannavar, and Hockenmaier 2019), a two-player game in which an Architect (A) instructs a Builder (B) to construct a target structure in a simulated 3D Blocks World environment, offers a rich platform to work towards this goal. In this work, we focus on the Builder Action Prediction (BAP) subtask: predicting B's actions in a multimodal game context (Jayannavar, Narayan-Chen, and Hockenmaier 2020) - a challenging testbed for grounded instruction following, with limited training data. We holistically re-examine this task and introduce BAP v2 to address key challenges in evaluation, training data, and modeling. Specifically, we define an enhanced evaluation benchmark, featuring a cleaner test set and fairer, more insightful metrics that also reveal spatial reasoning as the primary performance bottleneck. To address data scarcity and to teach models basic spatial skills, we generate different types of synthetic MCBT data. We observe that current, LLM-based SOTA models trained on the human BAP dialogues fail on these simpler, synthetic BAP ones, but show that training models on this synthetic data improves their performance across the board. We also introduce a new SOTA model, Llama-CRAFTS, which leverages richer input representations, and achieves an F1 score of 53.0 on the BAP v2 task and strong performance on the synthetic data. While this result marks a notable 6 points improvement over previous work, it also underscores the task's remaining difficulty, establishing BAP v2 as a fertile ground for future research, and providing a useful measure of the spatial capabilities of current text-only LLMs in such embodied tasks.</description>

      <title>LLMs as a synthesis between symbolic and distributed approaches to language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between symbolic and distributed approaches to language and cognition. The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the distributed camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development. In this position paper, I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both distributed/continuous/fuzzy and symbolic/discrete/categorical-like representations and processing; 2) models trained on language make use of this flexibility. In particular, I review recent research in interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed. This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it makes them particularly interesting for the study of language. Is it time for peace?</description>

      <title>Triangulating LLM Progress through Benchmarks, Games, and Cognitive Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine three evaluation paradigms: standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU and BBH), interactive games (e.g., Signalling Games or Taboo), and cognitive tests (e.g., for working memory or theory of mind). First, we investigate which of the former two-benchmarks or games-is most effective at discriminating LLMs of varying quality. Then, inspired by human cognitive assessments, we compile a suite of targeted tests that measure cognitive abilities deemed essential for effective language use, and we investigate their correlation with model performance in benchmarks and games. Our analyses reveal that interactive games are superior to standard benchmarks in discriminating models. Causal and logical reasoning correlate with both static and interactive tests, while differences emerge regarding core executive functions and social/emotional skills, which correlate more with games. We advocate for the development of new interactive benchmarks and targeted cognitive tasks inspired by assessing human abilities but designed specifically for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Bridging Information Gaps with Comprehensive Answers: Improving the Diversity and Informativeness of Follow-Up Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating diverse follow-up questions that uncover missing information remains challenging for conversational agents, particularly when they run on small, locally hosted models. To address this, we develop an information-gap-driven knowledge distillation pipeline in which a teacher LLM generates a comprehensive answer, contrasts it with the initial answer to identify information gaps, and formulates gap-bridging follow-up questions. Using this pipeline, we augment the existing FollowupQG dataset tenfold. We then fine-tune smaller student models on the augmented dataset to distill the teacher's knowledge. Experiments with selected teacher-student model pairs show that fine-tuned students achieve significantly higher informativeness and diversity than variations trained on the original dataset. These findings indicate that our pipeline, which mirrors the human cognitive process of information seeking, provides an efficient distillation channel from state-of-the-art LLMs to smaller models, enabling resource-constrained conversational systems to generate more diverse and informative follow-up questions.</description>

      <title>What are Foundation Models Cooking in the Post-Soviet World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The culture of the Post-Soviet states is complex, shaped by a turbulent history that continues to influence current events. In this study, we investigate the Post-Soviet cultural food knowledge of foundation models by constructing BORSch, a multimodal dataset encompassing 1147 and 823 dishes in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, centered around the Post-Soviet region. We demonstrate that leading models struggle to correctly identify the origins of dishes from Post-Soviet nations in both text-only and multimodal Question Answering (QA), instead over-predicting countries linked to the language the question is asked in. Through analysis of pretraining data, we show that these results can be explained by misleading dish-origin co-occurrences, along with linguistic phenomena such as Russian-Ukrainian code mixing. Finally, to move beyond QA-based assessments, we test models' abilities to produce accurate visual descriptions of dishes. The weak correlation between this task and QA suggests that QA alone may be insufficient as an evaluation of cultural understanding. To foster further research, we will make BORSch publicly available at https://github.com/alavrouk/BORSch.</description>

      <title>MEBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Cross-Document Multi-Entity Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-entity question answering (MEQA) represents significant challenges for large language models (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which frequently struggle to consolidate scattered information across diverse documents. While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.</description>

      <title>HoT: Highlighted Chain of Thought for Referencing Supporting Facts from Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements. A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on. To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query. That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input. Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning. When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct. Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Multilingual Previously Fact-Checked Claim Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". By using general tasks, controlling for model similarity, and evaluating a wide range of open-source models, we show that LLMs cannot introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Subjectivity in Cognitive Appraisal with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the utilization of language models in interdisciplinary, human-centered studies grow, expectations of their capabilities continue to evolve. Beyond excelling at conventional tasks, models are now expected to perform well on user-centric measurements involving confidence and human (dis)agreement-factors that reflect subjective preferences. While modeling subjectivity plays an essential role in cognitive science and has been extensively studied, its investigation at the intersection with NLP remains under-explored. In light of this gap, we explore how language models can quantify subjectivity in cognitive appraisal by conducting comprehensive experiments and analyses with both fine-tuned models and prompt-based large language models (LLMs). Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that personality traits and demographic information are critical for measuring subjectivity, yet existing post-hoc calibration methods often fail to achieve satisfactory performance.

      <title>Aligned Probing: Relating Toxic Behavior and Model Internals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce aligned probing, a novel interpretability framework that aligns the behavior of language models (LMs), based on their outputs, and their internal representations (internals). Using this framework, we examine over 20 OLMo, Llama, and Mistral models, bridging behavioral and internal perspectives for toxicity for the first time. Our results show that LMs strongly encode information about the toxicity level of inputs and subsequent outputs, particularly in lower layers. Focusing on how unique LMs differ offers both correlative and causal evidence that they generate less toxic output when strongly encoding information about the input toxicity. We also highlight the heterogeneity of toxicity, as model behavior and internals vary across unique attributes such as Threat. Finally, four case studies analyzing detoxification, multi-prompt evaluations, model quantization, and pre-training dynamics underline the practical impact of aligned probing with further concrete insights. Our findings contribute to a more holistic understanding of LMs, both within and beyond the context of toxicity.</description>

      <title>Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{CROSS}, a flexible framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. CROSS is designed by decomposing the TTAG modeling process into two phases: (i) temporal semantics extraction; and (ii) semantic-structural information unification. The key idea is to advance the large language models (LLMs) to dynamically extract the temporal semantics in text space and then generate cohesive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the CROSS framework, which empowers LLMs to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that CROSS achieves state-of-the-art results on four public datasets and one industrial dataset, with 24.7% absolute MRR gain on average in temporal link prediction and 3.7% AUC gain in node classification of industrial application.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Reward Scaling for LLM Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alignment is vital for safely deploying large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques are either reward-based (train a reward model on preference pairs and optimize with reinforcement learning) or reward-free (directly fine-tune on ranked outputs). Recent research shows that well-tuned reward-based pipelines remain robust, and single-response demonstrations can outperform pairwise preference data. However, two challenges persist: (1) imbalanced safety datasets that overrepresent common hazards while neglecting long-tail threats; and (2) static reward models that ignore task difficulty, limiting optimization efficiency and attainable gains. We propose DR-IRL (Dynamically adjusting Rewards through Inverse Reinforcement Learning). We first train category-specific reward models using a balanced safety dataset covering seven harmful categories via IRL. Then we enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing dynamic reward scaling--adjusting rewards by task difficulty--data-level hardness by text encoder cosine similarity, model-level responsiveness by reward gaps. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that DR-IRL outperforms all baseline methods in safety alignment while maintaining usefulness.</description>

Abstract: Interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus recently for post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), through the use of reward models that judge the appropriateness of a model's response. In this paper, we investigate whether Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can also serve as a source of feedback signals for learning. We introduce Playpen, an environment for off- and online learning through Dialogue Game self-play, and investigate a representative set of post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning; direct alignment (DPO); and reinforcement learning with GRPO. We experiment with post-training a small LLM (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating performance on unseen instances of training games as well as unseen games, and on standard benchmarks. We find that imitation learning through SFT improves performance on unseen instances, but negatively impacts other skills, while interactive learning with GRPO shows balanced improvements without loss of skills. We release the framework and the baseline training setups to foster research in the promising new direction of learning in (synthetic) interaction.</description>

      <title>Small or Large? Zero-Shot or Finetuned? Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</description>

      <title>Meeseeks: A Feedback-Driven, Iterative Self-Correction Benchmark evaluating LLMs' Instruction Following Capability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21625v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability to precisely adhere to instructions is a cornerstone for Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as dependable agents in real-world scenarios. However, confronted with complex prompts, LLMs frequently encounter difficulties in fulfilling all specified requirements within a single response. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and self-correction methodologies, we introduce Meeseeks (The name is inspired by Mr. Meeseeks from "Rick and Morty," a character renowned for efficiently accomplishing assigned tasks. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks), a fully automated iterative instruction-following benchmark equipped with an integrated feedback mechanism. Meeseeks identifies erroneous components in model responses and provides corresponding feedback accurately, thereby iteratively guiding the model toward self-correction. The dataset contains over 700 curated instances annotated by 32 distinct capability tags in Chinese and English. Extensive experimental results reveal that different state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs exhibit vastly disparate performance, and even after 20 turns of iterative feedback-driven self-correction, nearly all models demonstrate suboptimal performance. We conducted comprehensive analysis from both macro and instance levels, uncovering numerous common issues prevalent in current state-of-the-art models, as well as several counterintuitive phenomena. We've open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/Meeseeks.</description>

      <title>Scent of Knowledge: Optimizing Search-Enhanced Reasoning with Information Foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval has become a standard method to address their inherent knowledge cutoff limitations. However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static, pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.</description>

      <title>SAFE: Improving LLM Systems using Sentence-Level In-generation Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are paramount. To be reliable, attribution systems require high accuracy for short-length attribution on retrieved data, i.e., attribution to a sentence within a document rather than the entire document. We propose SAFE, a Sentence-level A ttribution FramEwork for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that attributes generated sentences during generation. This allows users to verify sentences as they read them and correct the model when the attribution indicates the generated text is not grounded in the documents, increasing the safety of LLM systems. This framework consists of two steps: predicting the required number of references for a sentence, and attributing the sentence. Our approach achieved 95% accuracy in the first step, which translated to 2.1\~6.0% improvements in the accuracy (normalized for maximum possible accuracy) of all attribution algorithms in our clean dataset, when compared to their top-1 accuracy. We also applied SAFE in real-world scenarios with documents containing hundreds to thousands of sentences. In these settings, SAFE reliably attributed sentences to their source documents, demonstrating that the method generalizes beyond controlled benchmarks. The SAFE framework and the training dataset are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>From Unaligned to Aligned: Scaling Multilingual LLMs with Multi-Way Parallel Corpora</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.</description>

      <title>DISCO Balances the Scales: Adaptive Domain- and Difficulty-Aware Reinforcement Learning on Imbalanced Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups, assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Tonyzhou98/disco_grpo.</description>

      <title>Date Fragments: A Hidden Bottleneck of Tokenization for Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments, e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we (1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future time periods; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses, uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$ day). Our datasets and code are made publicly available \href{https://github.com/gagan3012/date-fragments}{here}.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Privacy of Retrieval Data against Membership Inference Attacks: Is This Query Too Close to Home?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates the hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs) and has proven effective for personalized usages. However, delivering private retrieved documents directly to LLMs introduces vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which try to determine whether the target data point exists in the private external database or not. Based on the insight that MIA queries typically exhibit high similarity to only one target document, we introduce a novel similarity-based MIA detection framework designed for the RAG system. With the proposed method, we show that a simple detect-and-hide strategy can successfully obfuscate attackers, maintain data utility, and remain system-agnostic against MIA. We experimentally prove its detection and defense against various state-of-the-art MIA methods and its adaptability to existing RAG systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work shows that post-training datasets for LLMs can be substantially downsampled without noticeably deteriorating performance. However, data selection often incurs high computational costs or is limited to narrow domains. In this paper, we demonstrate that data selection can be both -- efficient and universal -- by using a multi-step pipeline in which we efficiently bin data points into groups, estimate quality using specialized models, and score difficulty with a robust, lightweight method. Task-based categorization allows us to control the composition of our final data -- crucial for finetuning multi-purpose models. To guarantee diversity, we improve upon previous work using embedding models and a clustering algorithm. This integrated strategy enables high-performance fine-tuning with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Advancing Expert Specialization for Better MoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per input. However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components. We will release our code to contribute to the community.</description>

      <title>DyePack: Provably Flagging Test Set Contamination in LLMs Using Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.</description>

      <title>Threading the Needle: Reweaving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Explain Human Label Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>LegalSearchLM: Rethinking Legal Case Retrieval as Legal Elements Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case, is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making. However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering 411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M candidate cases; and (2) LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the query case and directly generates content containing those elements, grounded in the target cases through constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.</description>

      <title>RadialRouter: Structured Representation for Efficient and Robust Large Language Models Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.</description>

      <title>How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful Thoughts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness. Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection, showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Multi-Agent Communication with State Delta Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing multi-agent systems constructed from a single base LLM mostly use natural language for agent communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability, it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample its continuous state vectors to discrete tokens before transferring them to the other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process. We propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols, particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Medium Is Not the Message: Deconfounding Document Embeddings via Linear Concept Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the embeddings are not otherwise degraded.</description>

      <title>Detecting Token-Level Hallucinations Using Variance Signals: A Reference-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</description>

      <title>VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual Grounding Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Parameter Memory: Temporary LoRA-Enhanced LLM for Long-Sequence Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Embeddings via Prompt Engineering and Contrastive Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However, pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information. Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and (iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these components yields competitive performance on the English clustering track of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically generated positive pairs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>From Query to Logic: Ontology-Driven Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>SciRerankBench: Benchmarking Rerankers Towards Scientific Retrieval-Augmented Generated LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.</description>

      <title>Culture is Everywhere: A Call for Intentionally Cultural Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings. In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks. We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.</description>

      <title>Expanding the WMT24++ Benchmark with Rumantsch Grischun, Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader</title>

Abstract: The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.</description>

Abstract: AI music generation is rapidly emerging in the creative industries, enabling intuitive music generation from textual descriptions. However, these systems pose risks in exploitation of copyrighted creations, raising ethical and legal concerns. In this paper, we present preliminary results on the first application of machine unlearning techniques from an ongoing research to prevent inadvertent usage of creative content. Particularly, we explore existing methods in machine unlearning to a pre-trained Text-to-Music (TTM) baseline and analyze their efficacy in unlearning pre-trained datasets without harming model performance. Through our experiments, we provide insights into the challenges of applying unlearning in music generation, offering a foundational analysis for future works on the application of unlearning for music generative models.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Research in Conversation: A Case Study in Computational Morphology for Language Documentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces richer, more relevant research directions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM) pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter model on up to 1T tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition baseline and delivers a significant fraction of performance improvement attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data. Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance, SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces three self-contained data augmentation methods for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our techniques first generate novel text--using gloss-based replacement, random replacement, or an LLM-based approach--and then apply Text-to-Speech (TTS) to produce synthetic audio. We apply these methods, which leverage only the original annotated data, to four languages with extremely limited resources (Vatlongos, Nashta, Shinekhen Buryat, and Kakabe). Fine-tuning a pretrained Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model on a combination of the original audio and generated synthetic data yields significant performance gains, including a 14.3% absolute WER reduction for Nashta. The methods prove effective across all four low-resource languages and also show utility for high-resource languages like English, demonstrating their broad applicability.</description>

Abstract: Recent speech-LLMs have shown impressive performance in tasks like transcription and translation, yet they remain limited in understanding the paralinguistic aspects of speech crucial for social and emotional intelligence. We propose CP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating speech-LLMs on contextual paralinguistic reasoning the integration of verbal content with non-verbal cues like emotion and prosody. The benchmark includes two curated question answering (QA) datasets requiring both linguistic and empathetic understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art speech-LLMs from both open and closed-source models and perform a comprehensive analysis across different question types. The top two models were further analyzed under temperature tuning to understand its effect on this task. Our benchmark reveals a key gap in existing evaluations and offers insights into building more context-aware and emotionally intelligent speech-capable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason Over Non-Text Modalities in a Training-Free Manner? A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep learning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality representations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised training, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In this work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from non-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free manner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a proof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality representations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning, which incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM representations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without fine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain, investigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations into LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL performance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To the best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for integrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting a promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization.</description>

      <title>When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.</description>

      <title>MAPEX: A Multi-Agent Pipeline for Keyphrase Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing. However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting, regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities, especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44% and standard LLM baselines by 4.01% in F1@5 on average.

      <title>Charting a Decade of Computational Linguistics in Italy: The CLiC-it Corpus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to 2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting informed decisions and future directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Soft Tokens, Hard Truths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.</description>

      <title>Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity as reading and summarization aids. However, little is known about their potential benefits when integrated with mixed reality (MR) interfaces to support everyday reading. In this iterative investigation, we developed RealitySummary, an MR reading assistant that seamlessly integrates LLMs with always-on camera access, OCR-based text extraction, and augmented spatial and visual responses. Developed iteratively, RealitySummary evolved across three versions, each shaped by user feedback and reflective analysis: 1) a preliminary user study to understand reader perceptions (N=12), 2) an in-the-wild deployment to explore real-world usage (N=11), and 3) a diary study to capture insights from real-world work contexts (N=5). Our empirical studies' findings highlight the unique advantages of combining AI and MR, including always-on implicit assistance, long-term temporal history, minimal context switching, and spatial affordances, demonstrating significant potential for future LLM-MR interfaces beyond traditional screen-based interactions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work.

      <title>Unifying Symbolic Music Arrangement: Track-Aware Reconstruction and Structured Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for automatic multitrack music arrangement that enables a single pre-trained symbolic music model to handle diverse arrangement scenarios, including reinterpretation, simplification, and additive generation. At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</description>

      <title>Robust Training of Neural Networks at Arbitrary Precision and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.</description>

      <title>A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment to answer a situated question with confidence. This problem remains challenging in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient planning and exploration. To address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantics-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps. We further demonstrate GraphEQA in multiple real-world home and office environments.</description>

      <title>HawkBench: Investigating Resilience of RAG Methods on Stratified Information-Seeking Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world information-seeking scenarios, users have dynamic and diverse needs, requiring RAG systems to demonstrate adaptable resilience. To comprehensively evaluate the resilience of current RAG methods, we introduce HawkBench, a human-labeled, multi-domain benchmark designed to rigorously assess RAG performance across categorized task types. By stratifying tasks based on information-seeking behaviors, HawkBench provides a systematic evaluation of how well RAG systems adapt to diverse user needs.
  Unlike existing benchmarks, which focus primarily on specific task types (mostly factoid queries) and rely on varying knowledge bases, HawkBench offers: (1) systematic task stratification to cover a broad range of query types, including both factoid and rationale queries, (2) integration of multi-domain corpora across all task types to mitigate corpus bias, and (3) rigorous annotation for high-quality evaluation.
  HawkBench includes 1,600 high-quality test samples, evenly distributed across domains and task types. Using this benchmark, we evaluate representative RAG methods, analyzing their performance in terms of answer quality and response latency. Our findings highlight the need for dynamic task strategies that integrate decision-making, query interpretation, and global knowledge understanding to improve RAG generalizability. We believe HawkBench serves as a pivotal benchmark for advancing the resilience of RAG methods and their ability to achieve general-purpose information seeking.</description>

      <title>CNS-Obsidian: A Neurosurgical Vision-Language Model Built From Scientific Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, but their opaque training on uncurated internet data posse critical limitations for high-stakes decision-making, such as in neurosurgery. We present CNS-Obsidian, a neurosurgical VLM trained on peer-reviewed neurosurgical literature, and demonstrate its clinical utility compared with GPT-4o in a real-world setting. We compiled 23,984 articles from Neurosurgery Publications journals, yielding 78,853 figures and captions. Using GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet-3.5, we converted these image-text pairs into 263,064 training samples across three formats: instruction fine-tuning, multiple-choice questions, and differential diagnosis. We trained CNS-Obsidian, a fine-tune of the 34-billion parameter LLaVA-Next model. In a blinded, randomized deployment trial at NYU Langone Health (Aug 30-Nov 30, 2024), neurosurgeons were assigned to use either CNS-Obsidian or GPT-4o as a diagnostic co-pilot after patient consultations. Primary outcomes were diagnostic helpfulness and accuracy. CNS-Obsidian matched GPT-4o on synthetic questions (76.13% vs 77.54%, p=0.235), but only achieved 46.81% accuracy on human-generated questions versus GPT-4o's 65.70% (p&lt;10-15). In the randomized trial, 70 consultations were evaluated (32 CNS-Obsidian, 38 GPT-4o) from 959 total consults. CNS-Obsidian received positive ratings in 40.62% of cases versus 57.89% for GPT-4o (p=0.230). Both models included correct diagnosis in approximately 60% of cases (59.38% vs 65.79%, p=0.626). Domain-specific VLMs trained on curated scientific literature can approach frontier model performance in specialized medical domains despite being orders of magnitude smaller and less expensive to train. However, low clinical utilization suggests chatbot interfaces may not align with specialist workflows, indicating need for alternative AI integration strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Outlining: Heterogeneous Recursive Planning for Adaptive Long-form Writing with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predefined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose WriteHERE, a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types: retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework. We have publicly released our code and prompts to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Towards Visual Text Grounding of Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the existing evolution of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a non-neglectable limitation remains in their struggle with visual text grounding, especially in text-rich images of documents. Document images, such as scanned forms and infographics, highlight critical challenges due to their complex layouts and textual content. However, current benchmarks do not fully address these challenges, as they mostly focus on visual grounding on natural images, rather than text-rich document images. Thus, to bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG, a novel task with a newly designed instruction dataset for benchmarking and improving the Text-Rich Image Grounding capabilities of MLLMs in document question-answering. Specifically, we propose an OCR-LLM-human interaction pipeline to create 800 manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set of 90$ synthetic data based on four diverse datasets. A comprehensive evaluation of various MLLMs on our proposed benchmark exposes substantial limitations in their grounding capability on text-rich images. In addition, we propose two simple and effective TRIG methods based on general instruction tuning and plug-and-play efficient embedding, respectively. By finetuning MLLMs on our synthetic dataset, they promisingly improve spatial reasoning and grounding capabilities.</description>

      <title>Stepwise Guided Policy Optimization: Coloring your Incorrect Reasoning in GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.</description>

      <title>AAPO: Enhancing the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs with Advantage Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods, group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of AAPO.</description>

      <title>Redemption Score: A Multi-Modal Evaluation Framework for Image Captioning via Distributional, Perceptual, and Linguistic Signal Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most metrics. We introduce Redemption Score(RS), a novel hybrid framework that ranks image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment, (2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual grounding, and (3) LLM Text Embeddings for contextual text similarity against human references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows RS to offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, RS achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 58.42, outperforming most prior methods and demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced evaluation by thoroughly examining both the visual accuracy and text quality together, with consistent performance across Conceptual Captions and MS COCO.</description>

      <title>WikiGap: Promoting Epistemic Equity by Surfacing Knowledge Gaps Between English Wikipedia and other Language Editions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next largest edition, English Wikipedia dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions, leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English. Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface. Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia. WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language editions.</description>

      <title>Localized LoRA: A Structured Low-Rank Approximation for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.</description>

      <title>OmniSpatial: Towards Comprehensive Spatial Reasoning Benchmark for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks cover only the most elementary layer of spatial reasoning and are largely approaching saturation in the latest reasoning models. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through careful manual annotation, we construct over 8.4K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial reasoning. We also explore two strategies-PointGraph (explicit scene graph cues) and SpatialCoT (novel-view chain-of-thought)-to bolster spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>Urania: Differentially Private Insights into AI Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection. Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively balancing data utility with privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC@1000 by 54% over existing models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.</description>

      <title>Patterns in the Transition From Founder-Leadership to Community Governance of Open Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions GOVERNANCE.md. With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.</description>

      <title>DRES: Fake news detection by dynamic representation and ensemble selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of information via social media has made text-based fake news detection critically important due to its societal impact. This paper presents a novel detection method called Dynamic Representation and Ensemble Selection (DRES) for identifying fake news based solely on text. DRES leverages instance hardness measures to estimate the classification difficulty for each news article across multiple textual feature representations. By dynamically selecting the textual representation and the most competent ensemble of classifiers for each instance, DRES significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRES achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of representation selection based on instance hardness and dynamic ensemble selection in boosting performance.

      <title>CogAtom: From Cognitive Atoms to Olympiad-level Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its demand for multi-step reasoning and abstract conceptual integration. While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units, cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems; meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity, generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.</description>

      <title>Safe-SAIL: Towards a Fine-grained Safety Landscape of Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoder Interpretation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to address broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related concepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regulations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we propose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron explanations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Citrus-V: Advancing Medical Foundation Models with Unified Medical Image Grounding for Clinical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.</description>
