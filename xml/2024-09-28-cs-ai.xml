      <title>Collaborative Comic Generation: Integrating Visual Narrative Theories with AI Models for Enhanced Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a theory-inspired visual narrative generative system that integrates conceptual principles-comic authoring idioms-with generative and language models to enhance the comic creation process. Our system combines human creativity with AI models to support parts of the generative process, providing a collaborative platform for creating comic content. These comic-authoring idioms, derived from prior human-created image sequences, serve as guidelines for crafting and refining storytelling. The system translates these principles into system layers that facilitate comic creation through sequential decision-making, addressing narrative elements such as panel composition, story tension changes, and panel transitions. Key contributions include integrating machine learning models into the human-AI cooperative comic generation process, deploying abstract narrative theories into AI-driven comic creation, and a customizable tool for narrative-driven image sequences. This approach improves narrative elements in generated image sequences and engages human creativity in an AI-generative process of comics.

      <title>AAPM: Large Language Model Agent-based Asset Pricing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel asset pricing approach, LLM Agent-based Asset Pricing Models (AAPM), which fuses qualitative discretionary investment analysis from LLM agents and quantitative manual financial economic factors to predict excess asset returns. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms machine learning-based asset pricing baselines in portfolio optimization and asset pricing errors. Specifically, the Sharpe ratio and average $|\alpha|$ for anomaly portfolios improved significantly by 9.6\% and 10.8\% respectively. In addition, we conducted extensive ablation studies on our model and analysis of the data to reveal further insights into the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Proof of Thought : Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis allows Robust and Interpretable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical AI-Based Detection Strategy for Generative Adversarial Network-Based Deepfake Attacks on an Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Sign Classification System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perception module in autonomous vehicles (AVs) relies heavily on deep learning-based models to detect and identify various objects in their surrounding environment. An AV traffic sign classification system is integral to this module, which helps AVs recognize roadway traffic signs. However, adversarial attacks, in which an attacker modifies or alters the image captured for traffic sign recognition, could lead an AV to misrecognize the traffic signs and cause hazardous consequences. Deepfake presents itself as a promising technology to be used for such adversarial attacks, in which a deepfake traffic sign would replace a real-world traffic sign image before the image is fed to the AV traffic sign classification system. In this study, the authors present how a generative adversarial network-based deepfake attack can be crafted to fool the AV traffic sign classification systems. The authors developed a deepfake traffic sign image detection strategy leveraging hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (NNs). This hybrid approach utilizes amplitude encoding to represent the features of an input traffic sign image using quantum states, which substantially reduces the memory requirement compared to its classical counterparts. The authors evaluated this hybrid deepfake detection approach along with several baseline classical convolutional NNs on real-world and deepfake traffic sign images. The results indicate that the hybrid quantum-classical NNs for deepfake detection could achieve similar or higher performance than the baseline classical convolutional NNs in most cases while requiring less than one-third of the memory required by the shallowest classical convolutional NN considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Search for Efficient Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have long held sway in the realms of artificial intelligence research. Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning, quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy in LLMs. However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures. Besides, traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs. In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration. Furthermore, after generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify the inherited weights with a small amount of calibration data. Compared with SOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks, our method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks. Furthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory and achieve inference acceleration.</description>

      <title>AI Enabled Neutron Flux Measurement and Virtual Calibration in Boiling Water Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the three dimensional power distribution within a reactor core is vital for ensuring the safe and economical operation of the reactor, compliance with Technical Specifications, and fuel cycle planning (safety, control, and performance evaluation). Offline (that is, during cycle planning and core design), a three dimensional neutronics simulator is used to estimate the reactor's power, moderator, void, and flow distributions, from which margin to thermal limits and fuel exposures can be approximated. Online, this is accomplished with a system of local power range monitors (LPRMs) designed to capture enough neutron flux information to infer the full nodal power distribution. Certain problems with this process, ranging from measurement and calibration to the power adaption process, pose challenges to operators and limit the ability to design reload cores economically (e.g., engineering in insufficient margin or more margin than required). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used to solve the problems to reduce maintenance costs, improve the accuracy of online local power measurements, and decrease the bias between offline and online power distributions, thereby leading to a greater ability to design safe and economical reload cores. We present ML models trained from two deep neural network (DNN) architectures, SurrogateNet and LPRMNet, that demonstrate a testing error of 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Applications of these models can include virtual sensing capability for bypassed or malfunctioning LPRMs, on demand virtual calibration of detectors between successive calibrations, highly accurate nuclear end of life determinations for LPRMs, and reduced bias between measured and predicted power distributions within the core.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Reward Calibration: A Case Study on Length Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large Language Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is the reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals for optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting spurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based on length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect output rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of undesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of correcting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the concept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach to estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying true reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with the Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we validate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings, demonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain across 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of RM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the AlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF process in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally efficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable and robust solution for mitigating biases in LLM alignment.

      <title>Exploring Semantic Clustering in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic clustering properties of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video games, enriching our understanding of the internal dynamics of DRL and advancing its interpretability. In this context, semantic clustering refers to the inherent capacity of neural networks to internally group video inputs based on semantic similarity. To achieve this, we propose a novel DRL architecture that integrates a semantic clustering module featuring both feature dimensionality reduction and online clustering. This module seamlessly integrates into the DRL training pipeline, addressing instability issues observed in previous t-SNE-based analysis methods and eliminating the necessity for extensive manual annotation of semantic analysis. Through experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed module and the semantic clustering properties in DRL for video games. Additionally, based on these properties, we introduce new analytical methods to help understand the hierarchical structure of policies and the semantic distribution within the feature space.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of ChatGPT for a Systematic Literature Review: a Design-Based Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been used in several educational contexts,including learning, teaching and research. It also has potential to conduct the systematic literature review (SLR). However, there are limited empirical studies on how to use ChatGPT in conducting a SLR. Based on a SLR published,this study used ChatGPT to conduct a SLR of the same 33 papers in a design-based approach, to see what the differences are by comparing the reviews' results,and to answer: To what extent can ChatGPT conduct SLR? What strategies can human researchers utilize to structure prompts for ChatGPT that enhance the reliability and validity of a SLR? This study found that ChatGPT could conduct a SLR. It needs detailed and accurate prompts to analyze the literature. It also has limitations. Guiding principles are summarized from this study for researchers to follow when they need to conduct SLRs using ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>A Time Series is Worth Five Experts: Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Traffic Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction faces significant challenges, necessitating a deep understanding of both temporal and spatial cues and their complex interactions across multiple variables. Recent advancements in traffic prediction systems are primarily due to the development of complex sequence-centric models. However, existing approaches often embed multiple variables and spatial relationships at each time step, which may hinder effective variable-centric learning, ultimately leading to performance degradation in traditional traffic prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce variable-centric and prior knowledge-centric modeling techniques. Specifically, we propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (TITAN) model for traffic flow prediction. TITAN initially consists of three experts focused on sequence-centric modeling. Then, designed a low-rank adaptive method, TITAN simultaneously enables variable-centric modeling. Furthermore, we supervise the gating process using a prior knowledge-centric modeling strategy to ensure accurate routing. Experiments on two public traffic network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate that TITAN effectively captures variable-centric dependencies while ensuring accurate routing. Consequently, it achieves improvements in all evaluation metrics, ranging from approximately 4.37\% to 11.53\%, compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The code is open at \href{https://github.com/sqlcow/TITAN}{https://github.com/sqlcow/TITAN}.</description>

      <title>What Would Happen Next? Predicting Consequences from An Event Causality Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing script event prediction task forcasts the subsequent event based on an event script chain. However, the evolution of historical events are more complicated in real world scenarios and the limited information provided by the event script chain also make it difficult to accurately predict subsequent events. This paper introduces a Causality Graph Event Prediction(CGEP) task that forecasting consequential event based on an Event Causality Graph (ECG). We propose a Semantic Enhanced Distance-sensitive Graph Prompt Learning (SeDGPL) Model for the CGEP task. In SeDGPL, (1) we design a Distance-sensitive Graph Linearization (DsGL) module to reformulate the ECG into a graph prompt template as the input of a PLM; (2) propose an Event-Enriched Causality Encoding (EeCE) module to integrate both event contextual semantic and graph schema information; (3) propose a Semantic Contrast Event Prediction (ScEP) module to enhance the event representation among numerous candidate events and predict consequential event following prompt learning paradigm. %We construct two CGEP datasets based on existing MAVEN-ERE and ESC corpus for experiments. Experiment results validate our argument our proposed SeDGPL model outperforms the advanced competitors for the CGEP task.</description>

      <title>MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their massive parameter counts, which typically result in significant redundancy. This work introduces MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or ``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2) Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL solely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's learnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4 sparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

      <title>Global-Local Medical SAM Adaptor Based on Full Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging of visual language models, such as the segment anything model (SAM), have made great breakthroughs in the field of universal semantic segmentation and significantly aid the improvements of medical image segmentation, in particular with the help of Medical SAM adaptor (Med-SA). However, Med-SA still can be improved, as it fine-tunes SAM in a partial adaption manner. To resolve this problem, we present a novel global medical SAM adaptor (GMed-SA) with full adaption, which can adapt SAM globally. We further combine GMed-SA and Med-SA to propose a global-local medical SAM adaptor (GLMed-SA) to adapt SAM both globally and locally. Extensive experiments have been performed on the challenging public 2D melanoma segmentation dataset. The results show that GLMed-SA outperforms several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on various evaluation metrics, demonstrating the superiority of our methods.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility Modeling with Limited Information via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility patterns has traditionally been a complex challenge in transportation modeling. Due to the difficulties in obtaining high-quality training datasets across diverse locations, conventional activity-based models and learning-based human mobility modeling algorithms are particularly limited by the availability and quality of datasets. Furthermore, current research mainly focuses on the spatial-temporal travel pattern but lacks an understanding of the semantic information between activities, which is crucial for modeling the interdependence between activities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) empowered human mobility modeling framework. Our proposed approach significantly reduces the reliance on detailed human mobility statistical data, utilizing basic socio-demographic information of individuals to generate their daily mobility patterns. We have validated our results using the NHTS and SCAG-ABM datasets, demonstrating the effective modeling of mobility patterns and the strong adaptability of our framework across various geographic locations.</description>

      <title>GLinSAT: The General Linear Satisfiability Neural Network Layer By Accelerated Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers.</description>

      <title>From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance time series forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates various social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations for enriched insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning and reflection to evaluate predictions. This enables our model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By compiling selected news with time series data, we fine-tune the LLaMa2 pre-trained model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and suggest a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting by effectively harnessing unstructured news data.</description>

      <title>Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</description>

      <title>Just say what you want: only-prompting self-rewarding online preference optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with a focus on self-rewarding alignment methods. In online RLHF, obtaining feedback requires interaction with the environment, which can be costly when using additional reward models or the GPT-4 API. Current self-rewarding approaches rely heavily on the discriminator's judgment capabilities, which are effective for large-scale models but challenging to transfer to smaller ones. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, only-prompting self-rewarding online algorithm that generates preference datasets without relying on judgment capabilities. Additionally, we employ fine-grained arithmetic control over the optimality gap between positive and negative examples, generating more hard negatives in the later stages of training to help the model better capture subtle human preferences. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two base models, Mistral-7B and Mistral-Instruct-7B, which significantly bootstrap the performance of the reference model, achieving 34.5% in the Length-controlled Win Rates of AlpacaEval 2.0.</description>

      <title>Showing Many Labels in Multi-label Classification Models: An Empirical Study of Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they have been applied in numerous fields. However, research indicates that DNNs are susceptible to adversarial examples, and this is equally true in the multi-label domain. To further investigate multi-label adversarial examples, we introduce a novel type of attacks, termed "Showing Many Labels". The objective of this attack is to maximize the number of labels included in the classifier's prediction results. In our experiments, we select nine attack algorithms and evaluate their performance under "Showing Many Labels". Eight of the attack algorithms were adapted from the multi-class environment to the multi-label environment, while the remaining one was specifically designed for the multi-label environment. We choose ML-LIW and ML-GCN as target models and train them on four popular multi-label datasets: VOC2007, VOC2012, NUS-WIDE, and COCO. We record the success rate of each algorithm when it shows the expected number of labels in eight different scenarios. Experimental results indicate that under the "Showing Many Labels", iterative attacks perform significantly better than one-step attacks. Moreover, it is possible to show all labels in the dataset.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Data-Driven Framework for Systematic Analysis of SEC 10-K Filings Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of companies listed on the NYSE has been growing exponentially, creating a significant challenge for market analysts, traders, and stockholders who must monitor and assess the performance and strategic shifts of a large number of companies regularly. There is an increasing need for a fast, cost-effective, and comprehensive method to evaluate the performance and detect and compare many companies' strategy changes efficiently. We propose a novel data-driven approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically analyze and rate the performance of companies based on their SEC 10-K filings. These filings, which provide detailed annual reports on a company's financial performance and strategic direction, serve as a rich source of data for evaluating various aspects of corporate health, including confidence, environmental sustainability, innovation, and workforce management. We also introduce an automated system for extracting and preprocessing 10-K filings. This system accurately identifies and segments the required sections as outlined by the SEC, while also isolating key textual content that contains critical information about the company. This curated data is then fed into Cohere's Command-R+ LLM to generate quantitative ratings across various performance metrics. These ratings are subsequently processed and visualized to provide actionable insights. The proposed scheme is then implemented on an interactive GUI as a no-code solution for running the data pipeline and creating the visualizations. The application showcases the rating results and provides year-on-year comparisons of company performance.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Based Coarse-to-Fine Example Selection For Open-Set Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) has achieved great success by selecting the most valuable examples from unlabeled data. However, they usually deteriorate in real scenarios where open-set noise gets involved, which is studied as open-set annotation (OSA). In this paper, we owe the deterioration to the unreliable predictions arising from softmax-based translation invariance and propose a Dirichlet-based Coarse-to-Fine Example Selection (DCFS) strategy accordingly. Our method introduces simplex-based evidential deep learning (EDL) to break translation invariance and distinguish known and unknown classes by considering evidence-based data and distribution uncertainty simultaneously. Furthermore, hard known-class examples are identified by model discrepancy generated from two classifier heads, where we amplify and alleviate the model discrepancy respectively for unknown and known classes. Finally, we combine the discrepancy with uncertainties to form a two-stage strategy, selecting the most informative examples from known classes. Extensive experiments on various openness ratio datasets demonstrate that DCFS achieves state-of-art performance.</description>

      <title>AI Delegates with a Dual Focus: Ensuring Privacy and Strategic Self-Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based AI delegates are increasingly utilized to act on behalf of users, assisting them with a wide range of tasks through conversational interfaces. Despite their advantages, concerns arise regarding the potential risk of privacy leaks, particularly in scenarios involving social interactions. While existing research has focused on protecting privacy by limiting the access of AI delegates to sensitive user information, many social scenarios require disclosing private details to achieve desired outcomes, necessitating a balance between privacy protection and disclosure. To address this challenge, we conduct a pilot study to investigate user preferences for AI delegates across various social relations and task scenarios, and then propose a novel AI delegate system that enables privacy-conscious self-disclosure. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed AI delegate strategically protects privacy, pioneering its use in diverse and dynamic social interactions.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Ecosystem for Oncology Clinical Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise in revolutionizing healthcare, especially in clinical applications. Simultaneously, Digital Twin technology, which models and simulates complex systems, has gained traction in enhancing patient care. However, despite the advances in experimental clinical settings, the potential of AI and digital twins to streamline clinical operations remains largely untapped. This paper introduces a novel digital twin framework specifically designed to enhance oncology clinical operations. We propose the integration of multiple specialized digital twins, such as the Medical Necessity Twin, Care Navigator Twin, and Clinical History Twin, to enhance workflow efficiency and personalize care for each patient based on their unique data. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple data sources and aligning them with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, we create a dynamic Cancer Care Path, a continuously evolving knowledge base that enables these digital twins to provide precise, tailored clinical recommendations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating simulations to train intelligent agents in game-playing and robotics from natural language input, from user input or task documentation, remains an open-ended challenge. Existing approaches focus on parts of this challenge, such as generating reward functions or task hyperparameters. Unlike previous work, we introduce FACTORSIM that generates full simulations in code from language input that can be used to train agents. Exploiting the structural modularity specific to coded simulations, we propose to use a factored partially observable Markov decision process representation that allows us to reduce context dependence during each step of the generation. For evaluation, we introduce a generative simulation benchmark that assesses the generated simulation code's accuracy and effectiveness in facilitating zero-shot transfers in reinforcement learning settings. We show that FACTORSIM outperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding prompt alignment (e.g., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical End-to-End Autonomous Driving: Integrating BEV Perception with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving offers a streamlined alternative to the traditional modular pipeline, integrating perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently gained traction in this domain, existing approaches often overlook the critical connection between feature extraction of DRL and perception. In this paper, we bridge this gap by mapping the DRL feature extraction network directly to the perception phase, enabling clearer interpretation through semantic segmentation. By leveraging Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations, we propose a novel DRL-based end-to-end driving framework that utilizes multi-sensor inputs to construct a unified three-dimensional understanding of the environment. This BEV-based system extracts and translates critical environmental features into high-level abstract states for DRL, facilitating more informed control. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach not only enhances interpretability but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in autonomous driving control tasks, reducing the collision rate by 20%.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy-based Approach to Predict Human Interaction by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.</description>

      <title>Explanation Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent concept-based interpretable models have succeeded in providing meaningful explanations by pre-defined concept sets. However, the dependency on the pre-defined concepts restricts the application because of the limited number of concepts for explanations. This paper proposes a novel interpretable deep neural network called explanation bottleneck models (XBMs). XBMs generate a text explanation from the input without pre-defined concepts and then predict a final task prediction based on the generated explanation by leveraging pre-trained vision-language encoder-decoder models. To achieve both the target task performance and the explanation quality, we train XBMs through the target task loss with the regularization penalizing the explanation decoder via the distillation from the frozen pre-trained decoder. Our experiments, including a comparison to state-of-the-art concept bottleneck models, confirm that XBMs provide accurate and fluent natural language explanations without pre-defined concept sets.

      <title>Artificial Data Point Generation in Clustered Latent Space for Small Medical Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the growing trends in machine learning is the use of data generation techniques, since the performance of machine learning models is dependent on the quantity of the training dataset. However, in many medical applications, collecting large datasets is challenging due to resource constraints, which leads to overfitting and poor generalization. This paper introduces a novel method, Artificial Data Point Generation in Clustered Latent Space (AGCL), designed to enhance classification performance on small medical datasets through synthetic data generation. The AGCL framework involves feature extraction, K-means clustering, cluster evaluation based on a class separation metric, and the generation of synthetic data points from clusters with distinct class representations. This method was applied to Parkinson's disease screening, utilizing facial expression data, and evaluated across multiple machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that AGCL significantly improves classification accuracy compared to baseline, GN and kNNMTD. AGCL achieved the highest overall test accuracy of 83.33% and cross-validation accuracy of 90.90% in majority voting over different emotions, confirming its effectiveness in augmenting small datasets.</description>

      <title>The application of GPT-4 in grading design university students' assignment and providing feedback: An exploratory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate whether GPT-4 can effectively grade assignments for design university students and provide useful feedback. In design education, assignments do not have a single correct answer and often involve solving an open-ended design problem. This subjective nature of design projects often leads to grading problems,as grades can vary between different raters,for instance instructor from engineering background or architecture background. This study employs an iterative research approach in developing a Custom GPT with the aim of achieving more reliable results and testing whether it can provide design students with constructive feedback. The findings include: First,through several rounds of iterations the inter-reliability between GPT and human raters reached a level that is generally accepted by educators. This indicates that by providing accurate prompts to GPT,and continuously iterating to build a Custom GPT, it can be used to effectively grade students' design assignments, serving as a reliable complement to human raters. Second, the intra-reliability of GPT's scoring at different times is between 0.65 and 0.78. This indicates that, with adequate instructions, a Custom GPT gives consistent results which is a precondition for grading students. As consistency and comparability are the two main rules to ensure the reliability of educational assessment, this study has looked at whether a Custom GPT can be developed that adheres to these two rules. We finish the paper by testing whether Custom GPT can provide students with useful feedback and reflecting on how educators can develop and iterate a Custom GPT to serve as a complementary rater.</description>

      <title>Ophthalmic Biomarker Detection with Parallel Prediction of Transformer and Convolutional Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ophthalmic diseases represent a significant global health issue, necessitating the use of advanced precise diagnostic tools. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imagery which offers high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina has become a pivotal imaging modality in ophthalmology. Traditionally physicians have manually detected various diseases and biomarkers from such diagnostic imagery. In recent times, deep learning techniques have been extensively used for medical diagnostic tasks enabling fast and precise diagnosis. This paper presents a novel approach for ophthalmic biomarker detection using an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer. While CNNs are good for feature extraction within the local context of the image, transformers are known for their ability to extract features from the global context of the image. Using an ensemble of both techniques allows us to harness the best of both worlds. Our method has been implemented on the OLIVES dataset to detect 6 major biomarkers from the OCT images and shows significant improvement of the macro averaged F1 score on the dataset.</description>

      <title>DREAMS: A python framework to train deep learning models with model card reporting for medical and health applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data provides a non-invasive method for researchers and clinicians to observe brain activity in real time. The integration of deep learning techniques with EEG data has significantly improved the ability to identify meaningful patterns, leading to valuable insights for both clinical and research purposes. However, most of the frameworks so far, designed for EEG data analysis, are either too focused on pre-processing or in deep learning methods per, making their use for both clinician and developer communities problematic. Moreover, critical issues such as ethical considerations, biases, uncertainties, and the limitations inherent in AI models for EEG data analysis are frequently overlooked, posing challenges to the responsible implementation of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive deep learning framework tailored for EEG data processing, model training and report generation. While constructed in way to be adapted and developed further by AI developers, it enables to report, through model cards, the outcome and specific information of use for both developers and clinicians. In this way, we discuss how this framework can, in the future, provide clinical researchers and developers with the tools needed to create transparent and accountable AI models for EEG data analysis and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Measuring Confounding Using Causal Mechanism Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and measuring confounding effects from data is a key challenge in causal inference. Existing methods frequently assume causal sufficiency, disregarding the presence of unobserved confounding variables. Causal sufficiency is both unrealistic and empirically untestable. Additionally, existing methods make strong parametric assumptions about the underlying causal generative process to guarantee the identifiability of confounding variables. Relaxing the causal sufficiency and parametric assumptions and leveraging recent advancements in causal discovery and confounding analysis with non-i.i.d. data, we propose a comprehensive approach for detecting and measuring confounding. We consider various definitions of confounding and introduce tailored methodologies to achieve three objectives: (i) detecting and measuring confounding among a set of variables, (ii) separating observed and unobserved confounding effects, and (iii) understanding the relative strengths of confounding bias between different sets of variables. We present useful properties of a confounding measure and present measures that satisfy those properties. Empirical results support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>DarkSAM: Fooling Segment Anything Model to Segment Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained much attention for its outstanding generalization to unseen data and tasks. Despite its promising prospect, the vulnerabilities of SAM, especially to universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we propose DarkSAM, the first prompt-free universal attack framework against SAM, including a semantic decoupling-based spatial attack and a texture distortion-based frequency attack. We first divide the output of SAM into foreground and background. Then, we design a shadow target strategy to obtain the semantic blueprint of the image as the attack target. DarkSAM is dedicated to fooling SAM by extracting and destroying crucial object features from images in both spatial and frequency domains. In the spatial domain, we disrupt the semantics of both the foreground and background in the image to confuse SAM. In the frequency domain, we further enhance the attack effectiveness by distorting the high-frequency components (i.e., texture information) of the image. Consequently, with a single UAP, DarkSAM renders SAM incapable of segmenting objects across diverse images with varying prompts. Experimental results on four datasets for SAM and its two variant models demonstrate the powerful attack capability and transferability of DarkSAM.</description>

      <title>Learning to Love Edge Cases in Formative Math Assessment: Using the AMMORE Dataset and Chain-of-Thought Prompting to Improve Grading Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AMMORE, a new dataset of 53,000 math open-response question-answer pairs from Rori, a learning platform used by students in several African countries and conducts two experiments to evaluate the use of large language models (LLM) for grading particularly challenging student answers. The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an important resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied, real-world, educational contexts. In experiment 1 we use a variety of LLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier fails to grade accurately. We find that the best-performing approach -- chain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases, effectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%. In experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the improved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing LLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated student mastery of specific lessons. We find that relatively modest improvements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to significant changes in the estimation of student mastery. Where the rules-based classifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery status of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM chain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of students. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable tool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education, potentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in formative assessment.</description>

      <title>Navigation in a simplified Urban Flow through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments requires a strategy to minimize their environmental impact, both in terms of energy efficiency and noise reduction. In order to reduce these concerns, novel strategies for developing prediction models and optimization of flight planning, for instance through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), are needed. Our goal is to develop DRL algorithms capable of enabling the autonomous navigation of UAVs in urban environments, taking into account the presence of buildings and other UAVs, optimizing the trajectories in order to reduce both energetic consumption and noise. This is achieved using fluid-flow simulations which represent the environment in which UAVs navigate and training the UAV as an agent interacting with an urban environment. In this work, we consider a domain domain represented by a two-dimensional flow field with obstacles, ideally representing buildings, extracted from a three-dimensional high-fidelity numerical simulation. The presented methodology, using PPO+LSTM cells, was validated by reproducing a simple but fundamental problem in navigation, namely the Zermelo's problem, which deals with a vessel navigating in a turbulent flow, travelling from a starting point to a target location, optimizing the trajectory. The current method shows a significant improvement with respect to both a simple PPO and a TD3 algorithm, with a success rate (SR) of the PPO+LSTM trained policy of 98.7%, and a crash rate (CR) of 0.1%, outperforming both PPO (SR = 75.6%, CR=18.6%) and TD3 (SR=77.4% and CR=14.5%). This is the first step towards DRL strategies which will guide UAVs in a three-dimensional flow field using real-time signals, making the navigation efficient in terms of flight time and avoiding damages to the vehicle.</description>

      <title>Enhancing elusive clues in knowledge learning by contrasting attention of language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal language models acquire vast amount of knowledge from general text corpus during pretraining, but the efficiency of knowledge learning is known to be unsatisfactory, especially when learning from knowledge-dense and small-sized corpora. The deficiency can come from long-distance dependencies which are hard to capture by language models, and overfitting to co-occurrence patterns and distracting clues in the training text. To address these issues, the paper proposes a method to enhance knowledge learning during language model pretraining, by enhancing elusive but important clues in text discovered by the language model themselves. We found that larger language models pay more attention to non-obvious but important clues, which are often overlooked by smaller language models. Therefore, we can identify these clues by contrasting the attention weights of large and small language models. We use the identified clues as a guide to perform token-dropout data augmentation on the training text, and observed a significant boost in both small and large models' performance in fact memorization. This shows that the behavior contrast between more and less-performant language models contains important clues for knowledge learning, and it can be ``amplified" for a straight-forward improvement in knowledge learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>CRoP: Context-wise Robust Static Human-Sensing Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement in deep learning and internet-of-things have led to diverse human sensing applications. However, distinct patterns in human sensing, influenced by various factors or contexts, challenge generic neural network model's performance due to natural distribution shifts. To address this, personalization tailors models to individual users. Yet most personalization studies overlook intra-user heterogeneity across contexts in sensory data, limiting intra-user generalizability. This limitation is especially critical in clinical applications, where limited data availability hampers both generalizability and personalization. Notably, intra-user sensing attributes are expected to change due to external factors such as treatment progression, further complicating the challenges.This work introduces CRoP, a novel static personalization approach using an off-the-shelf pre-trained model and pruning to optimize personalization and generalization. CRoP shows superior personalization effectiveness and intra-user robustness across four human-sensing datasets, including two from real-world health domains, highlighting its practical and social impact. Additionally, to support CRoP's generalization ability and design choices, we provide empirical justification through gradient inner product analysis, ablation studies, and comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Role-RL: Online Long-Context Processing with Role Reinforcement Learning for Distinct LLMs in Their Optimal Roles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with long-context processing are still challenging because of their implementation complexity, training efficiency and data sparsity. To address this issue, a new paradigm named Online Long-context Processing (OLP) is proposed when we process a document of unlimited length, which typically occurs in the information reception and organization of diverse streaming media such as automated news reporting, live e-commerce, and viral short videos. Moreover, a dilemma was often encountered when we tried to select the most suitable LLM from a large number of LLMs amidst explosive growth aiming for outstanding performance, affordable prices, and short response delays. In view of this, we also develop Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline according to their actual performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on our OLP-MINI dataset and it is found that OLP with Role-RL framework achieves OLP benchmark with an average recall rate of 93.2% and the LLM cost saved by 79.4%. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Role-RL.</description>

      <title>Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanation is key to people having confidence in high-stakes AI systems. However, machine-learning-based systems - which account for almost all current AI - can't explain because they are usually black boxes. The explainable AI (XAI) movement hedges this problem by redefining "explanation". The human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) movement identifies the explanation-oriented needs of users but can't fulfill them because of its commitment to machine learning. In order to achieve the kinds of explanations needed by real people operating in critical domains, we must rethink how to approach AI. We describe a hybrid approach to developing cognitive agents that uses a knowledge-based infrastructure supplemented by data obtained through machine learning when applicable. These agents will serve as assistants to humans who will bear ultimate responsibility for the decisions and actions of the human-robot team. We illustrate the explanatory potential of such agents using the under-the-hood panels of a demonstration system in which a team of simulated robots collaborates on a search task assigned by a human.</description>

      <title>Infer Human's Intentions Before Following Natural Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For AI agents to be helpful to humans, they should be able to follow natural language instructions to complete everyday cooperative tasks in human environments. However, real human instructions inherently possess ambiguity, because the human speakers assume sufficient prior knowledge about their hidden goals and intentions. Standard language grounding and planning methods fail to address such ambiguities because they do not model human internal goals as additional partially observable factors in the environment. We propose a new framework, Follow Instructions with Social and Embodied Reasoning (FISER), aiming for better natural language instruction following in collaborative embodied tasks. Our framework makes explicit inferences about human goals and intentions as intermediate reasoning steps. We implement a set of Transformer-based models and evaluate them over a challenging benchmark, HandMeThat. We empirically demonstrate that using social reasoning to explicitly infer human intentions before making action plans surpasses purely end-to-end approaches. We also compare our implementation with strong baselines, including Chain of Thought prompting on the largest available pre-trained language models, and find that FISER provides better performance on the embodied social reasoning tasks under investigation, reaching the state-of-the-art on HandMeThat.</description>

      <title>Confident Teacher, Confident Student? A Novel User Study Design for Investigating the Didactic Potential of Explanations and their Impact on Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of explanations in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is to this day a challenging problem, with ongoing debate in the research community. While some advocate for establishing standardized offline metrics, others emphasize the importance of human-in-the-loop (HIL) evaluation. Here we propose an experimental design to evaluate the potential of XAI in human-AI collaborative settings as well as the potential of XAI for didactics. In a user study with 1200 participants we investigate the impact of explanations on human performance on a challenging visual task - annotation of biological species in complex taxonomies. Our results demonstrate the potential of XAI in complex visual annotation tasks: users become more accurate in their annotations and demonstrate less uncertainty with AI assistance. The increase in accuracy was, however, not significantly different when users were shown the mere prediction of the model compared to when also providing an explanation. We also find negative effects of explanations: users tend to replicate the model's predictions more often when shown explanations, even when those predictions are wrong. When evaluating the didactic effects of explanations in collaborative human-AI settings, we find that users' annotations are not significantly better after performing annotation with AI assistance. This suggests that explanations in visual human-AI collaboration do not appear to induce lasting learning effects. All code and experimental data can be found in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/TeodorChiaburu/beexplainable.</description>

      <title>Cross Dataset Analysis and Network Architecture Repair for Autonomous Car Lane Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer Learning has become one of the standard methods to solve problems to overcome the isolated learning paradigm by utilizing knowledge acquired for one task to solve another related one. However, research needs to be done, to identify the initial steps before inducing transfer learning to applications for further verification and explainablity. In this research, we have performed cross dataset analysis and network architecture repair for the lane detection application in autonomous vehicles. Lane detection is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles driving assistance system. In most circumstances, modern deep-learning-based lane recognition systems are successful, but they struggle with lanes with complex topologies. The proposed architecture, ERFCondLaneNet is an enhancement to the CondlaneNet used for lane identification framework to solve the difficulty of detecting lane lines with complex topologies like dense, curved and fork lines. The newly proposed technique was tested on two common lane detecting benchmarks, CULane and CurveLanes respectively, and two different backbones, ResNet and ERFNet. The researched technique with ERFCondLaneNet, exhibited similar performance in comparison to ResnetCondLaneNet, while using 33% less features, resulting in a reduction of model size by 46%.</description>

      <title>ScriptSmith: A Unified LLM Framework for Enhancing IT Operations via Automated Bash Script Generation, Assessment, and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of site reliability engineering (SRE), the demand for efficient and effective solutions to manage and resolve issues in site and cloud applications is paramount. This paper presents an innovative approach to action automation using large language models (LLMs) for script generation, assessment, and refinement. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, we aim to significantly reduce the human effort involved in writing and debugging scripts, thereby enhancing the productivity of SRE teams. Our experiments focus on Bash scripts, a commonly used tool in SRE, and involve the CodeSift dataset of 100 tasks and the InterCode dataset of 153 tasks. The results show that LLMs can automatically assess and refine scripts efficiently, reducing the need for script validation in an execution environment. Results demonstrate that the framework shows an overall improvement of 7-10% in script generation.</description>

      <title>StressPrompt: Does Stress Impact Large Language Models and Human Performance Similarly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human beings often experience stress, which can significantly influence their performance. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.</description>

      <title>REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human feedback. The labeling process is the most labor-intensive and costly part of the alignment pipeline, and improving its efficiency would have a meaningful impact on AI development. We propose a strategy for sampling a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the most informative response pairs for labeling out of a set of AI-generated responses. Experimental results on synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. We also applied our method to the real-world dataset SHP2, selecting optimal pairs from multiple responses. The model aligned on dissimilar response pairs obtained the best win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on less similar pairs can improve the efficiency of LLM alignment, saving up to 65% of annotators' work.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Content Generation with Domain-Specific Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating domain-specific content using small language models poses challenges, especially when dealing with multiple distinct datasets with minimal overlap. In this study, we explore methods to enable a small language model to produce coherent and relevant outputs for two different domains: stories (Dataset A) and recipes (Dataset B). Our initial experiments show that training individual models on each dataset yields satisfactory results, with each model generating appropriate content within its domain. We find that utilizing custom tokenizers tailored to each dataset significantly enhances generation quality compared to using a generic tokenizer. Attempts to adapt a single model to both domains using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or standard fine-tuning do not yield substantial results, often failing to produce meaningful outputs. Moreover, full fine-tuning without freezing the model's existing weights leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information and only retains knowledge from the new data. To overcome these challenges, we employ a knowledge expansion strategy: training only with additional parameters. This approach enables the model to generate both stories and recipes upon request, effectively handling multiple domains without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge expansion with frozen layers is an effective method for small language models to generate domain-specific content across distinct datasets. This work contributes to the development of efficient multi-domain language models and provides insights into managing catastrophic forgetting in small-scale architectures.</description>

      <title>What Would You Ask When You First Saw $a^2+b^2=c^2$? Evaluating LLM on Curiosity-Driven Questioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can store a massive amount of knowledge, yet their potential to acquire new knowledge remains unknown. We propose a novel evaluation framework that evaluates this capability. This framework prompts LLMs to generate questions about a statement introducing scientific knowledge, simulating a curious person when facing the statement for the first time. We score the qualities of the generated questions, thereby evaluating the knowledge acquisition potential of the LLM. We apply controlled ablation studies to validate our scoring procedures. Additionally, we created a synthetic dataset consisting of 1101 statements in physics, chemistry, and maths with distinct levels of difficulties, 300 general knowledge statements, and 567 incorrect statements. Human evaluations were conducted to validate our model assessments, achieving an approximate weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.7 on all three metrics considered. We find that while large models like GPT-4 and Mistral 8x7b are adept at generating coherent and relevant questions, the smaller Phi-2 model is equally or more effective. This indicates that size does not solely determine a model's knowledge acquisition potential. The proposed framework quantifies a critical model capability that was commonly overlooked and opens up research opportunities for developing more knowledgeable AI systems</description>

      <title>A Multiple-Fill-in-the-Blank Exam Approach for Enhancing Zero-Resource Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fabricate a hallucinatory text. Several methods have been developed to detect such text by semantically comparing it with the multiple versions probabilistically regenerated. However, a significant issue is that if the storyline of each regenerated text changes, the generated texts become incomparable, which worsen detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hallucination detection method that incorporates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam approach to address this storyline-changing issue. First, our method creates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam by masking multiple objects from the original text. Second, prompts an LLM to repeatedly answer this exam. This approach ensures that the storylines of the exam answers align with the original ones. Finally, quantifies the degree of hallucination for each original sentence by scoring the exam answers, considering the potential for \emph{hallucination snowballing} within the original text itself. Experimental results show that our method alone not only outperforms existing methods, but also achieves clearer state-of-the-art performance in the ensembles with existing methods.</description>

      <title>CSCE: Boosting LLM Reasoning by Simultaneous Enhancing of Casual Significance and Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-based reasoning methods like chain of thought (CoT) play a rising role in solving reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, the causal illusions between \textit{a step of reasoning} and \textit{corresponding state transitions} are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Fully automatic extraction of morphological traits from the Web: utopia or reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant morphological traits, their observable characteristics, are fundamental to understand the role played by each species within their ecosystem. However, compiling trait information for even a moderate number of species is a demanding task that may take experts years to accomplish. At the same time, massive amounts of information about species descriptions is available online in the form of text, although the lack of structure makes this source of data impossible to use at scale. To overcome this, we propose to leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and devise a mechanism for gathering and processing information on plant traits in the form of unstructured textual descriptions, without manual curation. We evaluate our approach by automatically replicating three manually created species-trait matrices. Our method managed to find values for over half of all species-trait pairs, with an F1-score of over 75%. Our results suggest that large-scale creation of structured trait databases from unstructured online text is currently feasible thanks to the information extraction capabilities of LLMs, being limited by the availability of textual descriptions covering all the traits of interest.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning for financial data predictions: a systematic review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Literature highlighted that financial time series data pose significant challenges for accurate stock price prediction, because these data are characterized by noise and susceptibility to news; traditional statistical methodologies made assumptions, such as linearity and normality, which are not suitable for the non-linear nature of financial time series; on the other hand, machine learning methodologies are able to capture non linear relationship in the data. To date, neural network is considered the main machine learning tool for the financial prices prediction. Transfer Learning, as a method aimed at transferring knowledge from source tasks to target tasks, can represent a very useful methodological tool for getting better financial prediction capability. Current reviews on the above body of knowledge are mainly focused on neural network architectures, for financial prediction, with very little emphasis on the transfer learning methodology; thus, this paper is aimed at going deeper on this topic by developing a systematic review with respect to application of Transfer Learning for financial market predictions and to challenges/potential future directions of the transfer learning methodologies for stock market predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Guardrails for Safe and Secure Healthcare AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI holds immense promise in addressing global healthcare access challenges, with numerous innovative applications now ready for use across various healthcare domains. However, a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of these domain-specific AI solutions is the lack of robust safety mechanisms to effectively manage issues such as hallucination, misinformation, and ensuring truthfulness. Left unchecked, these risks can compromise patient safety and erode trust in healthcare AI systems. While general-purpose frameworks like Llama Guard are useful for filtering toxicity and harmful content, they do not fully address the stringent requirements for truthfulness and safety in healthcare contexts. This paper examines the unique safety and security challenges inherent to healthcare AI, particularly the risk of hallucinations, the spread of misinformation, and the need for factual accuracy in clinical settings. I propose enhancements to existing guardrails frameworks, such as Nvidia NeMo Guardrails, to better suit healthcare-specific needs. By strengthening these safeguards, I aim to ensure the secure, reliable, and accurate use of AI in healthcare, mitigating misinformation risks and improving patient safety.</description>

      <title>Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by democratic deliberation theory, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI. The Plurals library is available at https://github.com/josh-ashkinaze/plurals and will be continually updated.</description>

      <title>Data-Centric AI Governance: Addressing the Limitations of Model-Focused Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current regulations on powerful AI capabilities are narrowly focused on "foundation" or "frontier" models. However, these terms are vague and inconsistently defined, leading to an unstable foundation for governance efforts. Critically, policy debates often fail to consider the data used with these models, despite the clear link between data and model performance. Even (relatively) "small" models that fall outside the typical definitions of foundation and frontier models can achieve equivalent outcomes when exposed to sufficiently specific datasets. In this work, we illustrate the importance of considering dataset size and content as essential factors in assessing the risks posed by models both today and in the future. More broadly, we emphasize the risk posed by over-regulating reactively and provide a path towards careful, quantitative evaluation of capabilities that can lead to a simplified regulatory environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine learning-based tool to infer key parameters in disk-planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures. Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of two-dimensional density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet--star mass ratio, and the planet's radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA--ES), an evolutionary algorithm tailored for complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network (PPDONet), a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk--planet interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one system in three minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether deterministic or stochastic, models can be viewed as functions designed to approximate a specific quantity of interest. We propose a data-driven framework that aggregates predictions from diverse models into a single, more accurate output. This aggregation approach exploits each model's strengths to enhance overall accuracy. It is non-intrusive - treating models as black-box functions - model-agnostic, requires minimal assumptions, and can combine outputs from a wide range of models, including those from machine learning and numerical solvers. We argue that the aggregation process should be point-wise linear and propose two methods to find an optimal aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation (MEA), which minimizes the aggregate's prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation (MVA), which minimizes its variance. While MEA is inherently more accurate when correlations between models and the target quantity are perfectly known, Minimal Empirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), an empirical version of MVA - consistently outperforms Minimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA), the empirical counterpart of MEA, when these correlations must be estimated from data. The key difference is that MEVA constructs an aggregate by estimating model errors, while MEEA treats the models as features for direct interpolation of the quantity of interest. This makes MEEA more susceptible to overfitting and poor generalization, where the aggregate may underperform individual models during testing. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework in various applications, such as data science and partial differential equations, showing how it successfully integrates traditional solvers with machine learning models to improve both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the Vulnerability of Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation within Knowledge-Intensive Application Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17275</link>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&amp;A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&amp;A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.</description>

      <title>Memory Networks: Towards Fully Biologically Plausible Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence faces significant challenges in achieving both biological plausibility and computational efficiency, particularly in visual learning tasks. Current artificial neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, rely on techniques like backpropagation and weight sharing, which do not align with the brain's natural information processing methods. To address these issues, we propose the Memory Network, a model inspired by biological principles that avoids backpropagation and convolutions, and operates in a single pass. This approach enables rapid and efficient learning, mimicking the brain's ability to adapt quickly with minimal exposure to data. Our experiments demonstrate that the Memory Network achieves efficient and biologically plausible learning, showing strong performance on simpler datasets like MNIST. However, further refinement is needed for the model to handle more complex datasets such as CIFAR10, highlighting the need to develop new algorithms and techniques that closely align with biological processes while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>SpoofCeleb: Speech Deepfake Detection and SASV In The Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpoofCeleb, a dataset designed for Speech Deepfake Detection (SDD) and Spoofing-robust Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV), utilizing source data from real-world conditions and spoofing attacks generated by Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems also trained on the same real-world data. Robust recognition systems require speech data recorded in varied acoustic environments with different levels of noise to be trained. However, existing datasets typically include clean, high-quality recordings (bona fide data) due to the requirements for TTS training; studio-quality or well-recorded read speech is typically necessary to train TTS models. Existing SDD datasets also have limited usefulness for training SASV models due to insufficient speaker diversity. We present SpoofCeleb, which leverages a fully automated pipeline that processes the VoxCeleb1 dataset, transforming it into a suitable form for TTS training. We subsequently train 23 contemporary TTS systems. The resulting SpoofCeleb dataset comprises over 2.5 million utterances from 1,251 unique speakers, collected under natural, real-world conditions. The dataset includes carefully partitioned training, validation, and evaluation sets with well-controlled experimental protocols. We provide baseline results for both SDD and SASV tasks. All data, protocols, and baselines are publicly available at https://jungjee.github.io/spoofceleb.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Plasticity and Loss Sharpness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, continual learning, a prediction setting in which the problem environment may evolve over time, has become an increasingly popular research field due to the framework's gearing towards complex, non-stationary objectives. Learning such objectives requires plasticity, or the ability of a neural network to adapt its predictions to a different task. Recent findings indicate that plasticity loss on new tasks is highly related to loss landscape sharpness in non-stationary RL frameworks. We explore the usage of sharpness regularization techniques, which seek out smooth minima and have been touted for their generalization capabilities in vanilla prediction settings, in efforts to combat plasticity loss. Our findings indicate that such techniques have no significant effect on reducing plasticity loss.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Nuances: A Fine-grained Evaluation of Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel evaluation framework for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task. It aims to diagnose current models for various instruction categories at a finer-grained level. The framework is structured around the context-free grammar (CFG) of the task. The CFG serves as the basis for the problem decomposition and the core premise of the instruction categories design. We propose a semi-automatic method for CFG construction with the help of Large-Language Models (LLMs). Then, we induct and generate data spanning five principal instruction categories (i.e. direction change, landmark recognition, region recognition, vertical movement, and numerical comprehension). Our analysis of different models reveals notable performance discrepancies and recurrent issues. The stagnation of numerical comprehension, heavy selective biases over directional concepts, and other interesting findings contribute to the development of future language-guided navigation systems.</description>

      <title>KIPPS: Knowledge infusion in Privacy Preserving Synthetic Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of privacy measures, including differential privacy techniques, ensures a provable privacy guarantee for the synthetic data. However, challenges arise for Generative Deep Learning models when tasked with generating realistic data, especially in critical domains such as Cybersecurity and Healthcare. Generative Models optimized for continuous data struggle to model discrete and non-Gaussian features that have domain constraints. Challenges increase when the training datasets are limited and not diverse. In such cases, generative models create synthetic data that repeats sensitive features, which is a privacy risk. Moreover, generative models face difficulties comprehending attribute constraints in specialized domains. This leads to the generation of unrealistic data that impacts downstream accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model, KIPPS, that infuses Domain and Regulatory Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs into Generative Deep Learning models for enhanced Privacy Preserving Synthetic data generation. The novel framework augments the training of generative models with supplementary context about attribute values and enforces domain constraints during training. This added guidance enhances the model's capacity to generate realistic and domain-compliant synthetic data. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world datasets, specifically in the domains of Cybersecurity and Healthcare, where domain constraints and rules add to the complexity of the data. Our experiments evaluate the privacy resilience and downstream accuracy of the model against benchmark methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the balance between privacy preservation and data accuracy in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Block Expanded DINORET: Adapting Natural Domain Foundation Models for Retinal Imaging Without Catastrophic Forgetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating deep learning into medical imaging is poised to greatly advance diagnostic methods but it faces challenges with generalizability. Foundation models, based on self-supervised learning, address these issues and improve data efficiency. Natural domain foundation models show promise for medical imaging, but systematic research evaluating domain adaptation, especially using self-supervised learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, remains underexplored. Additionally, little research addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of foundation models. We adapted the DINOv2 vision transformer for retinal imaging classification tasks using self-supervised learning and generated two novel foundation models termed DINORET and BE DINORET. Publicly available color fundus photographs were employed for model development and subsequent fine-tuning for diabetic retinopathy staging and glaucoma detection. We introduced block expansion as a novel domain adaptation strategy and assessed the models for catastrophic forgetting. Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation model in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive performance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving the highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET and BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study highlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal imaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers robust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our findings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to develop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global healthcare inclusivity.</description>

      <title>The Technology of Outrage: Bias in Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used to offload decision making from people. In the past, one of the rationales for this replacement was that machines, unlike people, can be fair and unbiased. Evidence suggests otherwise. We begin by entertaining the ideas that algorithms can replace people and that algorithms cannot be biased. Taken as axioms, these statements quickly lead to absurdity. Spurred on by this result, we investigate the slogans more closely and identify equivocation surrounding the word 'bias.' We diagnose three forms of outrage-intellectual, moral, and political-that are at play when people react emotionally to algorithmic bias. Then we suggest three practical approaches to addressing bias that the AI community could take, which include clarifying the language around bias, developing new auditing methods for intelligent systems, and building certain capabilities into these systems. We conclude by offering a moral regarding the conversations about algorithmic bias that may transfer to other areas of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Koopman-driven grip force prediction through EMG sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss of hand function due to conditions like stroke or multiple sclerosis significantly impacts daily activities. Robotic rehabilitation provides tools to restore hand function, while novel methods based on surface electromyography (sEMG) enable the adaptation of the device's force output according to the user's condition, thereby improving rehabilitation outcomes. This study aims to achieve accurate force estimations during medium wrap grasps using a single sEMG sensor pair, thereby addressing the challenge of escalating sensor requirements for precise predictions. We conducted sEMG measurements on 13 subjects at two forearm positions, validating results with a hand dynamometer. We established flexible signal-processing steps, yielding high peak cross-correlations between the processed sEMG signal (representing meaningful muscle activity) and grip force. Influential parameters were subsequently identified through sensitivity analysis. Leveraging a novel data-driven Koopman operator theory-based approach and problem-specific data lifting techniques, we devised a methodology for the estimation and short-term prediction of grip force from processed sEMG signals. A weighted mean absolute percentage error (wMAPE) of approx. 5.5% was achieved for the estimated grip force, whereas predictions with a 0.5-second prediction horizon resulted in a wMAPE of approx. 17.9%. The methodology proved robust regarding precise electrode positioning, as the effect of sensing position on error metrics was non-significant. The algorithm executes exceptionally fast, processing, estimating, and predicting a 0.5-second sEMG signal batch in just approx. 30 ms, facilitating real-time implementation.</description>

      <title>The Overfocusing Bias of Convolutional Neural Networks: A Saliency-Guided Regularization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite transformers being considered as the new standard in computer vision, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still outperform them in low-data regimes. Nonetheless, CNNs often make decisions based on narrow, specific regions of input images, especially when training data is limited. This behavior can severely compromise the model's generalization capabilities, making it disproportionately dependent on certain features that might not represent the broader context of images. While the conditions leading to this phenomenon remain elusive, the primary intent of this article is to shed light on this observed behavior of neural networks. Our research endeavors to prioritize comprehensive insight and to outline an initial response to this phenomenon. In line with this, we introduce Saliency Guided Dropout (SGDrop), a pioneering regularization approach tailored to address this specific issue. SGDrop utilizes attribution methods on the feature map to identify and then reduce the influence of the most salient features during training. This process encourages the network to diversify its attention and not focus solely on specific standout areas. Our experiments across several visual classification benchmarks validate SGDrop's role in enhancing generalization. Significantly, models incorporating SGDrop display more expansive attributions and neural activity, offering a more comprehensive view of input images in contrast to their traditionally trained counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional retrieval methods have been essential for assessing document similarity but struggle with capturing semantic nuances. Despite advancements in latent semantic analysis (LSA) and deep learning, achieving comprehensive semantic understanding and accurate retrieval remains challenging due to high dimensionality and semantic gaps. The above challenges call for new techniques to effectively reduce the dimensions and close the semantic gaps. To this end, we propose VectorSearch, which leverages advanced algorithms, embeddings, and indexing techniques for refined retrieval. By utilizing innovative multi-vector search operations and encoding searches with advanced language models, our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets show that VectorSearch outperforms baseline metrics, demonstrating its efficacy for large-scale retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Beyond Redundancy: Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Structure Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Learning (UMGL) aims to learn node representations on various edge types without manual labeling. However, existing research overlooks a key factor: the reliability of the graph structure. Real-world data often exhibit a complex nature and contain abundant task-irrelevant noise, severely compromising UMGL's performance. Moreover, existing methods primarily rely on contrastive learning to maximize mutual information across different graphs, limiting them to multiplex graph redundant scenarios and failing to capture view-unique task-relevant information. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly learn a fused graph from multiple graphs that preserve sufficient task-relevant information while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses graph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously maximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby tackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph. Theoretical analyses further guarantee the effectiveness of InfoMGF. Comprehensive experiments against various baselines on different downstream tasks demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. Surprisingly, our unsupervised method even beats the sophisticated supervised approaches. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/zxlearningdeep/InfoMGF.</description>

      <title>AgRegNet: A Deep Regression Network for Flower and Fruit Density Estimation, Localization, and Counting in Orchards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major challenges for the agricultural industry today is the uncertainty in manual labor availability and the associated cost. Automated flower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help streamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies such as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep regression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of flower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or polygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a U-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified ConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on information from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and attention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit features while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental evaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured orchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as measured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error (pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density, count, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and mAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For fruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the proposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable for sparsely and densely located objects. This simplified technique will be highly applicable for growers to accurately estimate yields and decide on optimal chemical and mechanical flower thinning practices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Recommendation with Denoising Auxiliary Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The historical interaction sequences of users plays a crucial role in training recommender systems that can accurately predict user preferences. However, due to the arbitrariness of user behavior, the presence of noise in these sequences poses a challenge to predicting their next actions in recommender systems. To address this issue, our motivation is based on the observation that training noisy sequences and clean sequences (sequences without noise) with equal weights can impact the performance of the model. We propose a novel self-supervised Auxiliary Task Joint Training (ATJT) method aimed at more accurately reweighting noisy sequences in recommender systems. Specifically, we strategically select subsets from users' original sequences and perform random replacements to generate artificially replaced noisy sequences. Subsequently, we perform joint training on these artificially replaced noisy sequences and the original sequences. Through effective reweighting, we incorporate the training results of the noise recognition model into the recommender model. We evaluate our method on three datasets using a consistent base model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of introducing self-supervised auxiliary task to enhance the base model's performance.</description>

      <title>Transient Adversarial 3D Projection Attacks on Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving. While existing research has proposed various attacks on object detection, such as those using adversarial patches or stickers, the exploration of projection attacks on 3D surfaces remains largely unexplored. Compared to adversarial patches or stickers, which have fixed adversarial patterns, projection attacks allow for transient modifications to these patterns, enabling a more flexible attack. In this paper, we introduce an adversarial 3D projection attack specifically targeting object detection in autonomous driving scenarios. We frame the attack formulation as an optimization problem, utilizing a combination of color mapping and geometric transformation models. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack in deceiving YOLOv3 and Mask R-CNN in physical settings. Evaluations conducted in an indoor environment show an attack success rate of up to 100% under low ambient light conditions, highlighting the potential damage of our attack in real-world driving scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this theoretical article, a sociotechnical approach is proposed to characterize. First, the business ecosystem, focusing on the relationships among Providers, Enterprise, and Customers through SCM, ERP, and CRM platforms to align: (1) Business Intelligence (BI), Fuzzy Logic (FL), and TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), through the OID model, and (2) Knowledge Management (KM) and Imperfect Knowledge Management (IKM), through the OIDK model. Second, the article explores the E-GenAI business ecosystem, which integrates GenAI-based platforms for SCM, ERP, and CRM with GenAI-based platforms for BI, FL, TRIZ, KM, and IKM, to align Large Language Models (LLMs) through the E-GenAI (OID) model. Finally, to understand the dynamics of LLMs, we utilize finite automata to model the relationships between Followers and Followees. This facilitates the construction of LLMs that can identify specific characteristics of users on a social media platform.</description>

      <title>From Deception to Detection: The Dual Roles of Large Language Models in Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information ecosystems and public trust. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones. Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.</description>

      <title>Solar Active Regions Emergence Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the formation of active regions (ARs) on the solar surface. Using the Doppler shift velocity, the continuum intensity, and the magnetic field observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have created time-series datasets of acoustic power and magnetic flux, which are used to train LSTM models on predicting continuum intensity, 12 hours in advance. These novel machine learning (ML) models are able to capture variations of the acoustic power density associated with upcoming magnetic flux emergence and continuum intensity decrease. Testing of the models' performance was done on data for 5 ARs, unseen from the models during training. Model 8, the best performing model trained, was able to make a successful prediction of emergence for all testing active regions in an experimental setting and three of them in an operational. The model predicted the emergence of AR11726, AR13165, and AR13179 respectively 10, 29, and 5 hours in advance, and variations of this model achieved average RMSE values of 0.11 for both active and quiet areas on the solar disc. This work sets the foundations for ML-aided prediction of solar ARs.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Gems in Early Layers: Accelerating Long-Context LLMs with 1000x Input Token Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling long context inputs, but this comes at the cost of increased computational resources and latency. Our research introduces a novel approach for the long context bottleneck to accelerate LLM inference and reduce GPU memory consumption. Our research demonstrates that LLMs can identify relevant tokens in the early layers before generating answers to a query. Leveraging this insight, we propose an algorithm that uses early layers of an LLM as filters to select and compress input tokens, significantly reducing the context length for subsequent processing. Our method, GemFilter, demonstrates substantial improvements in both speed and memory efficiency compared to existing techniques, such as standard attention and SnapKV/H2O. Notably, it achieves a 2.4$\times$ speedup and 30\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to SOTA methods. Evaluation on the Needle in a Haystack task shows that GemFilter significantly outperforms standard attention, SnapKV and demonstrates comparable performance on the LongBench challenge. GemFilter is simple, training-free, and broadly applicable across different LLMs. Crucially, it provides interpretability by allowing humans to inspect the selected input sequence. These findings not only offer practical benefits for LLM deployment, but also enhance our understanding of LLM internal mechanisms, paving the way for further optimizations in LLM design and inference. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/GemFilter}.</description>

      <title>HDFlow: Enhancing LLM Complex Problem-Solving with Hybrid Thinking and Dynamic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), their performance on complex reasoning problems requiring multi-step thinking and combining various skills is still limited. To address this, we propose a novel framework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow thinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key components: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic Workflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable sub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or symbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general framework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem complexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically synthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for complex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs on this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies. Experiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow thinking with dynamic workflows significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, and hybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective balance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our hybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. The results showcase the promise of slow thinking, dynamic workflows, and hybrid thinking in expanding the frontier of complex problem-solving with LLMs\footnote{Code and data will be released at \url{https://github.com/wenlinyao/HDFlow}.}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is central to contemporary mechanical design. However, it encounters challenges in achieving precise parametric sketch modeling and lacks practical evaluation metrics suitable for mechanical design. We harness the capabilities of pre-trained foundation models, renowned for their successes in natural language processing and computer vision, to develop generative models specifically for CAD. These models are adept at understanding complex geometries and design reasoning, a crucial advancement in CAD technology. In this paper, we propose CadVLM, an end-to-end vision language model for CAD generation. Our approach involves adapting pre-trained foundation models to manipulate engineering sketches effectively, integrating both sketch primitive sequences and sketch images. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on multiple CAD sketch generation tasks such as CAD autocompletion, CAD autoconstraint, and image conditional generation. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) being successfully applied to parametric CAD generation, representing a pioneering step in the field of computer-aided mechanical design.</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction methods have finite-sample distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees. However, they generally do not offer conditional coverage guarantees, which can be important for high-stakes decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to train a regression function to improve the conditional coverage after applying the split conformal prediction procedure. We establish an upper bound for the miscoverage gap between the conditional coverage and the nominal coverage rate and propose an end-to-end algorithm to control this upper bound. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method empirically on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Multi-trait Essay Scoring via Reinforcement Learning with Scoring-aware Multiple Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in automated essay scoring (AES) have shifted towards evaluating multiple traits to provide enriched feedback. Like typical AES systems, multi-trait AES employs the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) to measure agreement with human raters, aligning closely with the rating schema; however, its non-differentiable nature prevents its direct use in neural network training. In this paper, we propose Scoring-aware Multi-reward Reinforcement Learning (SaMRL), which integrates actual evaluation schemes into the training process by designing QWK-based rewards with a mean-squared error penalty for multi-trait AES. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) applications in AES are limited to classification models despite associated performance degradation, as RL requires probability distributions; instead, we adopt an autoregressive score generation framework to leverage token generation probabilities for robust multi-trait score predictions. Empirical analyses demonstrate that SaMRL facilitates model training, notably enhancing scoring of previously inferior prompts.</description>

      <title>Uni-Med: A Unified Medical Generalist Foundation Model For Multi-Task Learning Via Connector-MoE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities as a general-purpose interface for various visual and linguistic tasks. However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks. Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>NeuroPath: A Neural Pathway Transformer for Joining the Dots of Human Connectomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.</description>

Abstract: In federated learning, the heterogeneity of client data has a great impact on the performance of model training. Many heterogeneity issues in this process are raised by non-independently and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. This study focuses on the issue of label distribution skew. To address it, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework called HFLDD, which integrates dataset distillation to generate approximately independent and equally distributed (IID) data, thereby improving the performance of model training. Particularly, we partition the clients into heterogeneous clusters, where the data labels among different clients within a cluster are unbalanced while the data labels among different clusters are balanced. The cluster headers collect distilled data from the corresponding cluster members, and conduct model training in collaboration with the server. This training process is like traditional federated learning on IID data, and hence effectively alleviates the impact of Non-IID data on model training. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method with typical baseline methods on public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that when the data labels are severely imbalanced, the proposed HFLDD outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both test accuracy and communication cost.</description>

      <title>Multi-Designated Detector Watermarking for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of \emph{multi-designated detector watermarking (MDDW)} for large language models (LLMs). This technique allows model providers to generate watermarked outputs from LLMs with two key properties: (i) only specific, possibly multiple, designated detectors can identify the watermarks, and (ii) there is no perceptible degradation in the output quality for ordinary users. We formalize the security definitions for MDDW and present a framework for constructing MDDW for any LLM using multi-designated verifier signatures (MDVS). Recognizing the significant economic value of LLM outputs, we introduce claimability as an optional security feature for MDDW, enabling model providers to assert ownership of LLM outputs within designated-detector settings. To support claimable MDDW, we propose a generic transformation converting any MDVS to a claimable MDVS. Our implementation of the MDDW scheme highlights its advanced functionalities and flexibility over existing methods, with satisfactory performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Robotic Environmental State Recognition with Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models and Black-Box Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order for robots to autonomously navigate and operate in diverse environments, it is essential for them to recognize the state of their environment. On the other hand, the environmental state recognition has traditionally involved distinct methods tailored to each state to be recognized. In this study, we perform a unified environmental state recognition for robots through the spoken language with pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. We apply Visual Question Answering and Image-to-Text Retrieval, which are tasks of Vision-Language Models. We show that with our method, it is possible to recognize not only whether a room door is open/closed, but also whether a transparent door is open/closed and whether water is running in a sink, without training neural networks or manual programming. In addition, the recognition accuracy can be improved by selecting appropriate texts from the set of prepared texts based on black-box optimization. For each state recognition, only the text set and its weighting need to be changed, eliminating the need to prepare multiple different models and programs, and facilitating the management of source code and computer resource. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and apply it to the recognition behavior on a mobile robot, Fetch.</description>

      <title>EAGLE: Egocentric AGgregated Language-video Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of egocentric video analysis brings new insights into understanding human activities and intentions from a first-person perspective. Despite this progress, the fragmentation in tasks like action recognition, procedure learning, and moment retrieval, \etc, coupled with inconsistent annotations and isolated model development, hinders a holistic interpretation of video content. In response, we introduce the EAGLE (Egocentric AGgregated Language-video Engine) model and the EAGLE-400K dataset to provide a unified framework that integrates various egocentric video understanding tasks. EAGLE-400K, the \textit{first} large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for egocentric video, features 400K diverse samples to enhance a broad spectrum of tasks from activity recognition to procedure knowledge learning. Moreover, EAGLE, a strong video multimodal large language model (MLLM), is designed to effectively capture both spatial and temporal information. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics designed to facilitate a thorough assessment of MLLM for egocentric video understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate EAGLE's superior performance over existing models, highlighting its ability to balance task-specific understanding with holistic video interpretation. With EAGLE, we aim to pave the way for research opportunities and practical applications in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Drone Stereo Vision for Radiata Pine Branch Detection and Distance Measurement: Integrating SGBM and Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual pruning of radiata pine trees presents significant safety risks due to their substantial height and the challenging terrains in which they thrive. To address these risks, this research proposes the development of a drone-based pruning system equipped with specialized pruning tools and a stereo vision camera, enabling precise detection and trimming of branches. Deep learning algorithms, including YOLO and Mask R-CNN, are employed to ensure accurate branch detection, while the Semi-Global Matching algorithm is integrated to provide reliable distance estimation. The synergy between these techniques facilitates the precise identification of branch locations and enables efficient, targeted pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined implementation of YOLO and SGBM enables the drone to accurately detect branches and measure their distances from the drone. This research not only improves the safety and efficiency of pruning operations but also makes a significant contribution to the advancement of drone technology in the automation of agricultural and forestry practices, laying a foundational framework for further innovations in environmental management.</description>

      <title>SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. Codes and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG}.</description>

      <title>On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training on general domain data followed by adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g. LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA is equivalent to injecting some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters coming from their full fine-tuning, and we quantify the variance of the injected noise. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between the noise distribution and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of LoRA and FLoRA are very close to differentially private full fine-tuning the adapters, which suggests that low-rank adaptation implicitly provides privacy w.r.t the fine-tuning data. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient clipping, low-rank adaptation is almost equivalent to differentially private full fine-tuning adapters with a fixed noise scale.</description>

      <title>Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO): Keey the Easy, Refine the Difficult</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference optimization methods typically begin training with a well-trained SFT model as a reference model. In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is used during the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding the generation of anomalous responses. When the reference model is already well-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, this approach can produce a well-aligned model. However, if the reference model is not aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from its current state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment. In this study, we propose \textbf{Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO)} to address this issue. MIPO modulates the degree of intervention from the reference model based on how well the given data is aligned with it. If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased to prevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model. Conversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitate more extensive training. We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO using Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench. The experimental results demonstrate that MIPO consistently outperforms DPO across various evaluation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Triple Point Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 3D mask learning methods encounter performance bottlenecks under limited data, and our objective is to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce a triple point masking scheme, named TPM, which serves as a scalable framework for pre-training of masked autoencoders to achieve multi-mask learning for 3D point clouds. Specifically, we augment the baselines with two additional mask choices (i.e., medium mask and low mask) as our core insight is that the recovery process of an object can manifest in diverse ways. Previous high-masking schemes focus on capturing the global representation but lack the fine-grained recovery capability, so that the generated pre-trained weights tend to play a limited role in the fine-tuning process. With the support of the proposed TPM, available methods can exhibit more flexible and accurate completion capabilities, enabling the potential autoencoder in the pre-training stage to consider multiple representations of a single 3D object. In addition, an SVM-guided weight selection module is proposed to fill the encoder parameters for downstream networks with the optimal weight during the fine-tuning stage, maximizing linear accuracy and facilitating the acquisition of intricate representations for new objects. Extensive experiments show that the four baselines equipped with the proposed TPM achieve comprehensive performance improvements on various downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Space Post-Training of Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have made significant advancements in the field of image generation in recent years. One major advantage of LDMs is their ability to operate in a compressed latent space, allowing for more efficient training and deployment. However, despite these advantages, challenges with LDMs still remain. For example, it has been observed that LDMs often generate high-frequency details and complex compositions imperfectly. We hypothesize that one reason for these flaws is due to the fact that all pre- and post-training of LDMs are done in latent space, which is typically $8 \times 8$ lower spatial-resolution than the output images. To address this issue, we propose adding pixel-space supervision in the post-training process to better preserve high-frequency details. Experimentally, we show that adding a pixel-space objective significantly improves both supervised quality fine-tuning and preference-based post-training by a large margin on a state-of-the-art DiT transformer and U-Net diffusion models in both visual quality and visual flaw metrics, while maintaining the same text alignment quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the increasing mental health challenges faced by college students, we sought to understand their perspectives on how AI applications, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can be leveraged to enhance their mental well-being. Through pilot interviews with ten diverse students, we explored their opinions on the use of LLMs across five fictional scenarios: General Information Inquiry, Initial Screening, Reshaping Patient-Expert Dynamics, Long-term Care, and Follow-up Care. Our findings revealed that students' acceptance of LLMs varied by scenario, with participants highlighting both potential benefits, such as proactive engagement and personalized follow-up care, and concerns, including limitations in training data and emotional support. These insights inform how AI technology should be designed and implemented to effectively support and enhance students' mental well-being, particularly in scenarios where LLMs can complement traditional methods, while maintaining empathy and respecting individual preferences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Structured-Data Retrieval with GraphRAG: Soccer Data Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains.</description>

      <title>Let the Quantum Creep In: Designing Quantum Neural Network Models by Gradually Swapping Out Classical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its multiplier effect and wide applications in multiple areas, could potentially be an important application of quantum computing. Since modern AI systems are often built on neural networks, the design of quantum neural networks becomes a key challenge in integrating quantum computing into AI. To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model. We start with a simple three-layer classical neural network without any normalisation layers or activation functions, and gradually change the classical layers to the corresponding quantum versions. We conduct numerical experiments on image classification datasets such as the MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate the change of performance brought by the systematic introduction of quantum components. Through this framework, our research sheds new light on the design of future quantum neural network models where it could be more favourable to search for methods and frameworks that harness the advantages from both the classical and quantum worlds.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Banking Dataset: Understanding Client Needs through Event Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial organizations collect a huge amount of data about clients that typically has a temporal (sequential) structure and is collected from various sources (modalities). Due to privacy issues, there are no large-scale open-source multimodal datasets of event sequences, which significantly limits the research in this area. In this paper, we present the industrial-scale publicly available multimodal banking dataset, MBD, that contains more than 1.5M corporate clients with several modalities: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of dialogues with technical support and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank's products. All entries are properly anonymized from real proprietary bank data. Using this dataset, we introduce a novel benchmark with two business tasks: campaigning (purchase prediction in the next month) and matching of clients. We provide numerical results that demonstrate the superiority of our multi-modal baselines over single-modal techniques for each task. As a result, the proposed dataset can open new perspectives and facilitate the future development of practically important large-scale multimodal algorithms for event sequences.

      <title>Improving Fast Adversarial Training via Self-Knowledge Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks. Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the numerical manifold method principle, we developed a mathematical framework of a neural network manifold: Deep Manifold and discovered that neural networks: 1) is numerical computation combining forward and inverse; 2) have near infinite degrees of freedom; 3) exponential learning capacity with depth; 4) have self-progressing boundary conditions; 5) has training hidden bottleneck. We also define two concepts: neural network learning space and deep manifold space and introduce two concepts: neural network intrinsic pathway and fixed point. We raise three fundamental questions: 1). What is the training completion definition; 2). where is the deep learning convergence point (neural network fixed point); 3). How important is token timestamp in training data given negative time is critical in inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Subjective and Objective Quality-of-Experience Evaluation Study for Live Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, live video streaming has gained widespread popularity across various social media platforms. Quality of experience (QoE), which reflects end-users' satisfaction and overall experience, plays a critical role for media service providers to optimize large-scale live compression and transmission strategies to achieve perceptually optimal rate-distortion trade-off. Although many QoE metrics for video-on-demand (VoD) have been proposed, there remain significant challenges in developing QoE metrics for live video streaming. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of subjective and objective QoE evaluations for live video streaming. For the subjective QoE study, we introduce the first live video streaming QoE dataset, TaoLive QoE, which consists of $42$ source videos collected from real live broadcasts and $1,155$ corresponding distorted ones degraded due to a variety of streaming distortions, including conventional streaming distortions such as compression, stalling, as well as live streaming-specific distortions like frame skipping, variable frame rate, etc. Subsequently, a human study was conducted to derive subjective QoE scores of videos in the TaoLive QoE dataset. For the objective QoE study, we benchmark existing QoE models on the TaoLive QoE dataset as well as publicly available QoE datasets for VoD scenarios, highlighting that current models struggle to accurately assess video QoE, particularly for live content. Hence, we propose an end-to-end QoE evaluation model, Tao-QoE, which integrates multi-scale semantic features and optical flow-based motion features to predicting a retrospective QoE score, eliminating reliance on statistical quality of service (QoS) features.</description>

      <title>TA-Cleaner: A Fine-grained Text Alignment Backdoor Defense Strategy for Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Open Digital Rights Enforcement Framework (ODRE): from descriptive to enforceable policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From centralised platforms to decentralised ecosystems, like Data Spaces, sharing data has become a paramount challenge. For this reason, the definition of data usage policies has become crucial in these domains, highlighting the necessity of effective policy enforcement mechanisms. The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a W3C standard ontology designed to describe data usage policies, however, it lacks built-in enforcement capabilities, limiting its practical application. This paper introduces the Open Digital Rights Enforcement (ODRE) framework, whose goal is to provide ODRL with enforcement capabilities. The ODRE framework proposes a novel approach to express ODRL policies that integrates the descriptive ontology terms of ODRL with other languages that allow behaviour specification, such as dynamic data handling or function evaluation. The framework includes an enforcement algorithm for ODRL policies and two open-source implementations in Python and Java. The ODRE framework is also designed to support future extensions of ODRL to specific domain scenarios. In addition, current limitations of ODRE, ODRL, and current challenges are reported. Finally, to demonstrate the enforcement capabilities of the implementations, their performance, and their extensibility features, several experiments have been carried out with positive results.</description>

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling molecular geometry. However, they encounter limitations in effectively capturing long-range interactions in large molecular systems. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural P$^3$M, a versatile enhancer of geometric GNNs to expand the scope of their capabilities by incorporating mesh points alongside atoms and reimaging traditional mathematical operations in a trainable manner. Neural P$^3$M exhibits flexibility across a wide range of molecular systems and demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting energies and forces, outperforming on benchmarks such as the MD22 dataset. It also achieves an average improvement of 22% on the OE62 dataset while integrating with various architectures.</description>

      <title>Hand-object reconstruction via interaction-aware graph attention mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the poses of both a hand and an object has become an important area of research due to the growing need for advanced vision computing. The primary challenge involves understanding and reconstructing how hands and objects interact, such as contact and physical plausibility. Existing approaches often adopt a graph neural network to incorporate spatial information of hand and object meshes. However, these approaches have not fully exploited the potential of graphs without modification of edges within and between hand- and object-graphs. We propose a graph-based refinement method that incorporates an interaction-aware graph-attention mechanism to account for hand-object interactions. Using edges, we establish connections among closely correlated nodes, both within individual graphs and across different graphs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with notable improvements in the realm of physical plausibility.</description>

      <title>P4Q: Learning to Prompt for Quantization in Visual-language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained prominence in various visual and multimodal tasks, yet the deployment of VLMs on downstream application platforms remains challenging due to their prohibitive requirements of training samples and computing resources. Fine-tuning and quantization of VLMs can substantially reduce the sample and computation costs, which are in urgent need. There are two prevailing paradigms in quantization, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) can effectively quantize large-scale VLMs but incur a huge training cost, while low-bit Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) suffers from a notable performance drop. We propose a method that balances fine-tuning and quantization named ``Prompt for Quantization'' (P4Q), in which we design a lightweight architecture to leverage contrastive loss supervision to enhance the recognition performance of a PTQ model. Our method can effectively reduce the gap between image features and text features caused by low-bit quantization, based on learnable prompts to reorganize textual representations and a low-bit adapter to realign the distributions of image and text features. We also introduce a distillation loss based on cosine similarity predictions to distill the quantized model using a full-precision teacher. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our P4Q method outperforms prior arts, even achieving comparable results to its full-precision counterparts. For instance, our 8-bit P4Q can theoretically compress the CLIP-ViT/B-32 by 4 $\times$ while achieving 66.94\% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming the learnable prompt fine-tuned full-precision model by 2.24\% with negligible additional parameters on the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <title>T3: A Novel Zero-shot Transfer Learning Framework Iteratively Training on an Assistant Task for a Target Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long text summarization, gradually being essential for efficiently processing large volumes of information, stays challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA families because of the insufficient open-sourced training datasets and the high requirement of contextual details dealing. To address the issue, we design a novel zero-shot transfer learning framework, abbreviated as T3, to iteratively training a baseline LLM on an assistant task for the target task, where the former should own richer data resources and share structural or semantic similarity with the latter. In practice, T3 is approached to deal with the long text summarization task by utilizing question answering as the assistant task, and further validated its effectiveness on the BBC summary, NarraSum, FairytaleQA, and NLQuAD datasets, with up to nearly 14% improvement in ROUGE, 35% improvement in BLEU, and 16% improvement in Factscore compared to three baseline LLMs, demonstrating its potential for more assistant-target task combinations.</description>

      <title>AssistantX: An LLM-Powered Proactive Assistant in Collaborative Human-Populated Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent assistants in human-populated environments has motivated significant research in autonomous robotic systems. Traditional service robots and virtual assistants, however, struggle with real-world task execution due to their limited capacity for dynamic reasoning and interaction, particularly when human collaboration is required. Recent developments in Large Language Models have opened new avenues for improving these systems, enabling more sophisticated reasoning and natural interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AssistantX, an LLM-powered proactive assistant designed to operate autonomously in a physical office environment. Unlike conventional service robots, AssistantX leverages a novel multi-agent architecture, PPDR4X, which provides advanced inference capabilities and comprehensive collaboration awareness. By effectively bridging the gap between virtual operations and physical interactions, AssistantX demonstrates robust performance in managing complex real-world scenarios. Our evaluation highlights the architecture's effectiveness, showing that AssistantX can respond to clear instructions, actively retrieve supplementary information from memory, and proactively seek collaboration from team members to ensure successful task completion.

      <title>Prototype based Masked Audio Model for Self-Supervised Learning of Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in sound event detection (SED) is the effective utilization of unlabeled data, given the limited availability of labeled data due to high annotation costs. Semi-supervised algorithms rely on labeled data to learn from unlabeled data, and the performance is constrained by the quality and size of the former. In this paper, we introduce the Prototype based Masked Audio Model~(PMAM) algorithm for self-supervised representation learning in SED, to better exploit unlabeled data. Specifically, semantically rich frame-level pseudo labels are constructed from a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based prototypical distribution modeling. These pseudo labels supervise the learning of a Transformer-based masked audio model, in which binary cross-entropy loss is employed instead of the widely used InfoNCE loss, to provide independent loss contributions from different prototypes, which is important in real scenarios in which multiple labels may apply to unsupervised data frames. A final stage of fine-tuning with just a small amount of labeled data yields a very high performing SED model. On like-for-like tests using the DESED task, our method achieves a PSDS1 score of 62.5\%, surpassing current state-of-the-art models and demonstrating the superiority of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Zero- and Few-shot Named Entity Recognition and Text Expansion in Medication Prescriptions using ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Medication prescriptions are often in free text and include a mix of two languages, local brand names, and a wide range of idiosyncratic formats and abbreviations. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising ability to generate text in response to input prompts. We use ChatGPT 3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines. Methods: Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used in a zero- and few-shot setting with different prompt strategies. 100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching. For the task EX, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score. Results: For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set. For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT. Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which would be unacceptable when processing safety-relevant medication data.</description>

      <title>Preserving logical and functional dependencies in synthetic tabular data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependencies among attributes are a common aspect of tabular data. However, whether existing tabular data generation algorithms preserve these dependencies while generating synthetic data is yet to be explored. In addition to the existing notion of functional dependencies, we introduce the notion of logical dependencies among the attributes in this article. Moreover, we provide a measure to quantify logical dependencies among attributes in tabular data. Utilizing this measure, we compare several state-of-the-art synthetic data generation algorithms and test their capability to preserve logical and functional dependencies on several publicly available datasets. We demonstrate that currently available synthetic tabular data generation algorithms do not fully preserve functional dependencies when they generate synthetic datasets. In addition, we also showed that some tabular synthetic data generation models can preserve inter-attribute logical dependencies. Our review and comparison of the state-of-the-art reveal research needs and opportunities to develop task-specific synthetic tabular data generation models.</description>

      <title>Graph Edit Distance with General Costs Using Neural Set Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) measures the (dis-)similarity between two given graphs, in terms of the minimum-cost edit sequence that transforms one graph to the other. However, the exact computation of GED is NP-Hard, which has recently motivated the design of neural methods for GED estimation. However, they do not explicitly account for edit operations with different costs. In response, we propose GRAPHEDX, a neural GED estimator that can work with general costs specified for the four edit operations, viz., edge deletion, edge addition, node deletion and node addition. We first present GED as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that incorporates these four costs. Then, we represent each graph as a set of node and edge embeddings and use them to design a family of neural set divergence surrogates. We replace the QAP terms corresponding to each operation with their surrogates. Computing such neural set divergence require aligning nodes and edges of the two graphs. We learn these alignments using a Gumbel-Sinkhorn permutation generator, additionally ensuring that the node and edge alignments are consistent with each other. Moreover, these alignments are cognizant of both the presence and absence of edges between node-pairs. Experiments on several datasets, under a variety of edit cost settings, show that GRAPHEDX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and heuristics in terms of prediction error.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks trained via empirical risk minimisation often exhibit significant performance disparities across groups, particularly when group and task labels are spuriously correlated (e.g., "grassy background" and "cows"). Existing bias mitigation methods that aim to address this issue often either rely on group labels for training or validation, or require an extensive hyperparameter search. Such data and computational requirements hinder the practical deployment of these methods, especially when datasets are too large to be group-annotated, computational resources are limited, and models are trained through already complex pipelines. In this paper, we propose Targeted Augmentations for Bias Mitigation (TAB), a simple hyperparameter-free framework that leverages the entire training history of a helper model to identify spurious samples, and generate a group-balanced training set from which a robust model can be trained. We show that TAB improves worst-group performance without any group information or model selection, outperforming existing methods while maintaining overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</description>

      <title>MoJE: Mixture of Jailbreak Experts, Naive Tabular Classifiers as Guard for Prompt Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Episodic Memory Verbalization using Hierarchical Representations of Life-Long Robot Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verbalization of robot experience, i.e., summarization of and question answering about a robot's past, is a crucial ability for improving human-robot interaction. Previous works applied rule-based systems or fine-tuned deep models to verbalize short (several-minute-long) streams of episodic data, limiting generalization and transferability. In our work, we apply large pretrained models to tackle this task with zero or few examples, and specifically focus on verbalizing life-long experiences. For this, we derive a tree-like data structure from episodic memory (EM), with lower levels representing raw perception and proprioception data, and higher levels abstracting events to natural language concepts. Given such a hierarchical representation built from the experience stream, we apply a large language model as an agent to interactively search the EM given a user's query, dynamically expanding (initially collapsed) tree nodes to find the relevant information. The approach keeps computational costs low even when scaling to months of robot experience data. We evaluate our method on simulated household robot data, human egocentric videos, and real-world robot recordings, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>AlterMOMA: Fusion Redundancy Pruning for Camera-LiDAR Fusion Models with Alternative Modality Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera-LiDAR fusion models significantly enhance perception performance in autonomous driving. The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScene and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Robust Aggregation for Securing Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a distributed machine learning approach that addresses privacy concerns by training AI models locally on devices. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) extends the FL paradigm by eliminating the central server, thereby enhancing scalability and robustness through the avoidance of a single point of failure. However, DFL faces significant challenges in optimizing security, as most Byzantine-robust algorithms proposed in the literature are designed for centralized scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation algorithm to enhance the security of Decentralized Federated Learning environments, coined WFAgg. This proposal handles the adverse conditions and strength robustness of dynamic decentralized topologies at the same time by employing multiple filters to identify and mitigate Byzantine attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maintaining model accuracy and convergence in the presence of various Byzantine attack scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art centralized Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes (such as Multi-Krum or Clustering). These algorithms are evaluated on an IID image classification problem in both centralized and decentralized scenarios.</description>

      <title>SECURE: Semantics-aware Embodied Conversation under Unawareness for Lifelong Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a challenging interactive task learning scenario we call rearrangement under unawareness: to manipulate a rigid-body environment in a context where the robot is unaware of a concept that's key to solving the instructed task. We propose SECURE, an interactive task learning framework designed to solve such problems by fixing a deficient domain model using embodied conversation. Through dialogue, the robot discovers and then learns to exploit unforeseen possibilities. Using SECURE, the robot not only learns from the user's corrective feedback when it makes a mistake, but it also learns to make strategic dialogue decisions for revealing useful evidence about novel concepts for solving the instructed task. Together, these abilities allow the robot to generalise to subsequent tasks using newly acquired knowledge. We demonstrate that a robot that is semantics-aware -- that is, it exploits the logical consequences of both sentence and discourse semantics in the learning and inference process -- learns to solve rearrangement under unawareness more effectively than a robot that lacks such capabilities.</description>

      <title>Integrating Hierarchical Semantic into Iterative Generation Model for Entailment Tree Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifestly and logically displaying the line of reasoning from evidence to answer is significant to explainable question answering (QA). The entailment tree exhibits the lines structurally, which is different from the self-explanation principle in large-scale language models. Existing methods rarely consider the semantic association of sentences between and within hierarchies within the tree structure, which is prone to apparent mistakes in combinations. In this work, we propose an architecture of integrating the Hierarchical Semantics of sentences under the framework of Controller-Generator (HiSCG) to explain answers. The HiSCG designs a hierarchical mapping between hypotheses and facts, discriminates the facts involved in tree constructions, and optimizes single-step entailments. To the best of our knowledge, We are the first to notice hierarchical semantics of sentences between the same layer and adjacent layers to yield improvements. The proposed method achieves comparable performance on all three settings of the EntailmentBank dataset. The generalization results on two out-of-domain datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Confidence intervals uncovered: Are we ready for real-world medical imaging AI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging is spearheading the AI transformation of healthcare. Performance reporting is key to determine which methods should be translated into clinical practice. Frequently, broad conclusions are simply derived from mean performance values. In this paper, we argue that this common practice is often a misleading simplification as it ignores performance variability. Our contribution is threefold. (1) Analyzing all MICCAI segmentation papers (n = 221) published in 2023, we first observe that more than 50\% of papers do not assess performance variability at all. Moreover, only one (0.5\%) paper reported confidence intervals (CIs) for model performance. (2) To address the reporting bottleneck, we show that the unreported standard deviation (SD) in segmentation papers can be approximated by a second-order polynomial function of the mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Based on external validation data from 56 previous MICCAI challenges, we demonstrate that this approximation can accurately reconstruct the CI of a method using information provided in publications. (3) Finally, we reconstructed 95\% CIs around the mean DSC of MICCAI 2023 segmentation papers. The median CI width was 0.03 which is three times larger than the median performance gap between the first and second ranked method. For more than 60\% of papers, the mean performance of the second-ranked method was within the CI of the first-ranked method. We conclude that current publications typically do not provide sufficient evidence to support which models could potentially be translated into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning under Attack: Improving Gradient Inversion for Batch of Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a machine learning approach able to preserve the privacy of user's data. Applying FL, clients train machine learning models on a local dataset and a central server aggregates the learned parameters coming from the clients, training a global machine learning model without sharing user's data. However, the state-of-the-art shows several approaches to promote attacks on FL systems. For instance, inverting or leaking gradient attacks can find, with high precision, the local dataset used during the training phase of the FL. This paper presents an approach, called Deep Leakage from Gradients with Feedback Blending (DLG-FB), which is able to improve the inverting gradient attack, considering the spatial correlation that typically exists in batches of images. The performed evaluation shows an improvement of 19.18% and 48,82% in terms of attack success rate and the number of iterations per attacked image, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithfulness is arguably the most critical metric to assess the reliability of explainable AI. In NLP, current methods for faithfulness evaluation are fraught with discrepancies and biases, often failing to capture the true reasoning of models. We introduce Adversarial Sensitivity as a novel approach to faithfulness evaluation, focusing on the explainer's response when the model is under adversarial attack. Our method accounts for the faithfulness of explainers by capturing sensitivity to adversarial input changes. This work addresses significant limitations in existing evaluation techniques, and furthermore, quantifies faithfulness from a crucial yet underexplored paradigm.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Shared Relations via Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Preference Optimization: Enhance Your Language Model with Preference Degree Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been significant interest in replacing the reward model in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants. These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise samples, i.e., minimizing and maximizing the loss based on preferred or dis-preferred responses, respectively. However, while this training strategy omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within different responses. We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs from sufficiently understanding human preferences. To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment loss, thereby helping LLMs improve their ability to understand the degree of preference. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets of different tasks. The results demonstrate that SPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing preference optimization methods and significantly boost their performance to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into SPO, which verifies its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/lijian16/SPO.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Language Model Alignment via Integrated Value Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are typically fine-tuned to align with human preferences, but tuning large models is computationally intensive and complex. In this work, we introduce $\textit{Integrated Value Guidance}$ (IVG), a method that uses implicit and explicit value functions to guide language model decoding at token and chunk-level respectively, efficiently aligning large language models purely at inference time. This approach circumvents the complexities of direct fine-tuning and outperforms traditional methods. Empirically, we demonstrate the versatility of IVG across various tasks. In controlled sentiment generation and summarization tasks, our method significantly improves the alignment of large models using inference-time guidance from $\texttt{gpt2}$-based value functions. Moreover, in a more challenging instruction-following benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that both specifically tuned and off-the-shelf value functions greatly improve the length-controlled win rates of large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $19.51\% \rightarrow 26.51\%$ for $\texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}$ and $25.58\% \rightarrow 33.75\%$ for $\texttt{Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1}$ with Tulu guidance).</description>

      <title>Language Models as Zero-shot Lossless Gradient Compressors: Towards General Neural Parameter Prior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10\% up to 17.2\% across various datasets and architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. We will release the source code upon publication.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of Failure Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) on spacecraft, new AI-based approaches are emerging in the state of the art to overcome the limitations commonly imposed by traditional threshold checking.
  The present research aims at characterizing two different approaches to the problem of stuck values detection in multivariate time series coming from spacecraft attitude sensors. The analysis reveals the performance differences in the two approaches, while commenting on their interpretability and generalization to different scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Single-Branch Embedding Network for Recommendation in Cold-Start and Missing Modality Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recommender systems adopt collaborative filtering (CF) and provide recommendations based on past collective interactions. Therefore, the performance of CF algorithms degrades when few or no interactions are available, a scenario referred to as cold-start. To address this issue, previous work relies on models leveraging both collaborative data and side information on the users or items. Similar to multimodal learning, these models aim at combining collaborative and content representations in a shared embedding space. In this work we propose a novel technique for multimodal recommendation, relying on a multimodal Single-Branch embedding network for Recommendation (SiBraR). Leveraging weight-sharing, SiBraR encodes interaction data as well as multimodal side information using the same single-branch embedding network on different modalities. This makes SiBraR effective in scenarios of missing modality, including cold start. Our extensive experiments on large-scale recommendation datasets from three different recommendation domains (music, movie, and e-commerce) and providing multimodal content information (audio, text, image, labels, and interactions) show that SiBraR significantly outperforms CF as well as state-of-the-art content-based RSs in cold-start scenarios, and is competitive in warm scenarios. We show that SiBraR's recommendations are accurate in missing modality scenarios, and that the model is able to map different modalities to the same region of the shared embedding space, hence reducing the modality gap.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Centralized collection and processing of healthcare data across national borders pose significant challenges, including privacy concerns, data heterogeneity and legal barriers. To address some of these challenges, we formed an interdisciplinary consortium to develop a feder-ated health data network, comprised of six institutions across five countries, to facilitate Nordic-Baltic cooperation on secondary use of health data. The objective of this report is to offer early insights into our experiences developing this network. Methods: We used a mixed-method ap-proach, combining both experimental design and implementation science to evaluate the factors affecting the implementation of our network. Results: Technically, our experiments indicate that the network functions without significant performance degradation compared to centralized simu-lation. Conclusion: While use of interdisciplinary approaches holds a potential to solve challeng-es associated with establishing such collaborative networks, our findings turn the spotlight on the uncertain regulatory landscape playing catch up and the significant operational costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Arbitrary Precision Acceleration for Large Language Models on GPU Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied but face challenges in efficient inference. While quantization methods reduce computational demands, ultra-low bit quantization with arbitrary precision is hindered by limited GPU Tensor Core support and inefficient memory management, leading to suboptimal acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs. At its core, we introduce a novel bipolar-INT data format that facilitates parallel computing and supports symmetric quantization, effectively reducing data redundancy. Building on this, we implement an arbitrary precision matrix multiplication scheme that decomposes and recovers matrices at the bit level, enabling flexible precision while maximizing GPU Tensor Core utilization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient matrix preprocessing method that optimizes data layout for subsequent computations. Finally, we design a data recovery-oriented memory management system that strategically utilizes fast shared memory, significantly enhancing kernel execution speed and minimizing memory access latency. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, with up to 13\times speedup in matrix multiplication compared to NVIDIA's CUTLASS. When integrated into LLMs, we achieve up to 6.7\times inference acceleration. These improvements significantly enhance LLM inference efficiency, enabling broader and more responsive applications of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Why Companies "Democratise" Artificial Intelligence: The Case of Open Source Software Donations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companies claim to "democratise" artificial intelligence (AI) when they donate AI open source software (OSS) to non-profit foundations or release AI models, among others, but what does this term mean and why do they do it? As the impact of AI on society and the economy grows, understanding the commercial incentives behind AI democratisation efforts is crucial for ensuring these efforts serve broader interests beyond commercial agendas. Towards this end, this study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate commercial incentives for 43 AI OSS donations to the Linux Foundation. It makes contributions to both research and practice. It contributes a taxonomy of both individual and organisational social, economic, and technological incentives for AI democratisation. In particular, it highlights the role of democratising the governance and control rights of an OSS project (i.e., from one company to open governance) as a structural enabler for downstream goals, such as attracting external contributors, reducing development costs, and influencing industry standards, among others. Furthermore, OSS donations are often championed by individual developers within companies, highlighting the importance of the bottom-up incentives for AI democratisation. The taxonomy provides a framework and toolkit for discerning incentives for other AI democratisation efforts, such as the release of AI models. The paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Acoustic Similarity in Emotional Speech and Music via Self-Supervised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their acoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between these domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music, particularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain largely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have rarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the acoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis of the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain adaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process, examining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly, we explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using Frechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion bias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech and music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can vary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and domain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance SER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study provides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and music, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve SER and MER systems.</description>

      <title>PhantomLiDAR: Cross-modality Signal Injection Attacks against LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a pivotal sensor for autonomous driving, offering precise 3D spatial information. Previous signal attacks against LiDAR systems mainly exploit laser signals. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., injecting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to manipulate LiDAR output. Our insight is that the internal modules of a LiDAR, i.e., the laser receiving circuit, the monitoring sensors, and the beam-steering modules, even with strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, can still couple with the IEMI attack signals and result in the malfunction of LiDAR systems. Based on the above attack surfaces, we propose the PhantomLiDAR attack, which manipulates LiDAR output in terms of Points Interference, Points Injection, Points Removal, and even LiDAR Power-Off. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of PhantomLiDAR with both simulated and real-world experiments on five COTS LiDAR systems. We also conduct feasibility experiments in real-world moving scenarios. We provide potential defense measures that can be implemented at both the sensor level and the vehicle system level to mitigate the risks associated with IEMI attacks.

      <title>Pioneering Reliable Assessment in Text-to-Image Knowledge Editing: Leveraging a Fine-Grained Dataset and an Innovative Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of battery is an important parameter to know the battery's remaining life and need for recharge. The goal of this research project is to develop machine learning-based models for the battery RUL dataset. Different ML models are developed to classify the RUL of the vehicle, and the IoT (Internet of Things) concept is simulated for automating the charging system and managing any faults aligning. The graphs plotted depict the relationship between various vehicle parameters using the Blynk IoT platform. Results show that the catboost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and hybrid model developed could classify RUL into three classes with 99% more accuracy. The data is fed using the tkinter GUI for simulating artificial intelligence (AI)-based charging, and with a pyserial backend, data can be entered into the Esp-32 microcontroller for making charge discharge possible with the model's predictions. Also, with an IoT system, the charging can be disconnected, monitored, and analyzed for automation. The results show that an accuracy of 99% can be obtained on models MLP, catboost model and similar accuracy on GRU model can be obtained, and finally relay-based triggering can be made by prediction through the model used for automating the charging and energy-saving mechanism. By showcasing an exemplary Blynk platform-based monitoring and automation phenomenon, we further present innovative ways of monitoring parameters and automating the system.</description>

      <title>Predicting Anchored Text from Translation Memories for Machine Translation Using Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translation memories (TMs) are the backbone for professional translation tools called computer-aided translation (CAT) tools. In order to perform a translation using a CAT tool, a translator uses the TM to gather translations similar to the desired segment to translate (s'). Many CAT tools offer a fuzzy-match algorithm to locate segments (s) in the TM that are close in distance to s'. After locating two similar segments, the CAT tool will present parallel segments (s, t) that contain one segment in the source language along with its translation in the target language. Additionally, CAT tools contain fuzzy-match repair (FMR) techniques that will automatically use the parallel segments from the TM to create new TM entries containing a modified version of the original with the idea in mind that it will be the translation of s'. Most FMR techniques use machine translation as a way of "repairing" those words that have to be modified. In this article, we show that for a large part of those words which are anchored, we can use other techniques that are based on machine learning approaches such as Word2Vec. BERT, and even ChatGPT. Specifically, we show that for anchored words that follow the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) paradigm, Word2Vec, BERT, and GPT-4 can be used to achieve similar and, for some cases, better results than neural machine translation for translating anchored words from French to English.</description>

      <title>On Translating Technical Terminology: A Translation Workflow for Machine-Translated Acronyms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The typical workflow for a professional translator to translate a document from its source language (SL) to a target language (TL) is not always focused on what many language models in natural language processing (NLP) do - predict the next word in a series of words. While high-resource languages like English and French are reported to achieve near human parity using common metrics for measurement such as BLEU and COMET, we find that an important step is being missed: the translation of technical terms, specifically acronyms. Some state-of-the art machine translation systems like Google Translate which are publicly available can be erroneous when dealing with acronyms - as much as 50% in our findings. This article addresses acronym disambiguation for MT systems by proposing an additional step to the SL-TL (FR-EN) translation workflow where we first offer a new acronym corpus for public consumption and then experiment with a search-based thresholding algorithm that achieves nearly 10% increase when compared to Google Translate and OpusMT.</description>

      <title>Weak-To-Strong Backdoor Attacks for LLMs with Contrastive Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from weak to strong based on contrastive knowledge distillation (W2SAttack). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through contrastive knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of W2SAttack on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</description>

      <title>HydraViT: Stacking Heads for a Scalable ViT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly the Multi-head Attention (MHA) mechanism, imposes substantial hardware demands. Deploying ViTs on devices with varying constraints, such as mobile phones, requires multiple models of different sizes. However, this approach has limitations, such as training and storing each required model separately. This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

      <title>Joint Localization and Planning using Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been successfully applied to robotics problems such as manipulation and vehicle path planning. In this work, we explore their application to end-to-end navigation -- including both perception and planning -- by considering the problem of jointly performing global localization and path planning in known but arbitrary 2D environments. In particular, we introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end localization and planning stack.</description>

      <title>Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction.

      <title>Transferring disentangled representations: bridging the gap between synthetic and real images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Perspective on Machine Unlearning for AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are finetuned to refuse questions about hazardous knowledge, but these protections can often be bypassed. Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.</description>

Abstract: We present HARMONIC, a framework for implementing cognitive robots that transforms general-purpose robots into trusted teammates capable of complex decision-making, natural communication and human-level explanation. The framework supports interoperability between a strategic (cognitive) layer for high-level decision-making and a tactical (robot) layer for low-level control and execution. We describe the core features of the framework and our initial implementation, in which HARMONIC was deployed on a simulated UGV and drone involved in a multi-robot search and retrieval task.</description>

      <title>IFCap: Image-like Retrieval and Frequency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image captioning have explored text-only training methods to overcome the limitations of paired image-text data. However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. Our method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a Fusion Module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, we introduce a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. We integrate these methods into a unified framework, which we refer to as IFCap ($\textbf{I}$mage-like Retrieval and $\textbf{F}$requency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot $\textbf{Cap}$tioning). Through extensive experimentation, our straightforward yet powerful approach has demonstrated its efficacy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both image captioning and video captioning compared to zero-shot captioning based on text-only training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to multi-robot planning and collaboration. We demonstrate a cognitive strategy for robots in human-robot teams that incorporates metacognition, natural language communication, and explainability. The system is embodied using the HARMONIC architecture that flexibly integrates cognitive and control capabilities across the team. We evaluate our approach through simulation experiments involving a joint search task by a team of heterogeneous robots (a UGV and a drone) and a human. We detail the system's handling of complex, real-world scenarios, effective action coordination between robots with different capabilities, and natural human-robot communication. This work demonstrates that the robots' ability to reason about plans, goals, and attitudes, and to provide explanations for actions and decisions are essential prerequisites for realistic human-robot teaming.</description>

      <title>Revisit Anything: Visual Place Recognition via Image Segment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately recognizing a revisited place is crucial for embodied agents to localize and navigate. This requires visual representations to be distinct, despite strong variations in camera viewpoint and scene appearance. Existing visual place recognition pipelines encode the "whole" image and search for matches. This poses a fundamental challenge in matching two images of the same place captured from different camera viewpoints: "the similarity of what overlaps can be dominated by the dissimilarity of what does not overlap". We address this by encoding and searching for "image segments" instead of the whole images. We propose to use open-set image segmentation to decompose an image into `meaningful' entities (i.e., things and stuff). This enables us to create a novel image representation as a collection of multiple overlapping subgraphs connecting a segment with its neighboring segments, dubbed SuperSegment. Furthermore, to efficiently encode these SuperSegments into compact vector representations, we propose a novel factorized representation of feature aggregation. We show that retrieving these partial representations leads to significantly higher recognition recall than the typical whole image based retrieval. Our segments-based approach, dubbed SegVLAD, sets a new state-of-the-art in place recognition on a diverse selection of benchmark datasets, while being applicable to both generic and task-specialized image encoders. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our method to ``revisit anything'' by evaluating our method on an object instance retrieval task, which bridges the two disparate areas of research: visual place recognition and object-goal navigation, through their common aim of recognizing goal objects specific to a place.

      <title>DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement. We make code and benchmarks publicly available.</description>

      <title>Visual Data Diagnosis and Debiasing with Concept Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity. However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions. Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we present CONBIAS, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets. CONBIAS represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset. Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by CONBIAS improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make our code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>FreeEdit: Mask-free Reference-based Image Editing with Multi-modal Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing user-specified visual concepts in image editing is highly practical as these concepts convey the user's intent more precisely than text-based descriptions. We propose FreeEdit, a novel approach for achieving such reference-based image editing, which can accurately reproduce the visual concept from the reference image based on user-friendly language instructions. Our approach leverages the multi-modal instruction encoder to encode language instructions to guide the editing process. This implicit way of locating the editing area eliminates the need for manual editing masks. To enhance the reconstruction of reference details, we introduce the Decoupled Residual ReferAttention (DRRA) module. This module is designed to integrate fine-grained reference features extracted by a detail extractor into the image editing process in a residual way without interfering with the original self-attention. Given that existing datasets are unsuitable for reference-based image editing tasks, particularly due to the difficulty in constructing image triplets that include a reference image, we curate a high-quality dataset, FreeBench, using a newly developed twice-repainting scheme. FreeBench comprises the images before and after editing, detailed editing instructions, as well as a reference image that maintains the identity of the edited object, encompassing tasks such as object addition, replacement, and deletion. By conducting phased training on FreeBench followed by quality tuning, FreeEdit achieves high-quality zero-shot editing through convenient language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of FreeEdit across multiple task types, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. The code will be available at: https://freeedit.github.io/.</description>

      <title>SKT: Integrating State-Aware Keypoint Trajectories with Vision-Language Models for Robotic Garment Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating garment manipulation poses a significant challenge for assistive robotics due to the diverse and deformable nature of garments. Traditional approaches typically require separate models for each garment type, which limits scalability and adaptability. In contrast, this paper presents a unified approach using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve keypoint prediction across various garment categories. By interpreting both visual and semantic information, our model enables robots to manage different garment states with a single model. We created a large-scale synthetic dataset using advanced simulation techniques, allowing scalable training without extensive real-world data. Experimental results indicate that the VLM-based method significantly enhances keypoint detection accuracy and task success rates, providing a more flexible and general solution for robotic garment manipulation. In addition, this research also underscores the potential of VLMs to unify various garment manipulation tasks within a single framework, paving the way for broader applications in home automation and assistive robotics for future.</description>

      <title>GSON: A Group-based Social Navigation Framework with Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of service robots and autonomous vehicles in human-centered environments grows, their requirements go beyond simply navigating to a destination. They must also take into account dynamic social contexts and ensure respect and comfort for others in shared spaces, which poses significant challenges for perception and planning. In this paper, we present a group-based social navigation framework GSON to enable mobile robots to perceive and exploit the social group of their surroundings by leveling the visual reasoning capability of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM). For perception, we apply visual prompting techniques to zero-shot extract the social relationship among pedestrians and combine the result with a robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipeline to alleviate the problem of low inference speed of the LMM. Given the perception result, the planning system is designed to avoid disrupting the current social structure. We adopt a social structure-based mid-level planner as a bridge between global path planning and local motion planning to preserve the global context and reactive response. The proposed method is validated on real-world mobile robot navigation tasks involving complex social structure understanding and reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in these scenarios compared with several baselines.</description>

      <title>DiffSSC: Semantic LiDAR Scan Completion using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets and our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for SSC.</description>

      <title>EfficientCrackNet: A Lightweight Model for Crack Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crack detection, particularly from pavement images, presents a formidable challenge in the domain of computer vision due to several inherent complexities such as intensity inhomogeneity, intricate topologies, low contrast, and noisy backgrounds. Automated crack detection is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of essential infrastructures, including buildings, pavements, and bridges. Existing lightweight methods often face challenges including computational inefficiency, complex crack patterns, and difficult backgrounds, leading to inaccurate detection and impracticality for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose EfficientCrackNet, a lightweight hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers for precise crack segmentation. EfficientCrackNet integrates depthwise separable convolutions (DSC) layers and MobileViT block to capture both global and local features. The model employs an Edge Extraction Method (EEM) and for efficient crack edge detection without pretraining, and Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Module (ULSAM) to enhance feature extraction. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets Crack500, DeepCrack, and GAPs384 demonstrate that EfficientCrackNet achieves superior performance compared to existing lightweight models, while requiring only 0.26M parameters, and 0.483 FLOPs (G). The proposed model offers an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art lightweight models, and providing a robust and adaptable solution for real-world crack segmentation.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) is set to transform satellite Assembly, Integration, and Testing (AIT) processes by enhancing precision, minimizing human error, and improving operational efficiency in cleanroom environments. This paper presents a technical description of the European Space Agency's (ESA) project "AI for AR in Satellite AIT," which combines real-time computer vision and AR systems to assist technicians during satellite assembly. Leveraging Microsoft HoloLens 2 as the AR interface, the system delivers context-aware instructions and real-time feedback, tackling the complexities of object recognition and 6D pose estimation in AIT workflows. All AI models demonstrated over 70% accuracy, with the detection model exceeding 95% accuracy, indicating a high level of performance and reliability. A key contribution of this work lies in the effective use of synthetic data for training AI models in AR applications, addressing the significant challenges of obtaining real-world datasets in highly dynamic satellite environments, as well as the creation of the Segmented Anything Model for Automatic Labelling (SAMAL), which facilitates the automatic annotation of real data, achieving speeds up to 20 times faster than manual human annotation. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of AI-driven AR systems in automating critical satellite assembly tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in the space industry.</description>

      <title>Find Rhinos without Finding Rhinos: Active Learning with Multimodal Imagery of South African Rhino Habitats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of Earth's charismatic megafauna is endangered by human activities, particularly the rhino, which is at risk of extinction due to the poaching crisis in Africa. Monitoring rhinos' movement is crucial to their protection but has unfortunately proven difficult because rhinos are elusive. Therefore, instead of tracking rhinos, we propose the novel approach of mapping communal defecation sites, called middens, which give information about rhinos' spatial behavior valuable to anti-poaching, management, and reintroduction efforts. This paper provides the first-ever mapping of rhino midden locations by building classifiers to detect them using remotely sensed thermal, RGB, and LiDAR imagery in passive and active learning settings. As existing active learning methods perform poorly due to the extreme class imbalance in our dataset, we design MultimodAL, an active learning system employing a ranking technique and multimodality to achieve competitive performance with passive learning models with 94% fewer labels. Our methods could therefore save over 76 hours in labeling time when used on a similarly-sized dataset. Unexpectedly, our midden map reveals that rhino middens are not randomly distributed throughout the landscape; rather, they are clustered. Consequently, rangers should be targeted at areas with high midden densities to strengthen anti-poaching efforts, in line with UN Target 15.7.</description>

      <title>Multi-View and Multi-Scale Alignment for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training in Mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) shows promise in medical image analysis but requires substantial data and computational resources. Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.</description>

Abstract: With the world population rapidly increasing, transforming our agrifood systems to be more productive, efficient, safe, and sustainable is crucial to mitigate potential food shortages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) have demonstrated their strong abilities in various areas, including language, vision, remote sensing (RS), and agrifood systems applications. However, the overall impact of AI on agrifood systems remains unclear. In this paper, we thoroughly review how AI techniques can transform agrifood systems and contribute to the modern agrifood industry. Firstly, we summarize the data acquisition methods in agrifood systems, including acquisition, storage, and processing techniques. Secondly, we present a progress review of AI methods in agrifood systems, specifically in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, covering topics such as agrifood classification, growth monitoring, yield prediction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and promising research opportunities for transforming modern agrifood systems with AI. We hope this survey could offer an overall picture to newcomers in the field and serve as a starting point for their further research.

      <title>Time and State Dependent Neural Delay Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuities and delayed terms are encountered in the governing equations of a large class of problems ranging from physics and engineering to medicine and economics. These systems cannot be properly modelled and simulated with standard Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), or data-driven approximations such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). To circumvent this issue, latent variables are typically introduced to solve the dynamics of the system in a higher dimensional space and obtain the solution as a projection to the original space. However, this solution lacks physical interpretability. In contrast, Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), and their data-driven approximated counterparts, naturally appear as good candidates to characterize such systems. In this work we revisit the recently proposed Neural DDE by introducing Neural State-Dependent DDE (SDDDE), a general and flexible framework that can model multiple and state- and time-dependent delays. We show that our method is competitive and outperforms other continuous-class models on a wide variety of delayed dynamical systems. Code is available at the repository \href{https://github.com/thibmonsel/Time-and-State-Dependent-Neural-Delay-Differential-Equations}{here}.</description>

      <title>Discrete, compositional, and symbolic representations through attractor dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic systems are powerful frameworks for modeling cognitive processes as they encapsulate the rules and relationships fundamental to many aspects of human reasoning and behavior. Central to these models are systematicity, compositionality, and productivity, making them invaluable in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. However, certain limitations remain. For instance, the integration of structured symbolic processes and latent sub-symbolic processes has been implemented at the computational level through fiat methods such as quantization or softmax sampling, which assume, rather than derive, the operations underpinning discretization and symbolicization. In this work, we introduce a novel neural stochastic dynamical systems model that integrates attractor dynamics with symbolic representations to model cognitive processes akin to the probabilistic language of thought (PLoT). Our model segments the continuous representational space into discrete basins, with attractor states corresponding to symbolic sequences, that reflect the semanticity and compositionality characteristic of symbolic systems through unsupervised learning, rather than relying on pre-defined primitives. Moreover, like PLoT, our model learns to sample a diverse distribution of attractor states that reflect the mutual information between the input data and the symbolic encodings. This approach establishes a unified framework that integrates both symbolic and sub-symbolic processing through neural dynamics, a neuro-plausible substrate with proven expressivity in AI, offering a more comprehensive model that mirrors the complex duality of cognitive operations.</description>

      <title>ZSC-Eval: An Evaluation Toolkit and Benchmark for Multi-agent Zero-shot Coordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a new cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) challenge that aims to train an ego agent to work with diverse, unseen partners during deployment. The significant difference between the deployment-time partners' distribution and the training partners' distribution determined by the training algorithm makes ZSC a unique out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge. The potential distribution gap between evaluation and deployment-time partners leads to inadequate evaluation, which is exacerbated by the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics. In this paper, we present ZSC-Eval, the first evaluation toolkit and benchmark for ZSC algorithms. ZSC-Eval consists of: 1) Generation of evaluation partner candidates through behavior-preferring rewards to approximate deployment-time partners' distribution; 2) Selection of evaluation partners by Best-Response Diversity (BR-Div); 3) Measurement of generalization performance with various evaluation partners via the Best-Response Proximity (BR-Prox) metric. We use ZSC-Eval to benchmark ZSC algorithms in Overcooked and Google Research Football environments and get novel empirical findings. We also conduct a human experiment of current ZSC algorithms to verify the ZSC-Eval's consistency with human evaluation. ZSC-Eval is now available at https://github.com/sjtu-marl/ZSC-Eval.</description>

Abstract: Generative models trained on internet data have revolutionized how text, image, and video content can be created. Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich along different dimensions (e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in robotics data, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, we can simulate the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as "open the drawer" and low-level controls from otherwise static scenes and objects. We use the simulator to train both high-level vision-language policies and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which can be deployed in the real world in zero shot after training purely in simulation. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience, opening up even wider applications. Video demos can be found at https://universal-simulator.github.io.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Integration Brings Causal and Reliable Reasoning Proofs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two lines of approaches are adopted for complex reasoning with LLMs. One line of work prompts LLMs with various reasoning structures, while the structural outputs can be naturally regarded as intermediate reasoning steps. Another line of work adopt LLM-free declarative solvers to do the reasoning task, rendering higher reasoning accuracy but lacking interpretability due to the black-box nature of the solvers. Aiming to resolve the trade-off between answer accuracy and interpretability, we present a simple extension to the latter line of work. Specifically, we showcase that the intermediate search logs generated by Prolog interpreters can be accessed and interpreted into human-readable reasoning proofs. As long as LLMs correctly translate problem descriptions into Prolog representations, the corresponding reasoning proofs are ensured to be causal and reliable. On two logical reasoning and one arithmetic reasoning datasets, our framework obtains significant improvements in terms of both answer accuracy and reasoning proof accuracy.

      <title>Distributional Latent Variable Models with an Application in Active Cognitive Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive modeling commonly relies on asking participants to complete a battery of varied tests in order to estimate attention, working memory, and other latent variables. In many cases, these tests result in highly variable observation models. A near-ubiquitous approach is to repeat many observations for each test independently, resulting in a distribution over the outcomes from each test given to each subject. Latent variable models (LVMs), if employed, are only added after data collection. In this paper, we explore the usage of LVMs to enable learning across many correlated variables simultaneously. We extend LVMs to the setting where observed data for each subject are a series of observations from many different distributions, rather than simple vectors to be reconstructed. By embedding test battery results for individuals in a latent space that is trained jointly across a population, we can leverage correlations both between disparate test data for a single participant and between multiple participants. We then propose an active learning framework that leverages this model to conduct more efficient cognitive test batteries. We validate our approach by demonstrating with real-time data acquisition that it performs comparably to conventional methods in making item-level predictions with fewer test items.</description>

      <title>Augmented neural forms with parametric boundary-matching operators for solving ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations constitutes a significant challenge. Based on functional expressions that inherently depend on neural networks, neural forms are specifically designed to precisely satisfy the prescribed initial or boundary conditions of the problem, while providing the approximate solutions in closed form. Departing from the important class of ordinary differential equations, the present work aims to refine and validate the neural forms methodology, paving the ground for further developments in more challenging fields. The main contributions are as follows. First, it introduces a formalism for systematically crafting proper neural forms with adaptable boundary matches that are amenable to optimization. Second, it describes a novel technique for converting problems with Neumann or Robin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions. Third, it outlines a method for determining an upper bound on the absolute deviation from the exact solution. The proposed augmented neural forms approach was tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first- and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff differential equations have been considered as well. The resulting solutions were subjected to assessment against existing exact solutions, solutions derived through the common penalized neural method, and solutions obtained via contemporary numerical analysis methods. The reported results demonstrate that the augmented neural forms not only satisfy the boundary and initial conditions exactly, but also provide closed-form solutions that facilitate high-quality interpolation and controllable overall precision. These attributes are essential for expanding the application field of neural forms to more challenging problems that are described by partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>SeCoKD: Aligning Large Language Models for In-Context Learning with Fewer Shots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that demonstrations can significantly help Large Language Models (LLMs ) perform better on the given tasks. However, this so-called In-Context Learning ( ICL ) ability is very sensitive to the presenting context, and often dozens of demonstrations are needed. In this work, we investigate if we can reduce the shot number while still maintaining a competitive performance. We present SeCoKD, a self-Knowledge Distillation ( KD ) training framework that aligns the student model with a heavily prompted variation, thereby increasing the utilization of a single demonstration. We experiment with the SeCoKD across three LLMs and six benchmarks focusing mainly on reasoning tasks. Results show that our method outperforms the base model and Supervised Fine-tuning ( SFT ), especially in zero-shot and one-shot settings by 30% and 10%, respectively. Moreover, SeCoKD brings little negative artifacts when evaluated on new tasks, which is more robust than Supervised Fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without needing expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods with divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the divide or the conquer procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model for Mechanical System Configuration Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI has made remarkable progress in addressing various design challenges. One prominent area where generative AI could bring significant value is in engineering design. In particular, selecting an optimal set of components and their interfaces to create a mechanical system that meets design requirements is one of the most challenging and time-consuming tasks for engineers. This configuration design task is inherently challenging due to its categorical nature, multiple design requirements a solution must satisfy, and the reliance on physics simulations for evaluating potential solutions. These characteristics entail solving a combinatorial optimization problem with multiple constraints involving black-box functions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep generative model to predict the optimal combination of components and interfaces for a given design problem. To demonstrate our approach, we solve a gear train synthesis problem by first creating a synthetic dataset using a grammar, a parts catalogue, and a physics simulator. We then train a Transformer using this dataset, named GearFormer, which can not only generate quality solutions on its own, but also augment search methods such as an evolutionary algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search. We show that GearFormer outperforms such search methods on their own in terms of satisfying the specified design requirements with orders of magnitude faster generation time. Additionally, we showcase the benefit of hybrid methods that leverage both GearFormer and search methods, which further improve the quality of the solutions.</description>

      <title>In-Context Ensemble Improves Video-Language Models for Low-Level Workflow Understanding from Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines a low-level, step-by-step written guide for a business software workflow based on a video demonstration. SOPs are a crucial step toward automating end-to-end software workflows. Manually creating SOPs can be time-consuming. Recent advancements in large video-language models offer the potential for automating SOP generation by analyzing recordings of human demonstrations. However, current large video-language models face challenges with zero-shot SOP generation. We explore in-context learning with video-language models for SOP generation. We report that in-context learning sometimes helps video-language models at SOP generation. We then propose an in-context ensemble learning to further enhance the capabilities of the models in SOP generation.</description>

      <title>HAICOSYSTEM: An Ecosystem for Sandboxing Safety Risks in Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly autonomous in their interactions with human users and tools, leading to increased interactional safety risks. We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50\% cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.</description>

      <title>AI-driven View Guidance System in Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) is a crucial imaging modality used in electrophysiology (EP) and structural heart disease (SHD) interventions, providing real-time, high-resolution views from within the heart. Despite its advantages, effective manipulation of the ICE catheter requires significant expertise, which can lead to inconsistent outcomes, particularly among less experienced operators. To address this challenge, we propose an AI-driven closed-loop view guidance system with human-in-the-loop feedback, designed to assist users in navigating ICE imaging without requiring specialized knowledge. Our method models the relative position and orientation vectors between arbitrary views and clinically defined ICE views in a spatial coordinate system, guiding users on how to manipulate the ICE catheter to transition from the current view to the desired view over time. Operating in a closed-loop configuration, the system continuously predicts and updates the necessary catheter manipulations, ensuring seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through a simulation-based evaluation, achieving an 89% success rate with the 6532 test dataset, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ICE imaging procedures.</description>

      <title>Unsupervisedly Learned Representations: Should the Quest be Over?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.07495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After four decades of research there still exists a Classification accuracy gap of about 20% between our best Unsupervisedly Learned Representations methods and the accuracy rates achieved by intelligent animals. It thus may well be that we are looking in the wrong direction. A possible solution to this puzzle is presented. We demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning can learn representations which achieve the same accuracy as that of animals. Our main modest contribution lies in the observations that: a. when applied to a real world environment Reinforcement Learning does not require labels, and thus may be legitimately considered as Unsupervised Learning, and b. in contrast, when Reinforcement Learning is applied in a simulated environment it does inherently require labels and should thus be generally be considered as Supervised Learning. The corollary of these observations is that further search for Unsupervised Learning competitive paradigms which may be trained in simulated environments may be futile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training visual and textual representations from large-scale image-text pairs is becoming a standard approach for many downstream vision-language tasks. The transformer-based models learn inter and intra-modal attention through a list of self-supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes LAViTeR, a novel architecture for visual and textual representation learning. The main module, Visual Textual Alignment (VTA) will be assisted by two auxiliary tasks, GAN-based image synthesis and Image Captioning. We also propose a new evaluation metric measuring the similarity between the learnt visual and textual embedding. The experimental results on two public datasets, CUB and MS-COCO, demonstrate superior visual and textual representation alignment in the joint feature embedding space</description>

      <title>IDP-PGFE: An Interpretable Disruption Predictor based on Physics-Guided Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disruption prediction has made rapid progress in recent years, especially in machine learning (ML)-based methods. Understanding why a predictor makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy for future tokamak disruption predictors. The purpose of most disruption predictors is accuracy or cross-machine capability. However, if a disruption prediction model can be interpreted, it can tell why certain samples are classified as disruption precursors. This allows us to tell the types of incoming disruption and gives us insight into the mechanism of disruption. This paper designs a disruption predictor called Interpretable Disruption Predictor based On Physics-guided feature extraction (IDP-PGFE) on J-TEXT. The prediction performance of the model is effectively improved by extracting physics-guided features. A high-performance model is required to ensure the validity of the interpretation results. The interpretability study of IDP-PGFE provides an understanding of J-TEXT disruption and is generally consistent with existing comprehension of disruption. IDP-PGFE has been applied to the disruption due to continuously increasing density towards density limit experiments on J-TEXT. The time evolution of the PGFE features contribution demonstrates that the application of ECRH triggers radiation-caused disruption, which lowers the density at disruption. While the application of RMP indeed raises the density limit in J-TEXT. The interpretability study guides intuition on the physical mechanisms of density limit disruption that RMPs affect not only the MHD instabilities but also the radiation profile, which delays density limit disruption.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Decomposition and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sole aim of this book is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in Bayesian matrix decomposition in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning Bayesian matrix decomposition and given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of variational inference for conducting the optimization. We refer the reader to literature in the field of Bayesian analysis for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.
  This book is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important Bayesian matrix decomposition methods, e.g., real-valued decomposition, nonnegative matrix factorization, Bayesian interpolative decomposition, and the origin and complexity of the methods which shed light on their applications. The mathematical prerequisite is a first course in statistics and linear algebra. Other than this modest background, the development is self-contained, with rigorous proof provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Alternative Telescopic Displacement: An Efficient Multimodal Alignment Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of multimodal data integration, feature alignment plays a pivotal role. This paper introduces an innovative approach to feature alignment that revolutionizes the fusion of multimodal information. Our method employs a novel iterative process of telescopic displacement and expansion of feature representations across different modalities, culminating in a coherent unified representation within a shared feature space. This sophisticated technique demonstrates a remarkable ability to capture and leverage complex crossmodal interactions at the highest levels of abstraction. As a result, we observe significant enhancements in the performance of multimodal learning tasks. Through rigorous comparative analysis, we establish the superiority of our approach over existing multimodal fusion paradigms across a diverse array of applications. Comprehensive empirical evaluations conducted on multifaceted datasets encompassing temporal sequences, visual data, and textual information provide compelling evidence that our method achieves unprecedented benchmarks in the field. This work not only advances the state of the art in multimodal learning but also opens new avenues for exploring the synergies between disparate data modalities in complex analytical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning to Receive Help: Intervention-Aware Concept Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the opacity of neural architectures by constructing and explaining their predictions using a set of high-level concepts. A special property of these models is that they permit concept interventions, wherein users can correct mispredicted concepts and thus improve the model's performance. Recent work, however, has shown that intervention efficacy can be highly dependent on the order in which concepts are intervened on and on the model's architecture and training hyperparameters. We argue that this is rooted in a CBM's lack of train-time incentives for the model to be appropriately receptive to concept interventions. To address this, we propose Intervention-aware Concept Embedding models (IntCEMs), a novel CBM-based architecture and training paradigm that improves a model's receptiveness to test-time interventions. Our model learns a concept intervention policy in an end-to-end fashion from where it can sample meaningful intervention trajectories at train-time. This conditions IntCEMs to effectively select and receive concept interventions when deployed at test-time. Our experiments show that IntCEMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art concept-interpretable models when provided with test-time concept interventions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Serving Deep Learning Model in Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serving deep learning (DL) models on relational data has become a critical requirement across diverse commercial and scientific domains, sparking growing interest recently. In this visionary paper, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of representative architectures to address the requirement. We highlight three pivotal paradigms: The state-of-the-art DL-centric architecture offloads DL computations to dedicated DL frameworks. The potential UDF-centric architecture encapsulates one or more tensor computations into User Defined Functions (UDFs) within the relational database management system (RDBMS). The potential relation-centric architecture aims to represent a large-scale tensor computation through relational operators. While each of these architectures demonstrates promise in specific use scenarios, we identify urgent requirements for seamless integration of these architectures and the middle ground in-between these architectures. We delve into the gaps that impede the integration and explore innovative strategies to close them. We present a pathway to establish a novel RDBMS for enabling a broad class of data-intensive DL inference applications.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Error Modeling for Human Data Annotation: Evidence From an Industry-Scale Search Data Annotation Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems rely heavily on human-annotated data for training and evaluation. A major challenge in this context is the occurrence of annotation errors, as their effects can degrade model performance. This paper presents a predictive error model trained to detect potential errors in search relevance annotation tasks for three industry-scale ML applications (music streaming, video streaming, and mobile apps). Drawing on real-world data from an extensive search relevance annotation program, we demonstrate that errors can be predicted with moderate model performance (AUC=0.65-0.75) and that model performance generalizes well across applications (i.e., a global, task-agnostic model performs on par with task-specific models). In contrast to past research, which has often focused on predicting annotation labels from task-specific features, our model is trained to predict errors directly from a combination of task features and behavioral features derived from the annotation process, in order to achieve a high degree of generalizability. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model in the context of auditing, where prioritizing tasks with high predicted error probabilities considerably increases the amount of corrected annotation errors (e.g., 40% efficiency gains for the music streaming application). These results highlight that behavioral error detection models can yield considerable improvements in the efficiency and quality of data annotation processes. Our findings reveal critical insights into effective error management in the data annotation process, thereby contributing to the broader field of human-in-the-loop ML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-objective reinforcement learning with nonlinear preferences over trajectories. That is, we maximize the expected value of a nonlinear function over accumulated rewards (expected scalarized return or ESR) in a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). We derive an extended form of Bellman optimality for nonlinear optimization that explicitly considers time and current accumulated reward. Using this formulation, we describe an approximation algorithm for computing an approximately optimal non-stationary policy in pseudopolynomial time for smooth scalarization functions with a constant number of rewards. We prove the approximation analytically and demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, showing that there can be a substantial gap between the optimal policy computed by our algorithm and alternative baselines.</description>

      <title>Ego-Exo4D: Understanding Skilled Human Activity from First- and Third-Person Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Ego-Exo4D, a diverse, large-scale multimodal multiview video dataset and benchmark challenge. Ego-Exo4D centers around simultaneously-captured egocentric and exocentric video of skilled human activities (e.g., sports, music, dance, bike repair). 740 participants from 13 cities worldwide performed these activities in 123 different natural scene contexts, yielding long-form captures from 1 to 42 minutes each and 1,286 hours of video combined. The multimodal nature of the dataset is unprecedented: the video is accompanied by multichannel audio, eye gaze, 3D point clouds, camera poses, IMU, and multiple paired language descriptions -- including a novel "expert commentary" done by coaches and teachers and tailored to the skilled-activity domain. To push the frontier of first-person video understanding of skilled human activity, we also present a suite of benchmark tasks and their annotations, including fine-grained activity understanding, proficiency estimation, cross-view translation, and 3D hand/body pose. All resources are open sourced to fuel new research in the community. Project page: http://ego-exo4d-data.org/</description>

      <title>Fixed-length Dense Descriptor for Efficient Fingerprint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18576v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fingerprint matching, fixed-length descriptors generally offer greater efficiency compared to minutiae set, but the recognition accuracy is not as good as that of the latter. Although much progress has been made in deep learning based fixed-length descriptors recently, they often fall short when dealing with incomplete or partial fingerprints, diverse fingerprint poses, and significant background noise. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional representation called Fixed-length Dense Descriptor (FDD) for efficient fingerprint matching. FDD features great spatial properties, enabling it to capture the spatial relationships of the original fingerprints, thereby enhancing interpretability and robustness. Our experiments on various fingerprint datasets reveal that FDD outperforms other fixed-length descriptors, especially in matching fingerprints of different areas, cross-modal fingerprint matching, and fingerprint matching with background noise.</description>

      <title>Tenplex: Dynamic Parallelism for Deep Learning using Parallelizable Tensor Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) jobs use multi-dimensional parallelism, i.e. combining data, model, and pipeline parallelism, to use large GPU clusters efficiently. Long-running jobs may experience changes to their GPU allocation: (i) resource elasticity during training adds or removes GPUs; (ii) hardware maintenance may require redeployment on different GPUs; and (iii) GPU failures force jobs to run with fewer devices. Current DL frameworks tie jobs to a set of GPUs and thus lack support for these scenarios. In particular, they cannot change the multi-dimensional parallelism of an already-running job in an efficient and model-independent way.
  We describe Scalai, a state management library for DL systems that enables jobs to change their parallelism dynamically after the GPU allocation is updated at runtime. Scalai achieves this through a new abstraction, a parallelizable tensor collection (PTC), that externalizes the job state during training. After a GPU change, Scalai uses the PTC to transform the job state: the PTC repartitions the dataset state under data parallelism and exposes it to DL workers through a virtual file system; and the PTC obtains the model state as partitioned checkpoints and transforms them to reflect the new parallelization configuration. For efficiency, Scalai executes PTC transformations in parallel with minimum data movement between workers. Our experiments show that Scalai enables DL jobs to support dynamic parallelization with low overhead.</description>

      <title>TaskMet: Task-Driven Metric Learning for Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are often deployed in downstream tasks that the training procedure may not be aware of. For example, models solely trained to achieve accurate predictions may struggle to perform well on downstream tasks because seemingly small prediction errors may incur drastic task errors. The standard end-to-end learning approach is to make the task loss differentiable or to introduce a differentiable surrogate that the model can be trained on. In these settings, the task loss needs to be carefully balanced with the prediction loss because they may have conflicting objectives. We propose take the task loss signal one level deeper than the parameters of the model and use it to learn the parameters of the loss function the model is trained on, which can be done by learning a metric in the prediction space. This approach does not alter the optimal prediction model itself, but rather changes the model learning to emphasize the information important for the downstream task. This enables us to achieve the best of both worlds: a prediction model trained in the original prediction space while also being valuable for the desired downstream task. We validate our approach through experiments conducted in two main settings: 1) decision-focused model learning scenarios involving portfolio optimization and budget allocation, and 2) reinforcement learning in noisy environments with distracting states.

      <description>arXiv:2312.14115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LingoQA, a novel dataset and benchmark for visual question answering in autonomous driving. The dataset contains 28K unique short video scenarios, and 419K annotations. Evaluating state-of-the-art vision-language models on our benchmark shows that their performance is below human capabilities, with GPT-4V responding truthfully to 59.6% of the questions compared to 96.6% for humans. For evaluation, we propose a truthfulness classifier, called Lingo-Judge, that achieves a 0.95 Spearman correlation coefficient to human evaluations, surpassing existing techniques like METEOR, BLEU, CIDEr, and GPT-4. We establish a baseline vision-language model and run extensive ablation studies to understand its performance. We release our dataset and benchmark as an evaluation platform for vision-language models in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>TypeFly: Flying Drones with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robot control using large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential, primarily due to LLMs' capabilities to understand natural language commands and generate executable plans in various languages. However, in real-time and interactive applications involving mobile robots, particularly drones, the sequential token generation process inherent to LLMs introduces substantial latency, i.e. response time, in control plan generation.
  In this paper, we present a system called ChatFly that tackles this problem using a combination of a novel programming language called MiniSpec and its runtime to reduce the plan generation time and drone response time. That is, instead of asking an LLM to write a program (robotic plan) in the popular but verbose Python, ChatFly gets it to do it in MiniSpec specially designed for token efficiency and stream interpretation. Using a set of challenging drone tasks, we show that design choices made by ChatFly can reduce up to 62% response time and provide a more consistent user experience, enabling responsive and intelligent LLM-based drone control with efficient completion.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling Through The Reuse Of Attention Maps In Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for flexible and realistic image synthesis. Nevertheless, these models rely on a time-consuming sampling procedure, which has motivated attempts to reduce their latency. When improving efficiency, researchers often use the original diffusion model to train an additional network designed specifically for fast image generation. In contrast, our approach seeks to reduce latency directly, without any retraining, fine-tuning, or knowledge distillation. In particular, we find the repeated calculation of attention maps to be costly yet redundant, and instead suggest reusing them during sampling. Our specific reuse strategies are based on ODE theory, which implies that the later a map is reused, the smaller the distortion in the final image. We empirically compare these reuse strategies with few-step sampling procedures of comparable latency, finding that reuse generates images that are closer to those produced by the original high-latency diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Model-Based Optimization via Source Critic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization seeks to optimize against a learned surrogate model without querying the true oracle objective function during optimization. Such tasks are commonly encountered in protein design, robotics, and clinical medicine where evaluating the oracle function is prohibitively expensive. However, inaccurate surrogate model predictions are frequently encountered along offline optimization trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose generative adversarial model-based optimization using adaptive source critic regularization (aSCR) -- a task- and optimizer- agnostic framework for constraining the optimization trajectory to regions of the design space where the surrogate function is reliable. We propose a computationally tractable algorithm to dynamically adjust the strength of this constraint, and show how leveraging aSCR with standard Bayesian optimization outperforms existing methods on a suite of offline generative design tasks.

      <title>An Empirical Study on Cross-lingual Vocabulary Adaptation for Efficient Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art generative large language models (LLMs) disproportionately relies on English-centric tokenizers, vocabulary and pre-training data. Despite the fact that some LLMs have multilingual capabilities, recent studies have shown that their inference efficiency deteriorates when generating text in languages other than English. This results in increased inference time and costs. Cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation (CVA) methods have been proposed for adapting models to a target language aiming to improve downstream performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods on increasing inference efficiency of generative LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of five CVA methods on four generative LLMs (including monolingual and multilingual models) across four typologically-diverse languages and four natural language understanding tasks. We find that CVA substantially contributes to LLM inference speedups of up to 271.5\%. We also show that adapting LLMs that have been pre-trained on more balanced multilingual data results in downstream performance comparable to the original models.</description>

      <title>Image Denoising with Machine Learning: A Novel Approach to Improve Quantum Image Processing Quality and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Image Processing (QIP) is a field that aims to utilize the benefits of quantum computing for manipulating and analyzing images. However, QIP faces two challenges: the limitation of qubits and the presence of noise in a quantum machine. In this research, we propose a novel approach to address the issue of noise in QIP. By training and employing a machine learning model that identifies and corrects the noise in quantum-processed images, we can compensate for the noisiness caused by the machine and retrieve a processing result similar to that performed by a classical computer with higher efficiency. The model is trained by learning a dataset consisting of both existing processed images and quantum-processed images from open-access datasets. This model will be capable of providing us with the confidence level for each pixel and its potential original value. To assess the model's accuracy in compensating for loss and decoherence in QIP, we evaluate it using three metrics: Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Additionally, we discuss the applicability of our model across domains well as its cost effectiveness compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current societal challenges exceed the capacity of humans operating either alone or collectively. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives will vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, together, can surpass the collective intelligence of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from complex network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence and analyze real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by considering potential challenges and future developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has recently gained considerable attention due to its potential to achieve Safe AI by removing the influence of specific data from trained Machine Learning (ML) models. This process, known as knowledge removal, addresses AI governance concerns of training data such as quality, sensitivity, copyright restrictions, and obsolescence. This capability is also crucial for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as the Right To Be Forgotten (RTBF). Furthermore, effective knowledge removal mitigates the risk of harmful outcomes, safeguarding against biases, misinformation, and unauthorized data exploitation, thereby enhancing the safe and responsible use of AI systems. Efforts have been made to design efficient unlearning approaches, with MU services being examined for integration with existing machine learning as a service (MLaaS), allowing users to submit requests to remove specific data from the training corpus. However, recent research highlights vulnerabilities in machine unlearning systems, such as information leakage and malicious unlearning, that can lead to significant security and privacy concerns. Moreover, extensive research indicates that unlearning methods and prevalent attacks fulfill diverse roles within MU systems. This underscores the intricate relationship and complex interplay among these mechanisms in maintaining system functionality and safety. This survey aims to fill the gap between the extensive number of studies on threats, attacks, and defenses in machine unlearning and the absence of a comprehensive review that categorizes their taxonomy, methods, and solutions, thus offering valuable insights for future research directions and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>SliceIt! -- A Dual Simulator Framework for Learning Robot Food Slicing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooking robots can enhance the home experience by reducing the burden of daily chores. However, these robots must perform their tasks dexterously and safely in shared human environments, especially when handling dangerous tools such as kitchen knives. This study focuses on enabling a robot to autonomously and safely learn food-cutting tasks. More specifically, our goal is to enable a collaborative robot or industrial robot arm to perform food-slicing tasks by adapting to varying material properties using compliance control. Our approach involves using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a robot to compliantly manipulate a knife, by reducing the contact forces exerted by the food items and by the cutting board. However, training the robot in the real world can be inefficient, and dangerous, and result in a lot of food waste. Therefore, we proposed SliceIt!, a framework for safely and efficiently learning robot food-slicing tasks in simulation. Following a real2sim2real approach, our framework consists of collecting a few real food slicing data, calibrating our dual simulation environment (a high-fidelity cutting simulator and a robotic simulator), learning compliant control policies on the calibrated simulation environment, and finally, deploying the policies on the real robot.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis: A Survey and New Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been increased interest in understanding the interplay between deep generative models (DGMs) and the manifold hypothesis. Research in this area focuses on understanding the reasons why commonly-used DGMs succeed or fail at learning distributions supported on unknown low-dimensional manifolds, as well as developing new models explicitly designed to account for manifold-supported data. This manifold lens provides both clarity as to why some DGMs (e.g. diffusion models and some generative adversarial networks) empirically surpass others (e.g. likelihood-based models such as variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, or energy-based models) at sample generation, and guidance for devising more performant DGMs. We carry out the first survey of DGMs viewed through this lens, making two novel contributions along the way. First, we formally establish that numerical instability of likelihoods in high ambient dimensions is unavoidable when modelling data with low intrinsic dimension. We then show that DGMs on learned representations of autoencoders can be interpreted as approximately minimizing Wasserstein distance: this result, which applies to latent diffusion models, helps justify their outstanding empirical results. The manifold lens provides a rich perspective from which to understand DGMs, and we aim to make this perspective more accessible and widespread.</description>

Abstract: The transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), is at the heart of the remarkable recent progress in the development of language models, including widely-used chatbots such as Chat-GPT and Claude. In this paper, I argue that we can extract from the way the transformer architecture works a theory of the relationship between context and meaning. I call this the transformer theory, and I argue that it is novel with regard to two related philosophical debates: the contextualism debate regarding the extent of context-sensitivity across natural language, and the polysemy debate regarding how polysemy should be captured within an account of word meaning.</description>

      <title>AutoScraper: A Progressive Understanding Web Agent for Web Scraper Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web scraping is a powerful technique that extracts data from websites, enabling automated data collection, enhancing data analysis capabilities, and minimizing manual data entry efforts. Existing methods, wrappers-based methods suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website, while language agents, empowered by large language models (LLMs), exhibit poor reusability in diverse web environments. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of generating web scrapers with LLMs and propose AutoScraper, a two-stage framework that can handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. AutoScraper leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML and similarity across different web pages for generating web scrapers. Besides, we propose a new executability metric for better measuring the performance of web scraper generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

      <description>arXiv:2405.06802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two fundamental problems in health-care stem from patient handoff and triage. Doctors are often required to perform complex findings summarization to facilitate efficient communication with specialists and decision making on the urgency of each case. To address these challenges, we present a state of the art radiology report summarization model utilizing adjusted bidirectional encoder representation from transformers BERTtoBERT encoder and decoder architecture. We also provide a data processing pipeline for future models developed on the the MIMIC CXR dataset. Our approach includes a novel method for augmenting medical data and a comprehensive performance analysis. Our best performing model achieved a recall oriented understudy for gisting evaluation L F1 score of 58.75/100, outperforming specialized checkpoints with more sophisticated attention mechanisms. We also provide a data processing pipeline for future models developed on the MIMIC chest X-ray dataset. The model introduced in this paper demonstrates significantly improved capacity in radiology report summarization, highlighting the potential for ensuring better clinical workflows and enhanced patient care.</description>

      <title>Automating Data Annotation under Strategic Human Agents: Risks and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in social domains to make consequential decisions about humans, they often have the power to reshape data distributions. Humans, as strategic agents, continuously adapt their behaviors in response to the learning system. As populations change dynamically, ML systems may need frequent updates to ensure high performance. However, acquiring high-quality human-annotated samples can be highly challenging and even infeasible in social domains. A common practice to address this issue is using the model itself to annotate unlabeled data samples. This paper investigates the long-term impacts when ML models are retrained with model-annotated samples when they incorporate human strategic responses. We first formalize the interactions between strategic agents and the model and then analyze how they evolve under such dynamic interactions. We find that agents are increasingly likely to receive positive decisions as the model gets retrained, whereas the proportion of agents with positive labels may decrease over time. We thus propose a refined retraining process to stabilize the dynamics. Last, we examine how algorithmic fairness can be affected by these retraining processes and find that enforcing common fairness constraints at every round may not benefit the disadvantaged group in the long run. Experiments on (semi-)synthetic and real data validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Visual Prompt Tuning in Null Space for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing prompt-tuning methods have demonstrated impressive performances in continual learning (CL), by selecting and updating relevant prompts in the vision-transformer models. On the contrary, this paper aims to learn each task by tuning the prompts in the direction orthogonal to the subspace spanned by previous tasks' features, so as to ensure no interference on tasks that have been learned to overcome catastrophic forgetting in CL. However, different from the orthogonal projection in the traditional CNN architecture, the prompt gradient orthogonal projection in the ViT architecture shows completely different and greater challenges, i.e., 1) the high-order and non-linear self-attention operation; 2) the drift of prompt distribution brought by the LayerNorm in the transformer block. Theoretically, we have finally deduced two consistency conditions to achieve the prompt gradient orthogonal projection, which provide a theoretical guarantee of eliminating interference on previously learned knowledge via the self-attention mechanism in visual prompt tuning. In practice, an effective null-space-based approximation solution has been proposed to implement the prompt gradient orthogonal projection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-forgetting on four class-incremental benchmarks with diverse pre-trained baseline models, and our approach achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>AsyncDiff: Parallelizing Diffusion Models by Asynchronous Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have garnered significant interest from the community for their great generative ability across various applications. However, their typical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative latency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To address this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play acceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our approach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple components, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain between these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising into an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden states in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is facilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy significantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the generative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff achieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with only a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs. Our experiments also demonstrate that AsyncDiff can be readily applied to video diffusion models with encouraging performances. The code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/AsyncDiff.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Time: Unsupervised Discovery and Isolation of Anomalous Behavior in Bio-regenerative Life Support System Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of abnormal or critical system states is essential in condition monitoring. While much attention is given to promptly identifying anomalies, a retrospective analysis of these anomalies can significantly enhance our comprehension of the underlying causes of observed undesired behavior. This aspect becomes particularly critical when the monitored system is deployed in a vital environment. In this study, we delve into anomalies within the domain of Bio-Regenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) for space exploration and analyze anomalies found in telemetry data stemming from the EDEN ISS space greenhouse in Antarctica. We employ time series clustering on anomaly detection results to categorize various types of anomalies in both uni- and multivariate settings. We then assess the effectiveness of these methods in identifying systematic anomalous behavior. Additionally, we illustrate that the anomaly detection methods MDI and DAMP produce complementary results, as previously indicated by research.</description>

      <title>Unused information in token probability distribution of generative LLM: improving LLM reading comprehension through calculation of expected values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM text decoding is key component for perceived LLM quality. We demonstrate two experiments showing that decoding methods could be improved by manipulation of token probabilities. First, we test few LLM on SummEval summary scoring dataset, to measure reading comprehension. We compare scores from greedy decoding to expected values over the next token distribution. We scale logits by large temperature to increase the entropy of scores. This allows strong improvement of performance on SummEval (in terms of correlations to human judgement). We see improvement from 6-8% to 13-28% for 7B Mistral and from 20%-46% to 37%-56% for Mixtral, beating GPT 4 0314 result on two metrics. Part of the gain seems related to positional bias. Secondly, we use probability-based tree sampling algorithm, to examine all most probable generations for given prompt.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Locality to Boost Sample Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the high cost of collecting robotic data in the real world, sample efficiency is a consistently compelling pursuit in robotics. In this paper, we introduce SGRv2, an imitation learning framework that enhances sample efficiency through improved visual and action representations. Central to the design of SGRv2 is the incorporation of a critical inductive bias-action locality, which posits that robot's actions are predominantly influenced by the target object and its interactions with the local environment. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that action locality is essential for boosting sample efficiency. SGRv2 excels in RLBench tasks with keyframe control using merely 5 demonstrations and surpasses the RVT baseline in 23 of 26 tasks. Furthermore, when evaluated on ManiSkill2 and MimicGen using dense control, SGRv2's success rate is 2.54 times that of SGR. In real-world environments, with only eight demonstrations, SGRv2 can perform a variety of tasks at a markedly higher success rate compared to baseline models.

      <title>Abstraction-of-Thought Makes Language Models Better Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract reasoning, the ability to reason from the abstract essence of a problem, serves as a key to generalization in human reasoning. However, eliciting language models to perform reasoning with abstraction remains unexplored. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by introducing a novel structured reasoning format called Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT). The uniqueness of AoT lies in its explicit requirement for varying levels of abstraction within the reasoning process. This approach could elicit language models to first contemplate on the abstract level before incorporating concrete details, which is overlooked by the prevailing step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. To align models with the AoT format, we present AoT Collection, a generic finetuning dataset consisting of 348k high-quality samples with AoT reasoning processes, collected via an automated and scalable pipeline. We finetune a wide range of language models with AoT Collection and conduct extensive evaluations on 23 unseen tasks from the challenging benchmark Big-Bench Hard. Experimental results indicate that models aligned to AoT reasoning format substantially outperform those aligned to CoT in many reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Is It Good Data for Multilingual Instruction Tuning or Just Bad Multilingual Evaluation for Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models are designed, claimed, and expected to cater to speakers of varied languages. We hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may not perfectly align with this objective owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which cannot cover language-specific knowledge but can introduce translation defects. It remains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; conversely, it is questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates these issues using controlled native or translated data during the instruction tuning and evaluation stages. We show that native or generation benchmarks reveal a notable difference between native and translated instruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test sets cannot. The comparison between round-trip and single-pass translations reflects the importance of knowledge from language-native resources. Finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial to bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Variable Compliance Control From a Few Demonstrations for Bimanual Robot with Haptic Feedback Teleoperation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating dexterous, contact-rich manipulation tasks using rigid robots is a significant challenge in robotics. Rigid robots, defined by their actuation through position commands, face issues of excessive contact forces due to their inability to adapt to contact with the environment, potentially causing damage. While compliance control schemes have been introduced to mitigate these issues by controlling forces via external sensors, they are hampered by the need for fine-tuning task-specific controller parameters. Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) offers an intuitive alternative, allowing robots to learn manipulations through observed actions. In this work, we introduce a novel system to enhance the teaching of dexterous, contact-rich manipulations to rigid robots. Our system is twofold: firstly, it incorporates a teleoperation interface utilizing Virtual Reality (VR) controllers, designed to provide an intuitive and cost-effective method for task demonstration with haptic feedback. Secondly, we present Comp-ACT (Compliance Control via Action Chunking with Transformers), a method that leverages the demonstrations to learn variable compliance control from a few demonstrations. Our methods have been validated across various complex contact-rich manipulation tasks using single-arm and bimanual robot setups in simulated and real-world environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system in teaching robots dexterous manipulations with enhanced adaptability and safety.

      <title>Generating Is Believing: Membership Inference Attacks against Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique that mitigates issues such as hallucinations and knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant knowledge from an external database to assist in content generation. Existing research has demonstrated potential privacy risks associated with the LLMs of RAG. However, the privacy risks posed by the integration of an external database, which often contains sensitive data such as medical records or personal identities, have remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on membership privacy of RAG's external database, with the aim of determining whether a given sample is part of the RAG's database. Our basic idea is that if a sample is in the external database, it will exhibit a high degree of semantic similarity to the text generated by the RAG system. We present S$^2$MIA, a \underline{M}embership \underline{I}nference \underline{A}ttack that utilizes the \underline{S}emantic \underline{S}imilarity between a given sample and the content generated by the RAG system. With our proposed S$^2$MIA, we demonstrate the potential to breach the membership privacy of the RAG database. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that S$^2$MIA can achieve a strong inference performance compared with five existing MIAs, and is able to escape from the protection of three representative defenses.</description>

      <title>View From Above: A Framework for Evaluating Distribution Shifts in Model Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) are asked to perform certain tasks, how can we be sure that their learned representations align with reality? We propose a domain-agnostic framework for systematically evaluating distribution shifts in LLMs decision-making processes, where they are given control of mechanisms governed by pre-defined rules. While individual LLM actions may appear consistent with expected behavior, across a large number of trials, statistically significant distribution shifts can emerge. To test this, we construct a well-defined environment with known outcome logic: blackjack. In more than 1,000 trials, we uncover statistically significant evidence suggesting behavioral misalignment in the learned representations of LLM.</description>

      <title>LuSNAR:A Lunar Segmentation, Navigation and Reconstruction Dataset based on Muti-sensor for Autonomous Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the complexity of lunar exploration missions, the moon needs to have a higher level of autonomy. Environmental perception and navigation algorithms are the foundation for lunar rovers to achieve autonomous exploration. The development and verification of algorithms require highly reliable data support. Most of the existing lunar datasets are targeted at a single task, lacking diverse scenes and high-precision ground truth labels. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task, multi-scene, and multi-label lunar benchmark dataset LuSNAR. This dataset can be used for comprehensive evaluation of autonomous perception and navigation systems, including high-resolution stereo image pairs, panoramic semantic labels, dense depth maps, LiDAR point clouds, and the position of rover. In order to provide richer scene data, we built 9 lunar simulation scenes based on Unreal Engine. Each scene is divided according to topographic relief and the density of objects. To verify the usability of the dataset, we evaluated and analyzed the algorithms of semantic segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. The experiment results prove that the dataset proposed in this paper can be used for ground verification of tasks such as autonomous environment perception and navigation, and provides a lunar benchmark dataset for testing the accessibility of algorithm metrics. We make LuSNAR publicly available at: https://github.com/zqyu9/LuSNAR-dataset.</description>

Abstract: Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but unfortunately, it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. An alternative approach involves training compressed models directly at a low bitwidth (e.g., binary or ternary models). However, the performance, training dynamics, and scaling trends of such models are not yet well understood. To address this issue, we train and openly release the Spectra LLM suite consisting of 54 language models ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters, trained on 300B tokens. Spectra includes FloatLMs, post-training quantized QuantLMs (3, 4, 6, and 8 bits), and ternary LLMs (TriLMs) - our improved architecture for ternary language modeling, which significantly outperforms previously proposed ternary models of a given size (in bits), matching half-precision models at scale. For example, TriLM 3.9B is (bit-wise) smaller than the half-precision FloatLM 830M, but matches half-precision FloatLM 3.9B in commonsense reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. However, TriLM 3.9B is also as toxic and stereotyping as FloatLM 3.9B, a model six times larger in size. Additionally, TriLM 3.9B lags behind FloatLM in perplexity on validation splits and web-based corpora but performs better on less noisy datasets like Lambada and PennTreeBank.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at \href{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.</description>

      <title>On the Design and Analysis of LLM-Based Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a formal investigation into the design and analysis of LLM-based algorithms, i.e. algorithms that contain one or multiple calls of large language models (LLMs) as sub-routines and critically rely on the capabilities of LLMs. While LLM-based algorithms, ranging from basic LLM calls with prompt engineering to complicated LLM-powered agent systems and compound AI systems, have achieved remarkable empirical success, the design and optimization of them have mostly relied on heuristics and trial-and-errors, which is largely due to a lack of formal and analytical study for these algorithms. To fill this gap, we start by identifying the computational-graph representation of LLM-based algorithms, the design principle of task decomposition, and some key abstractions, which then facilitate our formal analysis for the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-based algorithms, despite the black-box nature of LLMs. Through extensive analytical and empirical investigation in a series of case studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide range of scenarios and diverse patterns of LLM-based algorithms, such as parallel, hierarchical and recursive task decomposition. Our proposed framework holds promise for advancing LLM-based algorithms, by revealing the reasons behind curious empirical phenomena, guiding the choices of hyperparameters, predicting the empirical performance of algorithms, and inspiring new algorithm design. To promote further study of LLM-based algorithms, we release our source code at https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope/tree/main/examples/paper_llm_based_algorithm.</description>

      <title>SR-CurvANN: Advancing 3D Surface Reconstruction through Curvature-Aware Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incomplete or missing data in three-dimensional (3D) models can lead to erroneous or flawed renderings, limiting their usefulness in applications such as visualization, geometric computation, and 3D printing. Conventional surface-repair techniques often fail to infer complex geometric details in missing areas. Neural networks successfully address hole-filling tasks in 2D images using inpainting techniques. The combination of surface reconstruction algorithms, guided by the model's curvature properties and the creativity of neural networks in the inpainting processes should provide realistic results in the hole completion task. In this paper, we propose a novel method entitled SR-CurvANN (Surface Reconstruction Based on Curvature-Aware Neural Networks) that incorporates neural network-based 2D inpainting to effectively reconstruct 3D surfaces. We train the neural networks with images that represent planar representations of the curvature at vertices of hundreds of 3D models. Once the missing areas have been inferred, a coarse-to-fine surface deformation process ensures that the surface fits the reconstructed curvature image. Our proposal makes it possible to learn and generalize patterns from a wide variety of training 3D models, generating comprehensive inpainted curvature images and surfaces. Experiments conducted on 959 models with several holes have demonstrated that SR-CurvANN excels in the shape completion process, filling holes with a remarkable level of realism and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encounter difficulties when addressing complex questions like multi-hop queries. While iterative retrieval methods improve performance by gathering additional information, current approaches often rely on multiple calls of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce EfficientRAG, an efficient retriever for multi-hop question answering. EfficientRAG iteratively generates new queries without the need for LLM calls at each iteration and filters out irrelevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientRAG surpasses existing RAG methods on three open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets.</description>

      <title>General-purpose Clothes Manipulation with Semantic Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clothes manipulation is a critical skill for household robots. Recent advancements have been made in task-specific clothes manipulation, such as folding, flattening, and hanging. However, due to clothes' complex geometries and deformability, creating a general-purpose robot system that can manipulate a diverse range of clothes in many ways remains challenging. Since clothes are typically designed with specific structures, we propose identifying these specific features like ``left sleeve'' as semantic keypoints. Semantic keypoints can provide semantic cues for task planning and geometric cues for low-level action generation. With this insight, we develop a hierarchical learning framework using the large language model (LLM) for general-purpose CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP). Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms baseline methods on both seen and unseen tasks across various clothes manipulation tasks. Real-world experiments show that CLASP can be directly deployed in the real world and applied to a wide variety of clothes.</description>

      <title>ND-SDF: Learning Normal Deflection Fields for High-Fidelity Indoor Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Deflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Intra-Cortical Brain-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people with paraplegia by restoring their ability to perform daily activities. However, current iBMIs suffer from scalability and mobility limitations due to bulky hardware and wiring. Wireless iBMIs offer a solution but are constrained by a limited data rate. To overcome this challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for embedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal convolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final interpolation back to the original sequence length. As recurrent units, we explore gated recurrent units (GRUs), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, and a combination of both - spiking GRUs (sGRUs) and analyze their differences in terms of accuracy, footprint, and activation sparsity. To that end, we train decoders on the "Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench framework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of primate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings while maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current baseline models in the NeuroBench framework. This work highlights the potential of hybrid neural networks to facilitate wireless iBMIs with high decoding precision and a substantial increase in the number of monitored neurons, paving the way toward more advanced neuroprosthetic technologies.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools. Our code is available at https://github.com/olakalisz/antibody-shapers.</description>

      <title>SatFed: A Resource-Efficient LEO Satellite-Assisted Heterogeneous Federated Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional federated learning (FL) frameworks rely heavily on terrestrial networks, where coverage limitations and increasing bandwidth congestion significantly hinder model convergence. Fortunately, the advancement of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks offers promising new communication avenues to augment traditional terrestrial FL. Despite this potential, the limited satellite-ground communication bandwidth and the heterogeneous operating environments of ground devices-including variations in data, bandwidth, and computing power-pose substantial challenges for effective and robust satellite-assisted FL. To address these challenges, we propose SatFed, a resource-efficient satellite-assisted heterogeneous FL framework. SatFed implements freshness-based model prioritization queues to optimize the use of highly constrained satellite-ground bandwidth, ensuring the transmission of the most critical models. Additionally, a multigraph is constructed to capture real-time heterogeneous relationships between devices, including data distribution, terrestrial bandwidth, and computing capability. This multigraph enables SatFed to aggregate satellite-transmitted models into peer guidance, enhancing local training in heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite networks demonstrate that SatFed achieves superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>KAG: Boosting LLMs in Professional Domains via Knowledge Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology has enabled the efficient construction of domain-specific applications. However, it also has limitations, including the gap between vector similarity and the relevance of knowledge reasoning, as well as insensitivity to knowledge logic, such as numerical values, temporal relations, expert rules, and others, which hinder the effectiveness of professional knowledge services. In this work, we introduce a professional domain knowledge service framework called Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG). KAG is designed to address the aforementioned challenges with the motivation of making full use of the advantages of knowledge graph(KG) and vector retrieval, and to improve generation and reasoning performance by bidirectionally enhancing large language models (LLMs) and KGs through five key aspects: (1) LLM-friendly knowledge representation, (2) mutual-indexing between knowledge graphs and original chunks, (3) logical-form-guided hybrid reasoning engine, (4) knowledge alignment with semantic reasoning, and (5) model capability enhancement for KAG. We compared KAG with existing RAG methods in multihop question answering and found that it significantly outperforms state-of-theart methods, achieving a relative improvement of 19.6% on 2wiki and 33.5% on hotpotQA in terms of F1 score. We have successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&amp;A tasks of Ant Group, including E-Government Q&amp;A and E-Health Q&amp;A, achieving significant improvement in professionalism compared to RAG methods.</description>

Abstract: Language models are known to hallucinate incorrect information, and it is unclear if they are sufficiently accurate and reliable for use in scientific research. We developed a rigorous human-AI comparison methodology to evaluate language model agents on real-world literature search tasks covering information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection tasks. We show that PaperQA2, a frontier language model agent optimized for improved factuality, matches or exceeds subject matter expert performance on three realistic literature research tasks without any restrictions on humans (i.e., full access to internet, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 writes cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than existing, human-written Wikipedia articles. We also introduce a hard benchmark for scientific literature research called LitQA2 that guided design of PaperQA2, leading to it exceeding human performance. Finally, we apply PaperQA2 to identify contradictions within the scientific literature, an important scientific task that is challenging for humans. PaperQA2 identifies 2.34 +/- 1.99 contradictions per paper in a random subset of biology papers, of which 70% are validated by human experts. These results demonstrate that language model agents are now capable of exceeding domain experts across meaningful tasks on scientific literature.</description>

      <title>TabGraphs: A Benchmark and Strong Baselines for Learning on Graphs with Tabular Node Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tabular machine learning is an important field for industry and science. In this field, table rows are usually treated as independent data samples, but additional information about relations between them is sometimes available and can be used to improve predictive performance. Such information can be naturally modeled with a graph, thus tabular machine learning may benefit from graph machine learning methods. However, graph machine learning models are typically evaluated on datasets with homogeneous node features, which have little in common with heterogeneous mixtures of numerical and categorical features present in tabular datasets. Thus, there is a critical difference between the data used in tabular and graph machine learning studies, which does not allow one to understand how successfully graph models can be transferred to tabular data. To bridge this gap, we propose a new benchmark of diverse graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features and realistic prediction tasks. We use this benchmark to evaluate a vast set of models, including simple methods previously overlooked in the literature. Our experiments show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can indeed often bring gains in predictive performance for tabular data, but standard tabular models also can be adapted to work with graph data by using simple feature preprocessing, which sometimes enables them to compete with and even outperform GNNs. Based on our empirical study, we provide insights for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Emojis in Texts via Self-supervised Graph Pre-Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emojis have gained immense popularity on social platforms, serving as a common means to supplement or replace text. However, existing data mining approaches generally either completely ignore or simply treat emojis as ordinary Unicode characters, which may limit the model's ability to grasp the rich semantic information in emojis and the interaction between emojis and texts. Thus, it is necessary to release the emoji's power in social media data mining. To this end, we first construct a heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes, i.e. post, word and emoji nodes to improve the representation of different elements in posts. The edges are also well-defined to model how these three elements interact with each other. To facilitate the sharing of information among post, word and emoji nodes, we propose a graph pre-train framework for text and emoji co-modeling, which contains two graph pre-training tasks: node-level graph contrastive learning and edge-level link reconstruction learning. Extensive experiments on the Xiaohongshu and Twitter datasets with two types of downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach proves significant improvement over previous strong baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI needs formal notions of explanation correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) in critical domains such as medicine poses risks and requires regulation. One requirement is that decisions of ML systems in high-risk applications should be human-understandable. The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses this need. However, in its current form, XAI is unfit to provide quality control for ML; it itself needs scrutiny. Popular XAI methods cannot reliably answer important questions about ML models, their training data, or a given test input. We recapitulate results demonstrating that popular XAI methods systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits their utility for purposes such as model and data (in)validation, model improvement, and scientific discovery. We argue that the fundamental reason for this limitation is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against objective criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve first and then design methods accordingly. This will lead to notions of explanation correctness that can be theoretically verified and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data.</description>

      <title>VARADE: a Variational-based AutoRegressive model for Anomaly Detection on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting complex anomalies on massive amounts of data is a crucial task in Industry 4.0, best addressed by deep learning. However, available solutions are computationally demanding, requiring cloud architectures prone to latency and bandwidth issues. This work presents VARADE, a novel solution implementing a light autoregressive framework based on variational inference, which is best suited for real-time execution on the edge. The proposed approach was validated on a robotic arm, part of a pilot production line, and compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, obtaining the best trade-off between anomaly detection accuracy, power consumption and inference frequency on two different edge platforms.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating API-oriented Code Generation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have emerged as powerful tools for code generation, significantly enhancing productivity and accelerating software development. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation, i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the growing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a systematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code generation. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and automated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in API-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library that provides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation and code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated APIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations for Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is invoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we conducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder) and Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks, with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar effectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder and DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality, such as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve high accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code examples. Retrieval-augmented generation enhances the quality of code generated by LLMs, though its effectiveness varies across different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited understanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine inference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1) effectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the interactions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and their impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the large space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated framework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling, multi-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It then transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time techniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this objective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS) algorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and available LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon architectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed inference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of 15.1 and 11.2 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models, respectively. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</description>

      <title>Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.</description>

      <title>IRSC: A Zero-shot Evaluation Benchmark for Information Retrieval through Semantic Comprehension in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), the quality of retrieved information is critical to the final output. This paper introduces the IRSC benchmark for evaluating the performance of embedding models in multilingual RAG tasks. The benchmark encompasses five retrieval tasks: query retrieval, title retrieval, part-of-paragraph retrieval, keyword retrieval, and summary retrieval. Our research addresses the current lack of comprehensive testing and effective comparison methods for embedding models in RAG scenarios. We introduced new metrics: the Similarity of Semantic Comprehension Index (SSCI) and the Retrieval Capability Contest Index (RCCI), and evaluated models such as Snowflake-Arctic, BGE, GTE, and M3E. Our contributions include: 1) the IRSC benchmark, 2) the SSCI and RCCI metrics, and 3) insights into the cross-lingual limitations of embedding models. The IRSC benchmark aims to enhance the understanding and development of accurate retrieval systems in RAG tasks.

      <title>Scenario of Use Scheme: Threat Model Specification for Speaker Privacy Protection in the Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech recordings are being more frequently used to detect and monitor disease, leading to privacy concerns. Beyond cryptography, protection of speech can be addressed by approaches, such as perturbation, disentanglement, and re-synthesis, that eliminate sensitive information of the speaker, leaving the information necessary for medical analysis purposes. In order for such privacy protective approaches to be developed, clear and systematic specifications of assumptions concerning medical settings and the needs of medical professionals are necessary. In this paper, we propose a Scenario of Use Scheme that incorporates an Attacker Model, which characterizes the adversary against whom the speaker's privacy must be defended, and a Protector Model, which specifies the defense. We discuss the connection of the scheme with previous work on speech privacy. Finally, we present a concrete example of a specified Scenario of Use and a set of experiments about protecting speaker data against gender inference attacks while maintaining utility for Parkinson's detection.</description>

      <title>Ascend HiFloat8 Format for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This preliminary white paper proposes a novel 8-bit floating-point data format HiFloat8 (abbreviated as HiF8) for deep learning. HiF8 features tapered precision. For normal value encoding, it provides 7 exponent values with 3-bit mantissa, 8 exponent values with 2-bit mantissa, and 16 exponent values with 1-bit mantissa. For denormal value encoding, it extends the dynamic range by 7 extra powers of 2, from 31 to 38 binades (notice that FP16 covers 40 binades). Meanwhile, HiF8 encodes all the special values except that positive zero and negative zero are represented by only one bit-pattern. Thanks to the better balance between precision and dynamic range, HiF8 can be simultaneously used in both forward and backward passes of AI training. In this paper, we will describe the definition and rounding methods of HiF8, as well as the tentative training and inference solutions. To demonstrate the efficacy of HiF8, massive simulation results on various neural networks, including traditional neural networks and large language models (LLMs), will also be presented.</description>

      <title>Investigating OCR-Sensitive Neurons to Improve Entity Recognition in Historical Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the presence of OCR-sensitive neurons within the Transformer architecture and their influence on named entity recognition (NER) performance on historical documents. By analysing neuron activation patterns in response to clean and noisy text inputs, we identify and then neutralise OCR-sensitive neurons to improve model performance. Based on two open access large language models (Llama2 and Mistral), experiments demonstrate the existence of OCR-sensitive regions and show improvements in NER performance on historical newspapers and classical commentaries, highlighting the potential of targeted neuron modulation to improve models' performance on noisy text.</description>

      <title>INT-FlashAttention: Enabling Flash Attention for INT8 Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the foundation of large language models (LLMs), self-attention module faces the challenge of quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to sequence length. FlashAttention accelerates attention computation and reduces its memory usage by leveraging the GPU memory hierarchy. A promising research direction is to integrate FlashAttention with quantization methods. This paper introduces INT-FlashAttention, the first INT8 quantization architecture compatible with the forward workflow of FlashAttention, which significantly improves the inference speed of FlashAttention on Ampere GPUs. We implement our INT-FlashAttention prototype with fully INT8 activations and general matrix-multiplication (GEMM) kernels, making it the first attention operator with fully INT8 input. As a general token-level post-training quantization framework, INT-FlashAttention is also compatible with other data formats like INT4, etc. Experimental results show INT-FlashAttention achieves 72% faster inference speed and 82% smaller quantization error compared to standard FlashAttention with FP16 and FP8 data format.</description>
