      <title>INTENT: Trajectory Prediction Framework with Intention-Guided Contrastive Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction of road agents (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) is an essential prerequisite for various intelligent systems applications, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</description>

      <title>R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

      <title>FedMABench: Benchmarking Mobile Agents on Decentralized Heterogeneous User Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile agents have attracted tremendous research participation recently. Traditional approaches to mobile agent training rely on centralized data collection, leading to high cost and limited scalability. Distributed training utilizing federated learning offers an alternative by harnessing real-world user data, providing scalability and reducing costs. However, pivotal challenges, including the absence of standardized benchmarks, hinder progress in this field.
  To tackle the challenges, we introduce FedMABench, the first benchmark for federated training and evaluation of mobile agents, specifically designed for heterogeneous scenarios. FedMABench features 6 datasets with 30+ subsets, 8 federated algorithms, 10+ base models, and over 800 apps across 5 categories, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating mobile agents across diverse environments. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: federated algorithms consistently outperform local training; the distribution of specific apps plays a crucial role in heterogeneity; and, even apps from distinct categories can exhibit correlations during training. FedMABench is publicly available at: https://github.com/wwh0411/FedMABench with the datasets at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/wwh0411/FedMABench.</description>

      <title>Path Pooling: Train-Free Structure Enhancement for Efficient Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models achieve strong success in many tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations and knowledge deficiencies in real-world applications. Many knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) methods enhance the quality and credibility of LLMs by leveraging structure and semantic information in KGs as external knowledge bases. However, these methods struggle to effectively incorporate structure information, either incurring high computational costs or underutilizing available knowledge. Inspired by smoothing operations in graph representation learning, we propose path pooling, a simple, train-free strategy that introduces structure information through a novel path-centric pooling operation. It seamlessly integrates into existing KG-RAG methods in a plug-and-play manner, enabling richer structure information utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating the path pooling into the state-of-the-art KG-RAG method consistently improves performance across various settings while introducing negligible additional cost. Code is coming soon at https://github.com/hrwang00/path-pooling.</description>

      <title>WritingBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Generative Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</description>

      <title>Toward an Evaluation Science for Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>VLMs Play StarCraft II: A Benchmark and Multimodal Decision Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VLM-Attention, a multimodal StarCraft II environment that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.</description>

      <title>Ontology Generation using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ontology engineering process is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone, even for experienced ontology engineers. In this work, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide effective OWL ontology drafts directly from ontological requirements described using user stories and competency questions. Our main contribution is the presentation and evaluation of two new prompting techniques for automated ontology development: Memoryless CQbyCQ and Ontogenia. We also emphasize the importance of three structural criteria for ontology assessment, alongside expert qualitative evaluation, highlighting the need for a multi-dimensional evaluation in order to capture the quality and usability of the generated ontologies. Our experiments, conducted on a benchmark dataset of ten ontologies with 100 distinct CQs and 29 different user stories, compare the performance of three LLMs using the two prompting techniques. The results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art in LLM-supported ontology engineering. More specifically, the model OpenAI o1-preview with Ontogenia produces ontologies of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of ontology engineers, significantly outperforming novice ontology engineers in modelling ability. However, we still note some common mistakes and variability of result quality, which is important to take into account when using LLMs for ontology authoring support. We discuss these limitations and propose directions for future research.</description>

      <title>R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.</description>

      <title>Static Vs. Agentic Game Master AI for Facilitating Solo Role-Playing Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19519v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a game master AI for single-player role-playing games. The AI is designed to deliver interactive text-based narratives and experiences typically associated with multiplayer tabletop games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We report on the design process and the series of experiments to improve the functionality and experience design, resulting in two functional versions of the system. While v1 of our system uses simplified prompt engineering, v2 leverages a multi-agent architecture and the ReAct framework to include reasoning and action. A comparative evaluation demonstrates that v2 as an agentic system maintains play while significantly improving modularity and game experience, including immersion and curiosity. Our findings contribute to the evolution of AI-driven interactive fiction, highlighting new avenues for enhancing solo role-playing experiences.</description>

      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces {\em function-coherent gambles}, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models For Optimized Item Categorization using UNSPSC Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective item categorization is vital for businesses, enabling the transformation of unstructured datasets into organized categories that streamline inventory management. Despite its importance, item categorization remains highly subjective and lacks a uniform standard across industries and businesses. The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) provides a standardized system for cataloguing inventory, yet employing UNSPSC categorizations often demands significant manual effort. This paper investigates the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the classification of inventory data into UNSPSC codes based on Item Descriptions. We evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs in categorizing diverse datasets, exploring their language processing capabilities and their potential as a tool for standardizing inventory classification. Our findings reveal that LLMs can substantially diminish the manual labor involved in item categorization while maintaining high accuracy, offering a scalable solution for businesses striving to enhance their inventory management practices.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Logic Programs: Non-Ground and Counting Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a prominent problem-modeling and solving framework, whose solutions are called answer sets. Epistemic logic programs (ELP) extend ASP to reason about all or some answer sets. Solutions to an ELP can be seen as consequences over multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. While the complexity of propositional programs is well studied, the non-ground case remains open. This paper establishes the complexity of non-ground ELPs. We provide a comprehensive picture for well-known program fragments, which turns out to be complete for the class NEXPTIME with access to oracles up to \Sigma^P_2. In the quantitative setting, we establish complexity results for counting complexity beyond #EXP. To mitigate high complexity, we establish results in case of bounded predicate arity, reaching up to the fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we provide ETH-tight runtime results for the parameter treewidth, which has applications in quantitative reasoning, where we reason on (marginal) probabilities of epistemic literals.</description>

Abstract: Food systems are responsible for a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45% on average, compared to 22% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities. Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Intelligence: Aligning Generative AI for Regulatory and Operational Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technical standards, or simply standards, are established documented guidelines and rules that facilitate the interoperability, quality, and accuracy of systems and processes. In recent years, we have witnessed an emerging paradigm shift where the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) models has increased tremendously, spreading implementation interests across standard-driven industries, including engineering, legal, healthcare, and education. In this paper, we assess the criticality levels of different standards across domains and sectors and complement them by grading the current compliance capabilities of state-of-the-art GenAI models. To support the discussion, we outline possible challenges and opportunities with integrating GenAI for standard compliance tasks while also providing actionable recommendations for entities involved with developing and using standards. Overall, we argue that aligning GenAI with standards through computational methods can help strengthen regulatory and operational compliance. We anticipate this area of research will play a central role in the management, oversight, and trustworthiness of larger, more powerful GenAI-based systems in the near future.</description>

      <title>Carelessness Detection using Performance Factor Analysis: A New Operationalization with Unexpectedly Different Relationship to Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of carelessness in digital learning platforms has relied on the contextual slip model, which leverages conditional probability and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to identify careless errors, where students make mistakes despite having the knowledge. However, this model cannot effectively assess carelessness in questions tagged with multiple skills due to the use of conditional probability. This limitation narrows the scope within which the model can be applied. Thus, we propose a novel model, the Beyond Knowledge Feature Carelessness (BKFC) model. The model detects careless errors using performance factor analysis (PFA) and behavioral features distilled from log data, controlling for knowledge when detecting carelessness. We applied the BKFC to detect carelessness in data from middle school students playing a learning game on decimal numbers and operations. We conducted analyses comparing the careless errors detected using contextual slip to the BKFC model. Unexpectedly, careless errors identified by these two approaches did not align. We found students' post-test performance was (corresponding to past results) positively associated with the carelessness detected using the contextual slip model, while negatively associated with the carelessness detected using the BKFC model. These results highlight the complexity of carelessness and underline a broader challenge in operationalizing carelessness and careless errors.</description>

      <title>Copyright in AI-generated works: Lessons from recent developments in patent law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Thaler v The Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (DABUS), Smith J. held that an AI owner can possibly claim patent ownership over an AI-generated invention based on their ownership and control of the AI system. This AI-owner approach reveals a new option to allocate property rights over AI-generated output. While this judgment was primarily about inventorship and ownership of AI-generated invention in patent law, it has important implications for copyright law. After analysing the weaknesses of applying existing judicial approaches to copyright ownership of AI-generated works, this paper examines whether the AI-owner approach is a better option for determining copyright ownership of AI-generated works. The paper argues that while contracts can be used to work around the AI-owner approach in scenarios where users want to commercially exploit the outputs, this approach still provides more certainty and less transaction costs for relevant parties than other approaches proposed so far.</description>

      <title>Responsible Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Roadmap to Society's Trust through Trustworthy AI, Auditability, Accountability, and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has matured as a technology, necessitating the development of responsibility frameworks that are fair, inclusive, trustworthy, safe and secure, transparent, and accountable. By establishing such frameworks, we can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, particularly in high-risk scenarios. This requires the design of responsible AI systems based on trustworthy AI technologies and ethical principles, with the aim of ensuring auditability and accountability throughout their design, development, and deployment, adhering to domain-specific regulations and standards.
  This paper explores the concept of a responsible AI system from a holistic perspective, which encompasses four key dimensions: 1) regulatory context; 2) trustworthy AI technology along with standardization and assessments; 3) auditability and accountability; and 4) AI governance. The aim of this paper is double. First, we analyze and understand these four dimensions and their interconnections in the form of an analysis and overview. Second, the final goal of the paper is to propose a roadmap in the design of responsible AI systems, ensuring that they can gain society's trust. To achieve this trustworthiness, this paper also fosters interdisciplinary discussions on the ethical, legal, social, economic, and cultural aspects of AI from a global governance perspective. Last but not least, we also reflect on the current state and those aspects that need to be developed in the near future, as ten lessons learned.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Perspective Reasoning for Integrated Synthesis and Mediation as a Multi-Perspective Framework for AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose Perspective Reasoning for Integrated Synthesis and Mediation (PRISM), a multiple-perspective framework for addressing persistent challenges in AI alignment such as conflicting human values and specification gaming. Grounded in cognitive science and moral psychology, PRISM organizes moral concerns into seven "basis worldviews", each hypothesized to capture a distinct dimension of human moral cognition, ranging from survival-focused reflexes through higher-order integrative perspectives. It then applies a Pareto-inspired optimization scheme to reconcile competing priorities without reducing them to a single metric. Under the assumption of reliable context validation for robust use, the framework follows a structured workflow that elicits viewpoint-specific responses, synthesizes them into a balanced outcome, and mediates remaining conflicts in a transparent and iterative manner. By referencing layered approaches to moral cognition from cognitive science, moral psychology, and neuroscience, PRISM clarifies how different moral drives interact and systematically documents and mediates ethical tradeoffs. We illustrate its efficacy through real outputs produced by a working prototype, applying PRISM to classic alignment problems in domains such as public health policy, workplace automation, and education. By anchoring AI deliberation in these human vantage points, PRISM aims to bound interpretive leaps that might otherwise drift into non-human or machine-centric territory. We briefly outline future directions, including real-world deployments and formal verifications, while maintaining the core focus on multi-perspective synthesis and conflict mediation.</description>

      <title>Which Information should the UK and US AISI share with an International Network of AISIs? Opportunities, Risks, and a Tentative Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UK AI Safety Institute (UK AISI) and its parallel organisation in the United States (US AISI) take up a unique position in the recently established International Network of AISIs. Both are in jurisdictions with frontier AI companies and are assuming leading roles in the international conversation on AI Safety. This paper argues that it is in the interest of both institutions to share specific categories of information with the International Network of AISIs, deliberately abstain from sharing others and carefully evaluate sharing some categories on a case by case basis, according to domestic priorities. The paper further proposes a provisional framework with which policymakers and researchers can distinguish between these three cases, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of sharing specific categories of information, ranging from pre-deployment evaluation results to evaluation standards. In an effort to further improve the research on AI policy relevant information sharing decisions, the paper emphasises the importance of continuously monitoring fluctuating factors influencing sharing decisions and a more in-depth analysis of specific policy relevant information categories and additional factors to consider in future research.</description>

      <title>A case for specialisation in non-human entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large multi-modal AI models, fuelled by recent interest in large language models (LLMs), the notion of artificial general intelligence (AGI) went from being restricted to a fringe community, to dominate mainstream large AI development programs.
  In contrast, in this paper, we make a \emph{case for specialisation}, by reviewing the pitfalls of generality and stressing the industrial value of specialised
  systems.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we review the most widely accepted arguments \emph{against} specialisation, and discuss how their relevance in the context of human labour is actually an argument \emph{for} specialisation in the case of non human agents, be they algorithms or human organisations. Second, we propose four arguments \emph{in favor of} specialisation, ranging from machine learning robustness, to computer security, social sciences and cultural evolution.
  Third, we finally make a case for \emph{specification}, discuss how the machine learning approach to AI has so far failed to catch up with good practices from safety-engineering and formal verification of software, and discuss how some emerging good practices in machine learning help reduce this gap.
  In particular, we justify the need for \emph{specified governance} for hard-to-specify systems.</description>

      <title>AI Safety is Stuck in Technical Terms -- A System Safety Response to the International AI Safety Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety has become the central value around which dominant AI governance efforts are being shaped. Recently, this culminated in the publication of the International AI Safety Report, written by 96 experts of which 30 nominated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN). The report focuses on the safety risks of general-purpose AI and available technical mitigation approaches. In this response, informed by a system safety perspective, I refl ect on the key conclusions of the report, identifying fundamental issues in the currently dominant technical framing of AI safety and how this frustrates meaningful discourse and policy efforts to address safety comprehensively. The system safety discipline has dealt with the safety risks of software-based systems for many decades, and understands safety risks in AI systems as sociotechnical and requiring consideration of technical and non-technical factors and their interactions. The International AI Safety report does identify the need for system safety approaches. Lessons, concepts and methods from system safety indeed provide an important blueprint for overcoming current shortcomings in technical approaches by integrating rather than adding on non-technical factors and interventions. I conclude with why building a system safety discipline can help us overcome limitations in the European AI Act, as well as how the discipline can help shape sustainable investments into Public Interest AI.</description>

Abstract: Safety cases - clear, assessable arguments for the safety of a system in a given context - are a widely-used technique across various industries for showing a decision-maker (e.g. boards, customers, third parties) that a system is safe. In this paper, we cover how and why frontier AI developers might also want to use safety cases. We then argue that writing and reviewing safety cases would substantially assist in the fulfilment of many of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments. Finally, we outline open research questions on the methodology, implementation, and technical details of safety cases.</description>

Abstract: As part of the Frontier AI Safety Commitments agreed to at the 2024 AI Seoul Summit, many AI developers agreed to publish a safety framework outlining how they will manage potential severe risks associated with their systems. This paper summarises current thinking from companies, governments, and researchers on how to write an effective safety framework. We outline three core areas of a safety framework - risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation, and governance - and identify emerging practices within each area. As safety frameworks are novel and rapidly developing, we hope that this paper can serve both as an overview of work to date and as a starting point for further discussion and innovation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the much proliferation of AI ethical principles in recent years, there is a challenge of assuring AI ethics with current AI ethics frameworks in real-world applications. While system safety has emerged as a distinct discipline for a long time, originated from safety concerns in early aircraft manufacturing. The safety assurance is now an indispensable component in safety critical domains. Motivated by the assurance approaches for safety-critical systems such as aviation, this paper introduces the concept of AI ethics assurance cases into the AI ethics assurance. Three pillars of user requirements, evidence, and validation are proposed as key components and integrated into AI ethics assurance cases for a new approach of user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance. The user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance case is set up based on three pillars and hazard analysis methods used in the safety assurance of safety-critical systems. This paper also proposes a platform named Ethical-Lens (E-LENS) to implement the user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance approach. The proposed user requirements-based E-LENS platform is then applied to assure AI ethics of an AI-driven human resource shortlisting system as a case study to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Position: AI agents should be regulated based on autonomous action sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that AI agents should be regulated based on the sequence of actions they autonomously take. AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we contend that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by AI agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from AI scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of action sequences over existing impact measures that require observing environmental states.</description>

      <title>What is Ethical: AIHED Driving Humans or Human-Driven AIHED? A Conceptual Framework enabling the Ethos of AI-driven Higher education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE) is transforming personalized learning, administrative automation, and decision-making. However, this progress presents a duality, as AI adoption also introduces ethical and institutional challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy risks, and governance inconsistencies. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED) Framework, ensuring compliance with UNESCO and OECD ethical standards. This conceptual research employs a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative studies to identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps in AI adoption within HE. It reinterprets existing datasets through theoretical and ethical lenses to develop governance frameworks. The study applies a participatory integrated co-system, Phased Human Intelligence, SWOC analysis, and AI ethical review boards to assess AI readiness and governance strategies for universities and HE institutions. The HD-AIHED model bridges AI research gaps, addresses global real-time challenges, and provides tailored, scalable, and ethical strategies for diverse educational contexts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders, this study envisions AIHED as a transparent and equitable force for innovation. The HD-AIHED framework ensures AI acts as a collaborative and ethical enabler rather than a disruptive replacement for human intelligence while advocating for responsible AI implementation in HE.</description>

      <title>Transforming Student Evaluation with Adaptive Intelligence and Performance Analytics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for redefining student assessment methodologies. This paper aims to establish the idea of the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its prospect in reshaping approaches to assessing students. It creates a system for the evaluation of students performance using Artificial intelligence, and particularly the Gemini API for the generation of questions, grading and report on the students performances. This is to facilitate easy use of the tools in creating, scheduling, and delivering assessments with minimal chances of cheating through options such as full screen and time limit. There are formats of questions in the system which comprises multiple choice, short answers and descriptive questions, developed by Gemini. The most conspicuous feature is the self-checking system whereby the user gets instant feedback for the correct score that each of the students would have scored instantly with explanations about wrong answers. Moreover, the platform has intelligent learning progressions where the user will be able to monitor his/her performances to be recommended a certain level of performance. It will allow students as well as educators to have real-time analytics and feedback on what they are good at and where they need to improve. Not only does it make the assessment easier, but it also improves the levels of accuracy in grading and effectively strengthens a data based learning process for students.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement in building large language models (LLMs) has intensified competition among big-tech companies and AI startups. In this regard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related decision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress, concerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned their reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators who have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated test prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that despite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private evaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In particular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising from private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading LLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of private expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the models trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to wide-ranging community discussions and policy changes.</description>

Abstract: The AI revolution is gathering momentum at an unprecedented rate. Over the past decade, we have witnessed a seemingly inevitable integration of AI in every facet of our lives. Much has been written about the potential revolutionary impact of AI in education. AI has the potential to completely revolutionise the educational landscape as we could see entire courses and degrees developed by programs such as ChatGPT. AI has the potential to develop courses, set assignments, grade and provide feedback to students much faster than a team of teachers. In addition, because of its dynamic nature, it has the potential to continuously improve its content. In certain fields such as computer science, where technology is continuously evolving, AI based applications can provide dynamically changing, relevant material to students. AI has the potential to replace entire degrees and may challenge the concept of higher education institutions. We could also see entire new disciplines emerge as a consequence of AI. This paper examines the practical impact of ChatGPT and why it is believed that its implementation is a critical step towards a new era of education. We investigate the impact that ChatGPT will have on learning, problem solving skills and cognitive ability of students. We examine the positives, negatives and many other aspects of AI and its applications throughout this paper.</description>

      <title>Which Economic Tasks are Performed with AI? Evidence from Millions of Claude Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence's impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with approximately 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.</description>

      <title>Generating Millions Of Lean Theorems With Proofs By Exploring State Transition Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in generating mathematical proofs. However, a persistent challenge is that LLMs occasionally make mistakes, while even a minor mistake can invalidate an entire proof. Proof assistants like Lean offer a great remedy. They are designed for verifying each step of a proof in a formal language, and in recent years researchers have created AI models to generate proofs in their languages. However, the scarcity of large-scale datasets of Lean proofs restrict the performance of such Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) models.
  We developed LeanNavigator, a novel method for generating a large-scale dataset of Lean theorems and proofs by finding new ways to prove existing Lean theorems. By leveraging an interactive Lean client and an efficient method for proof step generation, LeanNavigator efficiently produces new theorems with corresponding proofs. Applying this approach to Mathlib4, we generated 4.7 million theorems totaling 1 billion tokens, surpassing previous datasets by more than an order of magnitude. Using this extensive dataset, we trained an AI model that outperforms the state-of-the-art ReProver model in theorem-proving tasks. These results confirm our hypothesis and demonstrate the critical role of large datasets in improving the performance of automated theorem provers.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason About Program Semantics? A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions (i.e., \textit{completeness}) and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics (i.e., \textit{consistency}). Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</description>

      <title>MV-CLAM: Multi-View Molecular Interpretation with Cross-Modal Projection via Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human expertise in chemistry and biomedicine relies on contextual molecular understanding, a capability that large language models (LLMs) can extend through fine-grained alignment between molecular structures and text. Recent multimodal learning advances focus on cross-modal alignment, but existing molecule-text models ignore complementary information in different molecular views and rely on single-view representations, limiting molecular understanding. Moreover, na\"ive multi-view alignment strategies face two challenges: (1) separate aligned spaces with inconsistent mappings between molecule and text embeddings, and that (2) existing loss objectives fail to preserve complementary information for fine-grained alignment. This can limit the LLM's ability to fully understand the molecular properties. To address these issues, we propose MV-CLAM, a novel framework that aligns multi-view molecular representations into a unified textual space using a multi-query transformer (MQ-Former). Our approach ensures cross-view consistency while a token-level contrastive loss preserves diverse molecular features across textual queries. MV-CLAM enhances molecular reasoning, improving retrieval and captioning accuracy. The source code of MV-CLAM is available in https://github.com/sumin124/mv-clam.git.</description>

      <title>SMT(LIA) Sampling with High Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Linear Integer Arithmetic, SMT(LIA) for short, is pivotal across various critical domains. Previous research has primarily focused on SMT solving techniques. However, in practical applications such as software and hardware testing, there is a need to generate a diverse set of solutions for use as test inputs. We have developed the first sampling framework that integrates local search with CDCL(T) techniques, named HighDiv, capable of generating a highly diverse set of solutions for constraints under linear integer theory. Initially, in the local search phase, we introduced a novel operator called boundary-aware movement. This operator performs random moves by considering the current state's constraints on variables, thereby enhancing the diversity of variables during the search process. Furthermore, we have conducted an in-depth study of the preprocessing and variable initialization mechanisms within the framework, which significantly enhances the efficiency of subsequent local searches. Lastly, we use the solutions obtained from local search sampling as additional constraints to further explore the solution space using the stochastic CDCL(T) method. Experimental results demonstrate that \HighDiv generates solutions with greater diversity compared to the state-of-the-art SMT(LIA) sampling tool, MeGASampler.</description>

      <title>KunlunBaize: LLM with Multi-Scale Convolution and Multi-Token Prediction Under TransformerX Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they face challenges such as low computational efficiency, gradient vanishing, and difficulties in capturing complex feature interactions. To address these limitations, a novel framework has been proposed. This framework incorporates a learnable dense residual skip connection mechanism, a TransformerX module a transformer based component integrating multiscale convolution and adaptive activation functions and a multitoken prediction interaction module. The learnable dense residual connections enhance information flow and feature capture across layers. Within the TransformerX module, large convolutional kernels aggregate semantic information from extensive text segments, while smaller convolutions focus on local word order and syntactic structures. The adaptive activation function dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the semantic features of the input text, improving the model's ability to handle diverse semantic expressions and complex relationships. The multitoken prediction module boosts data utilization and accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens. These components significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models.</description>

      <title>Towards Anthropomorphic Conversational AI Part I: A Practical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), due to their advanced natural language capabilities, have seen significant success in applications where the user interface is usually a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agent and engages the user through multi-round conversations. However, many scenarios require the agents to exhibit stronger social and conversational intelligence and demonstrate more human-like (anthropomorphic) reactions. This is an aspect that foundational LLMs have yet to fully address such that a single call of foundational models might be insufficient.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage solution. In this work, we focus on the first stage, introducing a multi-module framework designed to replicate the key aspects of human intelligence involved in conversations. This framework comprises thinking modules for reasoning, resource modules for managing knowledge and external information, and response modules for generating contextually appropriate interactions. With all the modules cooperating, the framework would empower the agents to provide a better human-like conversation experience. In the second stage of our approach, these conversational data, after filtering and labeling, can serve as training and testing data for reinforcement learning, enabling AI to better capture human preferences. This stage is left for future work.
  In our experiments, volunteers engaged in over 3000 rounds of conversation with the same AI character powered by a standalone LLM and our framework which integrates the same LLM. A separate group of evaluators rated the conversation samples, revealing that our framework significantly enhanced the social and conversational intelligence, even without fine-tuning the LLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AgroLLM is an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance knowledge-sharing and education in agriculture using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. By using a comprehensive open-source agricultural database, AgroLLM provides accurate, contextually relevant responses while reducing incorrect information retrieval. The system utilizes the FAISS vector database for efficient similarity searches, ensuring rapid access to agricultural knowledge. A comparative study of three advanced models: Gemini 1.5 Flash, ChatGPT-4o Mini, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 was conducted to evaluate performance across four key agricultural domains: Agriculture and Life Sciences, Agricultural Management, Agriculture and Forestry, and Agriculture Business. Key evaluation metrics included embedding quality, search efficiency, and response relevance. Results indicated that ChatGPT-4o Mini with RAG achieved the highest accuracy at 93%. Continuous feedback mechanisms enhance response quality, making AgroLLM a benchmark AI-driven educational tool for farmers, researchers, and professionals, promoting informed decision-making and improved agricultural practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by integrating external knowledge, but generation remains fragile due to the uncertain placement of relevant chunks and retrieval-induced information overload, leading to hallucinations. We propose Ext2Gen, a novel extract-then-generate model that enhances RAG robustness by first extracting query-relevant sentences before generating answers. To optimize this model, we employ preference alignment through pairwise feedback learning, enabling the model to generate robust answers regardless of variations in retrieval results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ext2Gen effectively identifies query-relevant sentences with high precision and recall, leading to highly reliable answers. Furthermore, deploying our model in a RAG environment reveals that it not only boosts the performance of the base LLM but also synergizes with advanced retrieval strategies like query expansion. The dataset and model will be released soon.</description>

      <title>SuperRAG: Beyond RAG with Layout-Aware Graph Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces layout-aware graph modeling for multimodal RAG. Different from traditional RAG methods that mostly deal with flat text chunks, the proposed method takes into account the relationship of multimodalities by using a graph structure. To do that, a graph modeling structure is defined based on document layout parsing. The structure of an input document is retained with the connection of text chunks, tables, and figures. This representation allows the method to handle complex questions that require information from multimodalities. To confirm the efficiency of the graph modeling, a flexible RAG pipeline is developed using robust components. Experimental results on four benchmark test sets confirm the contribution of the layout-aware modeling for performance improvement of the RAG pipeline.</description>

      <title>Cross-linguistic disagreement as a conflict of semantic alignment norms in multilingual AI~Linguistic Diversity as a Problem for Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and AI~</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) face an often-overlooked challenge stemming from intrinsic semantic differences across languages. Linguistic divergence can sometimes lead to cross-linguistic disagreements--disagreements purely due to semantic differences about a relevant concept. This paper identifies such disagreements as conflicts between two fundamental alignment norms in multilingual LLMs: cross-linguistic consistency (CL-consistency), which seeks universal concepts across languages, and consistency with folk judgments (Folk-consistency), which respects language-specific semantic norms. Through examining responses of conversational multilingual AIs in English and Japanese with the cases used in philosophy (cases of knowledge-how attributions), this study demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs provide divergent and internally inconsistent responses. Such findings reveal a novel qualitative limitation in crosslingual knowledge transfer, or conceptual crosslingual knowledge barriers, challenging the assumption that universal representations and cross-linguistic transfer capabilities are inherently desirable. Moreover, they reveal conflicts of alignment policies of their developers, highlighting critical normative questions for LLM researchers and developers. The implications extend beyond technical alignment challenges, raising normative, moral-political, and metaphysical questions about the ideals underlying AI development--questions that are shared with philosophers and cognitive scientists but for which no one yet has definitive answers, inviting a multidisciplinary approach to balance the practical benefits of cross-linguistic consistency and respect for linguistic diversity.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in maintaining privacy, ethics, and compliance, when sensitive or obsolete data must be selectively removed. Retraining these models from scratch is computationally infeasible, necessitating efficient alternatives. As part of the SemEval 2025 Task 4, this work focuses on the application of selective unlearning in LLMs to address this challenge. In this paper, we present our experiments and findings, primarily leveraging global weight modification to achieve an equilibrium between effectiveness of unlearning, knowledge retention, and target model's post-unlearning utility. We also detail the task-specific evaluation mechanism, results, and challenges. Our algorithms have achieved an aggregate score of 0.409 and 0.389 on the test set for 7B and 1B target models, respectively, demonstrating promising results in verifiable LLM unlearning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Hop Document Retrieval Through Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

      <title>Advancing MAPF towards the Real World: A Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (SMART), a realistic and efficient software tool for evaluating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. MAPF focuses on planning collision-free paths for a group of agents. While state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms can plan paths for hundreds of robots in seconds, they often rely on simplified robot models, making their real-world performance unclear. Researchers typically lack access to hundreds of physical robots in laboratory settings to evaluate the algorithms. Meanwhile, industrial professionals who lack expertise in MAPF require an easy-to-use simulator to efficiently test and understand the performance of MAPF algorithms in their specific settings. SMART fills this gap with several advantages: (1) SMART uses a physics-engine-based simulator to create realistic simulation environments, accounting for complex real-world factors such as robot kinodynamics and execution uncertainties, (2) SMART uses an execution monitor framework based on the Action Dependency Graph, facilitating seamless integration with various MAPF algorithms and robot models, and (3) SMART scales to thousands of robots. In addition, we use SMART to explore and demonstrate research questions about the execution of MAPF algorithms in real-world scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://jingtianyan.github.io/publication/2025-smart.</description>

      <title>HoH: A Dynamic Benchmark for Evaluating the Impact of Outdated Information on Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures temporal knowledge evolution in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG.</description>

      <title>Exploring and Evaluating Multimodal Knowledge Reasoning Consistency of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs, enhancing understanding across text and vision. However, current MLLMs still face challenges in effectively integrating knowledge across these modalities during multimodal knowledge reasoning, leading to inconsistencies in reasoning outcomes. To systematically explore this issue, we propose four evaluation tasks and construct a new dataset. We conduct a series of experiments on this dataset to analyze and compare the extent of consistency degradation in multimodal knowledge reasoning within MLLMs. Based on the experimental results, we identify factors contributing to the observed degradation in consistency. Our research provides new insights into the challenges of multimodal knowledge reasoning and offers valuable guidance for future efforts aimed at improving MLLMs.</description>

      <title>The order in speech disorder: a scoping review of state of the art machine learning methods for clinical speech classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background:Speech patterns have emerged as potential diagnostic markers for conditions with varying etiologies. Machine learning (ML) presents an opportunity to harness these patterns for accurate disease diagnosis.
  Objective: This review synthesized findings from studies exploring ML's capability in leveraging speech for the diagnosis of neurological, laryngeal and mental disorders.
  Methods: A systematic examination of 564 articles was conducted with 91 articles included in the study, which encompassed a wide spectrum of conditions, ranging from voice pathologies to mental and neurological disorders. Methods for speech classifications were assessed based on the relevant studies and scored between 0-10 based on the reported diagnostic accuracy of their ML models.
  Results: High diagnostic accuracies were consistently observed for laryngeal disorders, dysarthria, and changes related to speech in Parkinsons disease. These findings indicate the robust potential of speech as a diagnostic tool. Disorders like depression, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers dementia also demonstrated high accuracies, albeit with some variability across studies. Meanwhile, disorders like OCD and autism highlighted the need for more extensive research to ascertain the relationship between speech patterns and the respective conditions.
  Conclusion: ML models utilizing speech patterns demonstrate promising potential in diagnosing a range of mental, laryngeal, and neurological disorders. However, the efficacy varies across conditions, and further research is needed. The integration of these models into clinical practice could potentially revolutionize the evaluation and diagnosis of a number of different medical conditions.</description>

      <title>An energy-efficient learning solution for the Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP) entails finding the subset of observation targets to be scheduled along the satellite's orbit while meeting operational constraints of time, energy and memory. The problem of deciding what and when to observe is inherently complex, and becomes even more challenging when considering several issues that compromise the quality of the captured images, such as cloud occlusion, atmospheric turbulence, and image resolution. This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for addressing the AEOSSP with time-dependent profits, integrating these three factors to optimize the use of energy and memory resources. The proposed method involves a dual decision-making process: selecting the sequence of targets and determining the optimal observation time for each. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the capture of images that fail to meet quality requirements by &gt; 60% and consequently decreases energy waste from attitude maneuvers by up to 78%, all while maintaining strong observation performance.</description>

      <title>Call for Rigor in Reporting Quality of Instruction Tuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for adapting large language models (LLMs) to align with user intentions. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.</description>

      <title>Learning from Failures in Multi-Attempt Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs), exemplified by DeepSeek R1, have shown that even a simple question-answering task can substantially improve an LLM's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we extend this approach by modifying the task into a multi-attempt setting. Instead of generating a single response per question, the model is given multiple attempts, with feedback provided after incorrect responses. The multi-attempt task encourages the model to refine its previous attempts and improve search efficiency. Experimental results show that even a small LLM trained on a multi-attempt task achieves significantly higher accuracy when evaluated with more attempts, improving from 45.6% with 1 attempt to 52.5% with 2 attempts on the math benchmark. In contrast, the same LLM trained on a standard single-turn task exhibits only a marginal improvement, increasing from 42.3% to 43.2% when given more attempts during evaluation. The results indicate that, compared to the standard single-turn task, an LLM trained on a multi-attempt task achieves slightly better performance on math benchmarks while also learning to refine its responses more effectively based on user feedback.

      <title>PanguIR Technical Report for NTCIR-18 AEOLLM Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain widespread attention in both academia and industry, it becomes increasingly critical and challenging to effectively evaluate their capabilities. Existing evaluation methods can be broadly categorized into two types: manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. Manual evaluation, while comprehensive, is often costly and resource-intensive. Conversely, automatic evaluation offers greater scalability but is constrained by the limitations of its evaluation criteria (dominated by reference-based answers). To address these challenges, NTCIR-18 introduced the AEOLLM (Automatic Evaluation of LLMs) task, aiming to encourage reference-free evaluation methods that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this paper, to enhance the evaluation performance of the AEOLLM task, we propose three key methods to improve the reference-free evaluation: 1) Multi-model Collaboration: Leveraging multiple LLMs to approximate human ratings across various subtasks; 2) Prompt Auto-optimization: Utilizing LLMs to iteratively refine the initial task prompts based on evaluation feedback from training samples; and 3) In-context Learning (ICL) Optimization: Based on the multi-task evaluation feedback, we train a specialized in-context example retrieval model, combined with a semantic relevance retrieval model, to jointly identify the most effective in-context learning examples. Experiments conducted on the final dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on the AEOLLM task.</description>

      <title>LLaVE: Large Language and Vision Embedding Models with Hardness-Weighted Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolved Preference Optimization for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities; however, they still struggle with complex multi-step mathematical problem-solving due to error propagation, lack of self-correction, and limited adaptability to diverse reasoning styles. Existing methods rely on static fine-tuning or prompt engineering, which fail to generalize across problem complexities, while the scarcity of high-quality preference data further hinders reliable reasoning.
  We introduce SPHERE, a self-evolving data generation pipeline that enhances reasoning in small language models (SLMs) by iteratively generating, correcting, and diversifying reasoning chains. SPHERE operates in three stages: (i) Self-Generation, where the model autonomously constructs problem-solving steps; (ii) Self-Correction, enabling it to identify and rectify errors; and (iii) Diversity Induction, improving robustness through multiple valid reasoning trajectories. This self-evolution mechanism strengthens mathematical reasoning and enhances model reliability. Evaluations on MATH 500, GSM8K, AIME, AMC, and Olympiad show that SPHERE-trained models achieve significant gains over their base versions and match/surpass GPT-4o on certain benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that self-evolving models can close the reasoning gap between SLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs, making mathematical AI more reliable, scalable, and efficient.</description>

      <title>Normalization through Fine-tuning: Understanding Wav2vec 2.0 Embeddings for Phonetic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonetic normalization plays a crucial role in speech recognition and analysis, ensuring the comparability of features derived from raw audio data. However, in the current paradigm of fine-tuning pre-trained large transformer models, phonetic normalization is not deemed a necessary step; instead, it is implicitly executed within the models. This study investigates the normalization process within transformer models, especially wav2vec 2.0. Through a comprehensive analysis of embeddings from models fine-tuned for various tasks, our results demonstrate that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 effectively achieves phonetic normalization by selectively suppressing task-irrelevant information. We found that models fine-tuned for multiple tasks retain information for both tasks without compromising performance, and that suppressing task-irrelevant information is not necessary for effective classification. These findings provide new insights into how phonetic normalization can be flexibly achieved in speech models and how it is realized in human speech perception.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent System for AI-Assisted Extraction of Narrative Arcs in TV Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serialized TV shows are built on complex storylines that can be hard to track and evolve in ways that defy straightforward analysis. This paper introduces a multi-agent system designed to extract and analyze these narrative arcs. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the system identifies three types of arcs: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific (strictly related to the series' genre). Episodic progressions of these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases, enabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between automation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical interface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize the data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and character entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode summaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler dynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and human expertise in narrative analysis. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats, where the narrative resides entirely in the text. Future work will explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as dialogue and visuals, and expand testing across a wider range of genres to refine the system further.</description>

Abstract: This is the first of a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we demonstrate two things:
  - There is no single standard for measuring whether a Large Language Model (LLM) passes a benchmark, and that choosing a standard has a big impact on how well the LLM does on that benchmark. The standard you choose will depend on your goals for using an LLM in a particular case.
  - It is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question. Specifically, we find that sometimes being polite to the LLM helps performance, and sometimes it lowers performance. We also find that constraining the AI's answers helps performance in some cases, though it may lower performance in other cases.
  Taken together, this suggests that benchmarking AI performance is not one-size-fits-all, and also that particular prompting formulas or approaches, like being polite to the AI, are not universally valuable.</description>

      <title>Technique Inference Engine: A Recommender Model to Support Cyber Threat Hunting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for latent threats in a network. Engaging in threat hunting can be difficult due to the volume of network traffic, variety of adversary techniques, and constantly evolving vulnerabilities. To aid analysts in identifying techniques which may be co-occurring as part of a campaign, we present the Technique Inference Engine, a tool to infer tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) which may be related to existing observations of adversarial behavior. We compile the largest (to our knowledge) available dataset of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports labeled with relevant TTPs. With the knowledge that techniques are chronically under-reported in CTI, we apply several implicit feedback recommender models to the data in order to predict additional techniques which may be part of a given campaign. We evaluate the results in the context of the cyber analyst's use case and apply t-SNE to visualize the model embeddings. We provide our code and a web interface.</description>

      <title>RTFusion: A depth estimation network based on multimodal fusion in challenging scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation in complex real-world scenarios is a challenging task, especially when relying solely on a single modality such as visible light or thermal infrared (THR) imagery. This paper proposes a novel multimodal depth estimation model, RTFusion, which enhances depth estimation accuracy and robustness by integrating the complementary strengths of RGB and THR data. The RGB modality provides rich texture and color information, while the THR modality captures thermal patterns, ensuring stability under adverse lighting conditions such as extreme illumination. The model incorporates a unique fusion mechanism, EGFusion, consisting of the Mutual Complementary Attention (MCA) module for cross-modal feature alignment and the Edge Saliency Enhancement Module (ESEM) to improve edge detail preservation. Comprehensive experiments on the MS2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently produces high-quality depth maps across various challenging environments, including nighttime, rainy, and high-glare conditions. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method in applications requiring reliable depth estimation, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>HeTGB: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Heterophilic Text-Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated success in modeling relational data primarily under the assumption of homophily. However, many real-world graphs exhibit heterophily, where linked nodes belong to different categories or possess diverse attributes. Additionally, nodes in many domains are associated with textual descriptions, forming heterophilic text-attributed graphs (TAGs). Despite their significance, the study of heterophilic TAGs remains underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the Heterophilic Text-attributed Graph Benchmark (HeTGB), a novel benchmark comprising five real-world heterophilic graph datasets from diverse domains, with nodes enriched by extensive textual descriptions. HeTGB enables systematic evaluation of GNNs, pre-trained language models (PLMs) and co-training methods on the node classification task. Through extensive benchmarking experiments, we showcase the utility of text attributes in heterophilic graphs, analyze the challenges posed by heterophilic TAGs and the limitations of existing models, and provide insights into the interplay between graph structures and textual attributes. We have publicly released HeTGB with baseline implementations to facilitate further research in this field.</description>

      <title>DA-STGCN: 4D Trajectory Prediction Based on Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction within air traffic management systems is on the rise. Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</description>

      <title>Preserving Cultural Identity with Context-Aware Translation Through Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language is a cornerstone of cultural identity, yet globalization and the dominance of major languages have placed nearly 3,000 languages at risk of extinction. Existing AI-driven translation models prioritize efficiency but often fail to capture cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and historical significance, leading to translations that marginalize linguistic diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-agent AI framework designed for culturally adaptive translation in underserved language communities. Our approach leverages specialized agents for translation, interpretation, content synthesis, and bias evaluation, ensuring that linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance are preserved. Using CrewAI and LangChain, our system enhances contextual fidelity while mitigating biases through external validation. Comparative analysis shows that our framework outperforms GPT-4o, producing contextually rich and culturally embedded translations, a critical advancement for Indigenous, regional, and low-resource languages. This research underscores the potential of multi-agent AI in fostering equitable, sustainable, and culturally sensitive NLP technologies, aligning with the AI Governance, Cultural NLP, and Sustainable NLP pillars of Language Models for Underserved Communities.

      <title>Beyond Next Word Prediction: Developing Comprehensive Evaluation Frameworks for measuring LLM performance on real world applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally next-token prediction systems, their practical applications extend far beyond this basic function. From natural language processing and text generation to conversational assistants and software use, LLMs have numerous use-cases, and have already acquired a significant degree of enterprise adoption. To evaluate such models, static evaluation datasets, consisting of a set of prompts and their corresponding ground truths, are often used to benchmark the efficacy of the model for a particular task. In this paper, we provide the basis for a more comprehensive evaluation framework, based upon a traditional game and tool-based architecture that enables a more overarching measurement of a model's capabilities. For simplicity, we provide a generalized foundation that can be extended, without significant alteration, to numerous scenarios, from specific use cases such as supply chain management or financial reasoning, to abstract measurements such as ethics or safety.</description>

      <title>StickMotion: Generating 3D Human Motions by Drawing a Stickman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which translates textual descriptions into human motions, has been challenging in accurately capturing detailed user-imagined motions from simple text inputs. This paper introduces StickMotion, an efficient diffusion-based network designed for multi-condition scenarios, which generates desired motions based on traditional text and our proposed stickman conditions for global and local control of these motions, respectively. We address the challenges introduced by the user-friendly stickman from three perspectives: 1) Data generation. We develop an algorithm to generate hand-drawn stickmen automatically across different dataset formats. 2) Multi-condition fusion. We propose a multi-condition module that integrates into the diffusion process and obtains outputs of all possible condition combinations, reducing computational complexity and enhancing StickMotion's performance compared to conventional approaches with the self-attention module. 3) Dynamic supervision. We empower StickMotion to make minor adjustments to the stickman's position within the output sequences, generating more natural movements through our proposed dynamic supervision strategy. Through quantitative experiments and user studies, sketching stickmen saves users about 51.5% of their time generating motions consistent with their imagination. Our codes, demos, and relevant data will be released to facilitate further research and validation within the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Cite Before You Speak: Enhancing Context-Response Grounding in E-commerce Conversational LLM-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of conversational large language models (LLMs), several LLM-based Conversational Shopping Agents (CSA) have been developed to help customers answer questions and smooth their shopping journey in e-commerce domain. The primary objective in building a trustworthy CSA is to ensure the agent's responses are accurate and factually grounded, which is essential for building customer trust and encouraging continuous engagement. However, two challenges remain. First, LLMs produce hallucinated or unsupported claims. Such inaccuracies risk spreading misinformation and diminishing customer trust. Second, without providing knowledge source attribution in CSA response, customers struggle to verify LLM-generated information. To address these challenges, we present an easily productionized solution that enables a "citation experience" utilizing In-context Learning (ICL) and Multi-UX-Inference (MUI) to generate responses with citations to attribute its original sources without interfering other existing UX features. With proper UX design, these citation marks can be linked to the related product information and display the source to our customers. In this work, we also build auto-metrics and scalable benchmarks to holistically evaluate LLM's grounding and attribution capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating this citation generation paradigm can substantially enhance the grounding of LLM responses by 13.83% on the real-world data. As such, our solution not only addresses the immediate challenges of LLM grounding issues but also adds transparency to conversational AI.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in detecting and understanding human emotions through text. Drawing upon emotion models from psychology, we adopt an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates computational and affective sciences insights. The main goal is to assess how accurately they can identify emotions expressed in textual interactions and compare different models on this specific task. This research contributes to broader efforts to enhance human-computer interaction, making artificial intelligence technologies more responsive and sensitive to users' emotional nuances. By employing a methodology that involves comparisons with a state-of-the-art model on the GoEmotions dataset, we aim to gauge LLMs' effectiveness as a system for emotional analysis, paving the way for potential applications in various fields that require a nuanced understanding of human language.</description>

      <title>RD Efficient FPGA Deployment of Learned Image Compression: Knowledge Distillation and Hybrid Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learnable Image Compression (LIC) has shown the potential to outperform standardized video codecs in RD efficiency, prompting the research for hardware-friendly implementations. Most existing LIC hardware implementations prioritize latency to RD-efficiency and through an extensive exploration of the hardware design space. We present a novel design paradigm where the burden of tuning the design for a specific hardware platform is shifted towards model dimensioning and without compromising on RD-efficiency. First, we design a framework for distilling a leaner student LIC model from a reference teacher: by tuning a single model hyperparameters, we can meet the constraints of different hardware platforms without a complex hardware design exploration. Second, we propose a hardware-friendly implementation of the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) activation that preserves RD efficiency even post parameter quantization. Third, we design a pipelined FPGA configuration which takes full advantage of available FPGA resources by leveraging parallel processing and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments with a state of the art LIC model show that we outperform all existing FPGA implementations while performing very close to the original model in terms of RD efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Training for Multimodal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides in cross-modal comprehension and generation tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation Merging: Keep Improving With Extrapolation and Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require instruction fine-tuning to perform different downstream tasks. However, the instruction fine-tuning phase still demands significant computational resources and labeled data, lacking a paradigm that can improve model performance without additional computational power and data. Model merging aims to enhance performance by combining the parameters of different models, but the lack of a clear optimization direction during the merging process does not always guarantee improved performance. In this paper, we attempt to provide a clear optimization direction for model merging. We first validate the effectiveness of the model extrapolation method during the instruction fine-tuning phase. Then, we propose Extrapolation Merging, a paradigm that can continue improving model performance without requiring extra computational resources or data. Using the extrapolation method, we provide a clear direction for model merging, achieving local optimization search, and consequently enhancing the merged model's performance. We conduct experiments on seven different tasks, and the results show that our method can consistently improve the model's performance after fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Distilling Dataset into Neural Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing a large-scale dataset is essential for training high-performance deep learning models, but it also comes with substantial computation and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution by compressing the large-scale dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset that retains the essential information needed for training. This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for dataset distillation, coined Distilling Dataset into Neural Field (DDiF), which leverages the neural field to store the necessary information of the large-scale dataset. Due to the unique nature of the neural field, which takes coordinates as input and output quantity, DDiF effectively preserves the information and easily generates various shapes of data. We theoretically confirm that DDiF exhibits greater expressiveness than some previous literature when the utilized budget for a single synthetic instance is the same. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DDiF achieves superior performance on several benchmark datasets, extending beyond the image domain to include video, audio, and 3D voxel. We release the code at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DDiF.</description>

      <title>PGAD: Prototype-Guided Adaptive Distillation for Multi-Modal Learning in AD Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing modalities pose a major issue in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, as many subjects lack full imaging data due to cost and clinical constraints. While multi-modal learning leverages complementary information, most existing methods train only on complete data, ignoring the large proportion of incomplete samples in real-world datasets like ADNI. This reduces the effective training set and limits the full use of valuable medical data. While some methods incorporate incomplete samples, they fail to effectively address inter-modal feature alignment and knowledge transfer challenges under high missing rates. To address this, we propose a Prototype-Guided Adaptive Distillation (PGAD) framework that directly incorporates incomplete multi-modal data into training. PGAD enhances missing modality representations through prototype matching and balances learning with a dynamic sampling strategy. We validate PGAD on the ADNI dataset with varying missing rates (20%, 50%, and 70%) and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of prototype matching and adaptive sampling, highlighting the potential of our framework for robust and scalable AD diagnosis in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>FedPalm: A General Federated Learning Framework for Closed- and Open-Set Palmprint Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current deep learning (DL)-based palmprint verification models rely on centralized training with large datasets, which raises significant privacy concerns due to biometric data's sensitive and immutable nature. Federated learning~(FL), a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, offers a compelling alternative by enabling collaborative model training without the need for data sharing. However, FL-based palmprint verification faces critical challenges, including data heterogeneity from diverse identities and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper addresses these gaps by establishing a comprehensive benchmark for FL-based palmprint verification, which explicitly defines and evaluates two practical scenarios: closed-set and open-set verification. We propose FedPalm, a unified FL framework that balances local adaptability with global generalization. Each client trains a personalized textural expert tailored to local data and collaboratively contributes to a shared global textural expert for extracting generalized features. To further enhance verification performance, we introduce a Textural Expert Interaction Module that dynamically routes textural features among experts to generate refined side textural features. Learnable parameters are employed to model relationships between original and side features, fostering cross-texture-expert interaction and improving feature discrimination. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FedPalm, demonstrating robust performance across both scenarios and providing a promising foundation for advancing FL-based palmprint verification research.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multimodal In-Context Learning in Large Vision-Language Models with Task-aware Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), driven by their increasing scale and applicability. Despite its promise, effective ICL in the multimodal setting remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of image-text inputs and the high sensitivity of ICL performance to input configurations. In this work, we shed light on the core mechanism underlying multimodal ICL, identifying task mapping as a crucial factor in configuring robust in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences. Building on these insights, we propose \textit{SabER}, a lightweight yet powerful decoder-only transformer equipped with task-aware attention, which intelligently selects and arranges ICDs from a demonstration library in an autoregressive fashion. This design enables fine-grained feature extraction and cross-modal reasoning, iteratively refining task mapping to generate high-quality ICD sequences. Through extensive experiments covering five LVLMs and nine benchmark datasets, SabER not only demonstrates strong empirical performance, but also provides deeper understanding of how task semantics interact with multimodal ICDs. Our findings highlight the importance of principled ICD sequence configuration and open new avenues to enhance multimodal ICL in a wide range of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Framing the Game: How Context Shapes LLM Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse contexts to support decision-making. While existing evaluations effectively probe latent model capabilities, they often overlook the impact of context framing on perceived rational decision-making. In this study, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically varies evaluation instances across key features and procedurally generates vignettes to create highly varied scenarios. By analyzing decision-making patterns across different contexts with the same underlying game structure, we uncover significant contextual variability in LLM responses. Our findings demonstrate that this variability is largely predictable yet highly sensitive to framing effects. Our results underscore the need for dynamic, context-aware evaluation methodologies for real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Replicating Human Social Perception in Generative AI: Evaluating the Valence-Dominance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance--particularly in generative models--an open question is whether these systems can replicate foundational models of human social perception. A well-established framework in social cognition suggests that social judgments are organized along two primary dimensions: valence (e.g., trustworthiness, warmth) and dominance (e.g., power, assertiveness). This study examines whether multimodal generative AI systems can reproduce this valence-dominance structure when evaluating facial images and how their representations align with those observed across world regions. Through principal component analysis (PCA), we found that the extracted dimensions closely mirrored the theoretical structure of valence and dominance, with trait loadings aligning with established definitions. However, many world regions and generative AI models also exhibited a third component, the nature and significance of which warrant further investigation. These findings demonstrate that multimodal generative AI systems can replicate key aspects of human social perception, raising important questions about their implications for AI-driven decision-making and human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>ZAugNet for Z-Slice Augmentation in Bio-Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional biological microscopy has significantly advanced our understanding of complex biological structures. However, limitations due to microscopy techniques, sample properties or phototoxicity often result in poor z-resolution, hindering accurate cellular measurements. Here, we introduce ZAugNet, a fast, accurate, and self-supervised deep learning method for enhancing z-resolution in biological images. By performing nonlinear interpolation between consecutive slices, ZAugNet effectively doubles resolution with each iteration. Compared on several microscopy modalities and biological objects, it outperforms competing methods on most metrics. Our method leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture combined with knowledge distillation to maximize prediction speed without compromising accuracy. We also developed ZAugNet+, an extended version enabling continuous interpolation at arbitrary distances, making it particularly useful for datasets with nonuniform slice spacing. Both ZAugNet and ZAugNet+ provide high-performance, scalable z-slice augmentation solutions for large-scale 3D imaging. They are available as open-source frameworks in PyTorch, with an intuitive Colab notebook interface for easy access by the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Universal Narrative Model: an Author-centric Storytelling Framework for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI promises to finally realize dynamic, personalized storytelling technologies across a range of media. To date, experimentation with generative AI in the field of procedural narrative generation has been quite promising from a technical perspective. However, fundamental narrative dilemmas remain, such as the balance between player agency and narrative coherence, and no rigorous narrative standard has been proposed to specifically leverage the strengths of generative AI. In this paper, we propose the Universal Narrative Model (UNM), an open and extensible standard designed to place writers at the center of future narrative design workflows and enable interoperability across authoring platforms. By encoding an author's intent according to an objective narrative model, the UNM enables narrative portability as well as intent-based constraints for generative systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming industries by enabling intelligent content generation, automation, and decision-making. However, the effectiveness of GenAI applications depends significantly on efficient data storage, retrieval, and contextual augmentation. This paper explores the critical role of databases in GenAI workflows, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right database architecture to optimize performance, accuracy, and scalability. It categorizes database roles into conversational context (key-value/document databases), situational context (relational databases/data lakehouses), and semantic context (vector databases) each serving a distinct function in enriching AI-generated responses. Additionally, the paper highlights real-time query processing, vector search for semantic retrieval, and the impact of database selection on model efficiency and scalability. By leveraging a multi-database approach, GenAI applications can achieve more context-aware, personalized, and high-performing AI-driven solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Collective Intelligence in Large Language Models Through Emotional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the integration of emotional diversity into Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance collective intelligence. Inspired by the human wisdom of crowds phenomenon, where group decisions often outperform individual judgments, we fine-tuned the DarkIdol-Llama-3.1-8B model using Google's GoEmotions dataset and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to simulate emotionally diverse responses. Evaluating the model on a distance estimation task between Fargo, ND, and Seattle, WA, across 15,064 unique persona configurations, we analyzed how emotional states and social attributes influence decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that emotional integration shapes response patterns while maintaining acceptable prediction accuracy, revealing its potential to enhance artificial collective intelligence. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay of emotional diversity and decision-making in LLMs, suggesting pathways for creating emotionally aware AI systems that balance emotional depth with analytical precision.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>One-Shot is Enough: Consolidating Multi-Turn Attacks into Efficient Single-Turn Prompts for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive safety enhancements in large language models (LLMs), multi-turn "jailbreak" conversations crafted by skilled human adversaries can still breach even the most sophisticated guardrails. However, these multi-turn attacks demand considerable manual effort, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Multi-turn-to-Single-turn (M2S) that systematically converts multi-turn jailbreak prompts into single-turn attacks. Specifically, we propose three conversion strategies - Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize - each preserving sequential context yet packaging it in a single query. Our experiments on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset show that M2S often increases or maintains high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) compared to original multi-turn conversations. Notably, using a StrongREJECT-based evaluation of harmfulness, M2S achieves up to 95.9% ASR on Mistral-7B and outperforms original multi-turn prompts by as much as 17.5% in absolute improvement on GPT-4o. Further analysis reveals that certain adversarial tactics, when consolidated into a single prompt, exploit structural formatting cues to evade standard policy checks. These findings underscore that single-turn attacks - despite being simpler and cheaper to conduct - can be just as potent, if not more, than their multi-turn counterparts. Our findings underscore the urgent need to reevaluate and reinforce LLM safety strategies, given how adversarial queries can be compacted into a single prompt while still retaining sufficient complexity to bypass existing safety measures.</description>

      <title>SHAPE : Self-Improved Visual Preference Alignment by Iteratively Generating Holistic Winner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment to ensure reliability, which steers the model behavior via preference fine-tuning on preference data structured as ``image - winner text - loser text'' triplets. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited diversity and high costs associated with human-annotated preference data, hindering LVLMs from fully achieving their intended alignment capabilities. We present \projectname, a self-supervised framework capable of transforming the already abundant supervised text-image pairs into holistic preference triplets for more effective and cheaper LVLM alignment, eliminating the need for human preference annotations. Our approach facilitates LVLMs in progressively enhancing alignment capabilities through iterative self-improvement. The key design rationale is to devise preference triplets where the winner text consistently improves in holisticness and outperforms the loser response in quality, thereby pushing the model to ``strive to the utmost'' of alignment performance through preference fine-tuning. For each given text-image pair, SHAPE introduces multiple visual augmentations and pairs them with a summarized text to serve as the winner response, while designating the original text as the loser response. Experiments across \textbf{12} benchmarks on various model architectures and sizes, including LLaVA and DeepSeek-VL, show that SHAPE achieves significant gains, for example, achieving +11.3\% on MMVet (comprehensive evaluation), +1.4\% on MMBench (general VQA), and +8.0\% on POPE (hallucination robustness) over baselines in 7B models. Notably, qualitative analyses confirm enhanced attention to visual details and better alignment with human preferences for holistic descriptions.</description>

      <title>Codebook Reduction and Saturation: Novel observations on Inductive Thematic Saturation for Large Language Models and initial coding in Thematic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reflects on the process of performing Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper deals with the problem of analytical saturation of initial codes, as produced by LLMs. Thematic Analysis is a well-established qualitative analysis method composed of interlinked phases. A key phase is the initial coding, where the analysts assign labels to discrete components of a dataset. Saturation is a way to measure the validity of a qualitative analysis and relates to the recurrence and repetition of initial codes. In the paper we reflect on how well LLMs achieve analytical saturation and propose also a novel technique to measure Inductive Thematic Saturation (ITS). This novel technique leverages a programming framework called DSPy. The proposed novel approach allows a precise measurement of ITS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with voxel-based grid prediction, in the field of 3D semantic occupation prediction for autonomous driving, GaussianFormer proposed using 3D Gaussian to describe scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussian based on objects is another scheme with lower memory requirements. Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</description>

      <title>E4: Energy-Efficient DNN Inference for Edge Video Analytics Via Early-Exit and DVFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models are increasingly popular in edge video analytic applications. However, the compute-intensive nature of DNN models pose challenges for energy-efficient inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Most existing solutions focus on optimizing DNN inference latency and accuracy, often overlooking energy efficiency. They also fail to account for the varying complexity of video frames, leading to sub-optimal performance in edge video analytics. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Efficient Early-Exit (E4) framework that enhances DNN inference efficiency for edge video analytics by integrating a novel early-exit mechanism with dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) governors. It employs an attention-based cascade module to analyze video frame diversity and automatically determine optimal DNN exit points. Additionally, E4 features a just-in-time (JIT) profiler that uses coordinate descent search to co-optimize CPU and GPU clock frequencies for each layer before the DNN exit points. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that E4 outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.8x speedup and 26% average energy saving while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: As the use of facial recognition technology is expanding in different domains, ensuring its responsible use is gaining more importance. This paper conducts a comprehensive literature review of existing studies on facial recognition technology from the perspective of privacy, which is one of the key Responsible AI principles.
  Cloud providers, such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google, are at the forefront of delivering facial-related technology services, but their approaches to responsible use of these technologies vary significantly. This paper compares how these cloud giants implement the privacy principle into their facial recognition and detection services. By analysing their approaches, it identifies both common practices and notable differences. The results of this research will be valuable for developers and businesses by providing them insights into best practices of three major companies for integration responsible AI, particularly privacy, into their cloud-based facial recognition technologies.</description>

      <title>Label Distribution Learning-Enhanced Dual-KNN for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many text classification methods usually introduce external information (e.g., label descriptions and knowledge bases) to improve the classification performance. Compared to external information, some internal information generated by the model itself during training, like text embeddings and predicted label probability distributions, are exploited poorly when predicting the outcomes of some texts. In this paper, we focus on leveraging this internal information, proposing a dual $k$ nearest neighbor (D$k$NN) framework with two $k$NN modules, to retrieve several neighbors from the training set and augment the distribution of labels. For the $k$NN module, it is easily confused and may cause incorrect predictions when retrieving some nearest neighbors from noisy datasets (datasets with labeling errors) or similar datasets (datasets with similar labels). To address this issue, we also introduce a label distribution learning module that can learn label similarity, and generate a better label distribution to help models distinguish texts more effectively. This module eases model overfitting and improves final classification performance, hence enhancing the quality of the retrieved neighbors by $k$NN modules during inference. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>TinyR1-32B-Preview: Boosting Accuracy with Branch-Merge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of reducing the size of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining their performance has gained significant attention. However, existing methods, such as model distillation and transfer learning, often fail to achieve high accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce the Branch-Merge distillation approach, which enhances model compression through two phases: (1) the Branch Phase, where knowledge from a large teacher model is \textit{selectively distilled} into specialized student models via domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT); And (2) the Merge Phase, where these student models are merged to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve generalization. We validate our distillation approach using DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the student. The resulting merged model, TinyR1-32B-Preview, outperforms its counterpart DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks, including Mathematics (+5.5 points), Coding (+4.4 points) and Science (+2.9 points), while achieving near-equal performance to DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024. The Branch-Merge distillation approach provides a scalable solution for creating smaller, high-performing LLMs with reduced computational cost and time.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Good In-context Learners for Financial Sentiment Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have demonstrated the emergent ability, surpassing traditional methods in various domains even without fine-tuning over domain-specific data. However, when it comes to financial sentiment analysis (FSA)$\unicode{x2013}$a fundamental task in financial AI$\unicode{x2013}$these models often encounter various challenges, such as complex financial terminology, subjective human emotions, and ambiguous inclination expressions. In this paper, we aim to answer the fundamental question: whether LLMs are good in-context learners for FSA? Unveiling this question can yield informative insights on whether LLMs can learn to address the challenges by generalizing in-context demonstrations of financial document-sentiment pairs to the sentiment analysis of new documents, given that finetuning these models on finance-specific data is difficult, if not impossible at all. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper exploring in-context learning for FSA that covers most modern LLMs (recently released DeepSeek V3 included) and multiple in-context sample selection methods. Comprehensive experiments validate the in-context learning capability of LLMs for FSA.</description>

      <title>Adapt3R: Adaptive 3D Scene Representation for Domain Transfer in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has been very effective in training robots to perform complex and diverse manipulation tasks. However, its performance declines precipitously when the observations are out of the training distribution. 3D scene representations that incorporate observations from calibrated RGBD cameras have been proposed as a way to improve generalizability of IL policies, but our evaluations in cross-embodiment and novel camera pose settings found that they show only modest improvement. To address those challenges, we propose Adaptive 3D Scene Representation (Adapt3R), a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which uses a novel architecture to synthesize data from one or more RGBD cameras into a single vector that can then be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained 2D backbone to extract semantic information about the scene, using 3D only as a medium for localizing this semantic information with respect to the end-effector. We show that when trained end-to-end with several SOTA multi-task IL algorithms, Adapt3R maintains these algorithms' multi-task learning capacity while enabling zero-shot transfer to novel embodiments and camera poses. Furthermore, we provide a detailed suite of ablation and sensitivity experiments to elucidate the design space for point cloud observation encoders.</description>

      <title>HILGEN: Hierarchically-Informed Data Generation for Biomedical NER Using Knowledgebases and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HILGEN, a Hierarchically-Informed Data Generation approach that combines domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5. Our approach leverages UMLS's hierarchical structure to expand training data with related concepts, while incorporating contextual information from LLMs through targeted prompts aimed at automatically generating synthetic examples for sparsely occurring named entities. The performance of the HILGEN approach was evaluated across four biomedical NER datasets (MIMIC III, BC5CDR, NCBI-Disease, and Med-Mentions) using BERT-Large and DANN (Data Augmentation with Nearest Neighbor Classifier) models, applying various data generation strategies, including UMLS, GPT-3.5, and their best ensemble. For the BERT-Large model, incorporating UMLS led to an average F1 score improvement of 40.36%, while using GPT-3.5 resulted in a comparable average increase of 40.52%. The Best-Ensemble approach using BERT-Large achieved the highest improvement, with an average increase of 42.29%. DANN model's F1 score improved by 22.74% on average using the UMLS-only approach. The GPT-3.5-based method resulted in a 21.53% increase, and the Best-Ensemble DANN model showed a more notable improvement, with an average increase of 25.03%. Our proposed HILGEN approach improves NER performance in few-shot settings without requiring additional manually annotated data. Our experiments demonstrate that an effective strategy for optimizing biomedical NER is to combine biomedical knowledge curated in the past, such as the UMLS, and generative LLMs to create synthetic training instances. Our future research will focus on exploring additional innovative synthetic data generation strategies for further improving NER performance.</description>

      <title>Curiosity-Driven Imagination: Discovering Plan Operators and Learning Associated Policies for Open-World Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting quickly to dynamic, uncertain environments-often called "open worlds"-remains a major challenge in robotics. Traditional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches struggle to cope with unforeseen changes, are data-inefficient when adapting, and do not leverage world models during learning. We address this issue with a hybrid planning and learning system that integrates two models: a low level neural network based model that learns stochastic transitions and drives exploration via an Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and a high level symbolic planning model that captures abstract transitions using operators, enabling the agent to plan in an "imaginary" space and generate reward machines. Our evaluation in a robotic manipulation domain with sequential novelty injections demonstrates that our approach converges faster and outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short paper presents research findings on two learning-based methods for quantifying measurement uncertainties in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). We investigate two learning strategies: offline learning for outlier prediction and online learning for noise distribution approximation, specifically applied to GNSS pseudorange observations. To develop and evaluate these learning methods, we introduce a novel multisensor state estimator that accurately and robustly estimates trajectory from multiple sensor inputs, critical for deriving GNSS measurement residuals used to train the uncertainty models. We validate the proposed learning-based models using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Experimental results demonstrate that both models effectively handle GNSS outliers and improve state estimation performance. Furthermore, we provide insightful discussions to motivate future research toward developing a federated framework for robust vehicle localization in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>VQEL: Enabling Self-Developed Symbolic Language in Agents through Vector Quantization in Emergent Language Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of emergent language, efforts have traditionally focused on developing communication protocols through interactions between agents in referential games. However, the aspect of internal language learning, where language serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a means for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains underexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's involvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic representations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge here is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through self-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the solution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We introduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the agents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete symbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the self-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement learning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that VQEL not only outperforms the traditional REINFORCE method but also benefits from improved control and reduced susceptibility to collapse, thanks to the incorporation of vector quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has presented significant challenges in distinguishing authentic human-authored content from deepfake content. Collaborative human efforts, augmented by AI tools, present a promising solution. In this study, we explore the potential of DeepFakeDeLiBot, a deliberation-enhancing chatbot, to support groups in detecting deepfake text. Our findings reveal that group-based problem-solving significantly improves the accuracy of identifying machine-generated paragraphs compared to individual efforts. While engagement with DeepFakeDeLiBot does not yield substantial performance gains overall, it enhances group dynamics by fostering greater participant engagement, consensus building, and the frequency and diversity of reasoning-based utterances. Additionally, participants with higher perceived effectiveness of group collaboration exhibited performance benefits from DeepFakeDeLiBot. These findings underscore the potential of deliberative chatbots in fostering interactive and productive group dynamics while ensuring accuracy in collaborative deepfake text detection. \textit{Dataset and source code used in this study will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Federated Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation is to evaluate the causal effects of treatment strategies on some important outcomes, which is a crucial problem in healthcare. Most existing ITE estimation methods are designed for centralized settings. However, in real-world clinical scenarios, the raw data are usually not shareable among hospitals due to the potential privacy and security risks, which makes the methods not applicable. In this work, we study the ITE estimation task in a federated setting, which allows us to harness the decentralized data from multiple hospitals. Due to the unavoidable confounding bias in the collected data, a model directly learned from it would be inaccurate. One well-known solution is Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW), which uses the conditional probability of treatment given the covariates to re-weight each training example. Applying IPTW in a federated setting, however, is non-trivial. We found that even with a well-estimated conditional probability, the local model training step using each hospital's data alone would still suffer from confounding bias. To address this, we propose FED-IPTW, a novel algorithm to extend IPTW into a federated setting that enforces both global (over all the data) and local (within each hospital) decorrelation between covariates and treatments. We validated our approach on the task of comparing the treatment effects of mechanical ventilation on improving survival probability for patients with breadth difficulties in the intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world eICU datasets and the results show that FED-IPTW outperform state-of-the-art methods on all the metrics on factual prediction and ITE estimation tasks, paving the way for personalized treatment strategy design in mechanical ventilation usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly proficient at solving web-based tasks. With this capability comes a greater risk of misuse for malicious purposes, such as posting misinformation in an online forum or selling illicit substances on a website. To evaluate these risks, we propose SafeArena, the first benchmark to focus on the deliberate misuse of web agents. SafeArena comprises 250 safe and 250 harmful tasks across four websites. We classify the harmful tasks into five harm categories -- misinformation, illegal activity, harassment, cybercrime, and social bias, designed to assess realistic misuses of web agents. We evaluate leading LLM-based web agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Qwen-2-VL 72B, and Llama-3.2 90B, on our benchmark. To systematically assess their susceptibility to harmful tasks, we introduce the Agent Risk Assessment framework that categorizes agent behavior across four risk levels. We find agents are surprisingly compliant with malicious requests, with GPT-4o and Qwen-2 completing 34.7% and 27.3% of harmful requests, respectively. Our findings highlight the urgent need for safety alignment procedures for web agents. Our benchmark is available here: https://safearena.github.io</description>

      <title>Energy-Latency Attacks: A New Adversarial Threat to Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing computational demand for deep neural networks ( DNNs) has raised concerns about their energy consumption and carbon footprint, particularly as the size and complexity of the models continue to increase. To address these challenges, energy-efficient hardware and custom accelerators have become essential. Additionally, adaptable DNN s are being developed to dynamically balance performance and efficiency. The use of these strategies became more common to enable sustainable AI deployment. However, these efficiency-focused designs may also introduce vulnerabilities, as attackers can potentially exploit them to increase latency and energy usage by triggering their worst-case-performance scenarios. This new type of attack, called energy-latency attacks, has recently gained significant research attention, focusing on the vulnerability of DNN s to this emerging attack paradigm, which can trigger denial-of-service ( DoS) attacks. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of current research on energy-latency attacks, categorizing them using the established taxonomy for traditional adversarial attacks. We explore different metrics used to measure the success of these attacks and provide an analysis and comparison of existing attack strategies. We also analyze existing defense mechanisms and highlight current challenges and potential areas for future research in this developing field.

      <title>Prediction of Frozen Region Growth in Kidney Cryoablation Intervention Using a 3D Flow-Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a 3D flow-matching model designed to predict the progression of the frozen region (iceball) during kidney cryoablation. Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.</description>

Applying learning-based methods to address mobile robot tasks has gained popularity due to its robustness and generalizability. Traditional methods such as Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer adaptability but require large datasets, carefully crafted reward functions, and face sim-to-real gaps, making them challenging for efficient and safe real-world deployment. We propose an online human-in-the-loop learning method PVP4Real that combines IL and RL to address these issues. PVP4Real enables efficient real-time policy learning from online human intervention and demonstration, without reward or any pretraining, significantly improving data efficiency and training safety. We validate our method by training two different robots -- a legged quadruped, and a wheeled delivery robot -- in two mobile robot tasks, one of which even uses raw RGBD image as observation. The training finishes within 15 minutes. Our experiments show the promising future of human-in-the-loop learning in addressing the data efficiency issue in real-world robotic tasks.

      <title>Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</description>

      <title>Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Relevance of Youth Research Cited in the US Policy Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing concern and emphasis on conducting research beyond academic or scientific research communities, benefiting society at large. A well-known approach to measuring the impact of research on society is enumerating its policy citation(s). Despite the importance of research in informing policy, there is no concrete evidence to suggest the research's relevance in cited policy documents. This is concerning because it may increase the possibility of evidence used in policy being manipulated by individual, social, or political biases that may lead to inappropriate, fragmented, or archaic research evidence in policy. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the degree of relevance between research articles and citing policy documents. In this paper, we examined the scale of contextual relevance of youth-focused research in the referenced US policy documents using natural language processing techniques, state-of-the-art pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), and statistical analysis. Our experiments and analysis concluded that youth-related research articles that get US policy citations are mostly relevant to the citing policy documents.</description>

      <title>A Consensus Privacy Metrics Framework for Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is one approach for sharing individual-level data. However, to meet legislative requirements, it is necessary to demonstrate that the individuals' privacy is adequately protected. There is no consolidated standard for measuring privacy in synthetic data. Through an expert panel and consensus process, we developed a framework for evaluating privacy in synthetic data. Our findings indicate that current similarity metrics fail to measure identity disclosure, and their use is discouraged. For differentially private synthetic data, a privacy budget other than close to zero was not considered interpretable. There was consensus on the importance of membership and attribute disclosure, both of which involve inferring personal information about an individual without necessarily revealing their identity. The resultant framework provides precise recommendations for metrics that address these types of disclosures effectively. Our findings further present specific opportunities for future research that can help with widespread adoption of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>LVLM-Compress-Bench: Benchmarking the Broader Impact of Large Vision-Language Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent efforts in understanding the compression impact on large language models (LLMs) in terms of their downstream task performance and trustworthiness on relatively simpler uni-modal benchmarks (for example, question answering, common sense reasoning), their detailed study on multi-modal Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is yet to be unveiled. Towards mitigating this gap, we present LVLM-Compress-Bench, a framework to first thoroughly study the broad impact of compression on the generative performance of LVLMs with multi-modal input driven tasks. In specific, we consider two major classes of compression for autoregressive models, namely KV cache and weight compression, for the dynamically growing intermediate cache and static weights, respectively.
  We use four LVLM variants of the popular LLaVA framework to present our analysis via integrating various state-of-the-art KV and weight compression methods including uniform, outlier-reduced, and group quantization for the KV cache and weights. With this framework we demonstrate on ten different multi-modal datasets with different capabilities including recognition, knowledge, language generation, spatial awareness, visual reasoning, hallucination and visual illusion identification, toxicity, stereotypes and bias. In specific, our framework demonstrates the compression impact on both general and ethically critical metrics leveraging a combination of real world and synthetic datasets to encompass diverse societal intersectional attributes. Extensive experimental evaluations yield diverse and intriguing observations on the behavior of LVLMs at different quantization budget of KV and weights, in both maintaining and losing performance as compared to the baseline model with FP16 data format.

      <title>Wanda++: Pruning Large Language Models via Regional Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Balcony: A Lightweight Approach to Dynamic Inference of Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is often hindered by strict computational and latency constraints. While dynamic inference offers the flexibility to adjust model behavior based on varying resource budgets, existing methods are frequently limited by hardware inefficiencies or performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Balcony, a simple yet highly effective framework for depth-based dynamic inference. By freezing the pretrained LLM and inserting additional transformer layers at selected exit points, Balcony maintains the full model's performance while enabling real-time adaptation to different computational budgets. These additional layers are trained using a straightforward self-distillation loss, aligning the sub-model outputs with those of the full model. This approach requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters, drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining data, Balcony achieves minimal performance degradation while enabling significant speedups. Remarkably, we show that Balcony outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Flextron and Layerskip as well as other leading compression techniques on multiple models and at various scales, across a variety of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>LLMs' Reshaping of People, Processes, Products, and Society in Software Development: A Comprehensive Exploration with Early Adopters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot are rapidly gaining traction in the software industry, but their full impact on software engineering remains insufficiently explored. Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process - how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements. Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications.</description>

      <title>Continual Pre-training of MoEs: How robust is your router?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are promising architectures for foundation models. Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay and learning rate re-warming and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale (&gt;2B parameter switch and DeepSeek MoE LLMs trained for 600B tokens) empirical study across four MoE transformers to answer these questions. Our results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, we show that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Leveraging Anatomical Landmarks in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.</description>

Abstract: Automata-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) has given promising results for learning multi-task policies capable of performing temporally extended objectives given at runtime, done by pretraining and freezing automata embeddings prior to training the downstream policy. However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-specific Non-Cartesian MRI Reconstruction using Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scanning time for a fully sampled MRI can be undesirably lengthy. Compressed sensing has been developed to minimize image artifacts in accelerated scans, but the required iterative reconstruction is computationally complex and difficult to generalize on new cases. Image-domain-based deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks) emerged as a faster alternative but face challenges in modeling continuous k-space, a problem amplified with non-Cartesian sampling commonly used in accelerated acquisition. In comparison, implicit neural representations can model continuous signals in the frequency domain and thus are compatible with arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The current study develops a novel generative-adversarially trained implicit neural representations (k-GINR) for de novo undersampled non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction. k-GINR consists of two stages: 1) supervised training on an existing patient cohort; 2) self-supervised patient-specific optimization. In stage 1, the network is trained with the generative-adversarial network on diverse patients of the same anatomical region supervised by fully sampled acquisition. In stage 2, undersampled k-space data of individual patients is used to tailor the prior-embedded network for patient-specific optimization. The UCSF StarVIBE T1-weighted liver dataset was evaluated on the proposed framework. k-GINR is compared with an image-domain deep learning method, Deep Cascade CNN, and a compressed sensing method. k-GINR consistently outperformed the baselines with a larger performance advantage observed at very high accelerations (e.g., 20 times). k-GINR offers great value for direct non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction for new incoming patients across a wide range of accelerations liver anatomy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential in robotic manipulation, yet challenges persist in executing complex fine manipulation tasks with high speed and precision. While excelling at high-level planning, existing VLM methods struggle to guide robots through precise sequences of fine motor actions. To address this limitation, we introduce a progressive VLM planning algorithm that empowers robots to perform fast, precise, and error-correctable fine manipulation. Our method decomposes complex tasks into sub-actions and maintains three key data structures: task memory structure, 2D topology graphs, and 3D spatial networks, achieving high-precision spatial-semantic fusion. These three components collectively accumulate and store critical information throughout task execution, providing rich context for our task-oriented VLM interaction mechanism. This enables VLMs to dynamically adjust guidance based on real-time feedback, generating precise action plans and facilitating step-wise error correction. Experimental validation on complex assembly tasks demonstrates that our algorithm effectively guides robots to rapidly and precisely accomplish fine manipulation in challenging scenarios, significantly advancing robot intelligence for precision tasks.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Aware Inference: Mitigating the Straggler Effect in Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an effective architecture for scaling large language models by leveraging sparse expert activation, optimizing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, under expert parallelism, MoE suffers from inference inefficiencies due to imbalanced token-to-expert assignment, where some experts are overloaded while others remain underutilized. This imbalance leads to poor resource utilization and increased latency, as the most burdened expert dictates the overall delay, a phenomenon we define as the \textbf{\textit{Straggler Effect}}. To mitigate this, we propose Capacity-Aware Inference, including two key techniques: (1) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Drop}}, which discards overloaded tokens to regulate the maximum latency of MoE, and (2) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Reroute}}, which reallocates overflowed tokens to underutilized experts, balancing the token distribution. These techniques collectively optimize both high-load and low-load expert utilization, leading to a more efficient MoE inference pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, showing significant improvements in inference efficiency, e.g., 0.2\% average performance increase and a 1.94$\times$ inference speedup on Mixtral-8$\times$7B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>PromptPex: Automatic Test Generation for Language Model Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being used in many applications and prompts for these models are integrated into software applications as code-like artifacts. These prompts behave much like traditional software in that they take inputs, generate outputs, and perform some specific function. However, prompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to ensure that they are robust. For example, unlike traditional software the output of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while natural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to predict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with respect to the model running them are required.
  To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to automatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex extracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to generate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental in identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to understand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to generate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the generated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to produce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in more invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test generator. Furthermore, by extracting concrete specifications from the input prompt, PromptPex allows prompt writers to clearly understand and test specific aspects of their prompts. The source code of PromptPex is available at https://github.com/microsoft/promptpex.</description>

      <title>Object Packing and Scheduling for Sequential 3D Printing: a Linear Arithmetic Model and a CEGAR-inspired Optimal Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of object arrangement and scheduling for sequential 3D printing. Unlike the standard 3D printing, where all objects are printed slice by slice at once, in sequential 3D printing, objects are completed one after other. In the sequential case, it is necessary to ensure that the moving parts of the printer do not collide with previously printed objects. We look at the sequential printing problem from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. We propose to express the problem as a linear arithmetic formula, which is then solved using a solver for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). However, we do not solve the formula expressing the problem of object arrangement and scheduling directly, but we have proposed a technique inspired by counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR), which turned out to be a key innovation to efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Collaboration through Reinforcement Learning and Abstract Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teams of people coordinate to perform complex tasks by forming abstract mental models of world and agent dynamics. The use of abstract models contrasts with much recent work in robot learning that uses a high-fidelity simulator and reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain policies for physical robots. Motivated by this difference, we investigate the extent to which so-called abstract simulators can be used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the resulting policies successfully deployed on teams of physical robots. An abstract simulator models the robot's target task at a high-level of abstraction and discards many details of the world that could impact optimal decision-making. Policies are trained in an abstract simulator then transferred to the physical robot by making use of separately-obtained low-level perception and motion control modules. We identify three key categories of modifications to the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots: simulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation stochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to determine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer in cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies produced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior architecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach leads to a similar level of performance. Broadly we show that MARL can be use to train cooperative physical robot behaviors using highly abstract models of the world.</description>

      <title>Grouped Sequential Optimization Strategy -- the Application of Hyperparameter Importance Assessment in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical component of machine learning pipelines, significantly affecting model robustness, stability, and generalization. However, HPO is often a time-consuming and computationally intensive task. Traditional HPO methods, such as grid search and random search, often suffer from inefficiency. Bayesian optimization, while more efficient, still struggles with high-dimensional search spaces. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring how insights gained from hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can be leveraged to accelerate HPO, reducing both time and computational resources. Building on prior work that quantified hyperparameter importance by evaluating 10 hyperparameters on CNNs using 10 common image classification datasets, we implement a novel HPO strategy called 'Sequential Grouping.' That prior work assessed the importance weights of the investigated hyperparameters based on their influence on model performance, providing valuable insights that we leverage to optimize our HPO process. Our experiments, validated across six additional image classification datasets, demonstrate that incorporating hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can significantly accelerate HPO without compromising model performance, reducing optimization time by an average of 31.9\% compared to the conventional simultaneous strategy.</description>

      <title>TS-LIF: A Temporal Segment Spiking Neuron Network for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising, biologically inspired approach for processing spatiotemporal data, particularly for time series forecasting. However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

      <title>Look Before You Leap: Using Serialized State Machine for Language Conditioned Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning frameworks for robotic manipulation have drawn attention in the recent development of language model grounded robotics. However, the success of the frameworks largely depends on the coverage of the demonstration cases: When the demonstration set does not include examples of how to act in all possible situations, the action may fail and can result in cascading errors. To solve this problem, we propose a framework that uses serialized Finite State Machine (FSM) to generate demonstrations and improve the success rate in manipulation tasks requiring a long sequence of precise interactions. To validate its effectiveness, we use environmentally evolving and long-horizon puzzles that require long sequential actions. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a success rate of up to 98 in these tasks, compared to the controlled condition using existing approaches, which only had a success rate of up to 60, and, in some tasks, almost failed completely.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Enables Parameter Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</description>

      <title>HexPlane Representation for 3D Semantic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the HexPlane representation for 3D semantic scene understanding. Specifically, we first design the View Projection Module (VPM) to project the 3D point cloud into six planes to maximally retain the original spatial information. Features of six planes are extracted by the 2D encoder and sent to the HexPlane Association Module (HAM) to adaptively fuse the most informative information for each point. The fused point features are further fed to the task head to yield the ultimate predictions. Compared to the popular point and voxel representation, the HexPlane representation is efficient and can utilize highly optimized 2D operations to process sparse and unordered 3D point clouds. It can also leverage off-the-shelf 2D models, network weights, and training recipes to achieve accurate scene understanding in 3D space. On ScanNet and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, our algorithm, dubbed HexNet3D, achieves competitive performance with previous algorithms. In particular, on the ScanNet 3D segmentation task, our method obtains 77.0 mIoU on the validation set, surpassing Point Transformer V2 by 1.6 mIoU. We also observe encouraging results in indoor 3D detection tasks. Note that our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing voxel-based, point-based, and range-based approaches and brings considerable gains without bells and whistles. The codes will be available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Every FLOP Counts: Scaling a 300B Mixture-of-Experts LING LLM without Premium GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

Abstract: This research focuses on the development and enhancement of text-to-image denoising diffusion models, addressing key challenges such as limited sample diversity and training instability. By incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques, this study significantly improves image quality, diversity, and stability. Utilizing Hugging Face's state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, the proposed enhancements establish new benchmarks in generative AI. This work explores the underlying principles of diffusion models, implements advanced strategies to overcome existing limitations, and presents a comprehensive evaluation of the improvements achieved.

      <description>arXiv:2503.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluation methods for autonomous driving are crucial for algorithm optimization. However, due to the complexity of driving intelligence, there is currently no comprehensive evaluation method for the level of autonomous driving intelligence. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for driving behavior intelligence in complex traffic environments, aiming to fill this gap. We constructed a natural language evaluation dataset of human professional drivers and passengers through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving behavior evaluation interviews. Based on this dataset, we developed an LLM-powered driving evaluation framework. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through simulated experiments in the CARLA urban traffic simulator and further corroborated by human assessment. Our research provides valuable insights for evaluating and designing more intelligent, human-like autonomous driving agents. The implementation details of the framework and detailed information about the dataset can be found at Github.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in their intermediate outputs, which increases computational overhead. We introduce Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a novel prompting framework that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to minimize token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible framework that can incorporate any custom reasoning paradigms based on cognitive science, and we instantiate it with three such paradigms - Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons - each tailored to different reasoning tasks and selected dynamically via a lightweight routing model. Through comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets with multiple languages and multimodal scenarios, we demonstrate that SoT achieves token reductions of 76% with negligible accuracy impact. In certain domains like mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens.

      <title>FinTMMBench: Benchmarking Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal RAG in Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various data sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In this work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</description>

      <title>Rewarding Curse: Analyze and Mitigate Reward Modeling Issues for LLM Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Explainable Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for enhancing data privacy preservation. Its privacy-preserving nature complicates the explanation of the decision-making processes and the evaluation of the reliability of the generated explanations. In this paper, we propose the Uncertainty-aware eXplainable Federated Learning (UncertainXFL) to address these challenges. It generates explanations for decision-making processes under FL settings and provides information regarding the uncertainty of these explanations. UncertainXFL is the first framework to explicitly offer uncertainty evaluation for explanations within the FL context. Explanatory information is initially generated by the FL clients and then aggregated by the server in a comprehensive and conflict-free manner during FL training. The quality of the explanations, including the uncertainty score and tested validity, guides the FL training process by prioritizing clients with the most reliable explanations through higher weights during model aggregation. Extensive experimental evaluation results demonstrate that UncertainXFL achieves superior model accuracy and explanation accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art model that does not incorporate uncertainty information by 2.71% and 1.77%, respectively. By integrating and quantifying uncertainty in the data into the explanation process, UncertainXFL not only clearly presents the explanation alongside its uncertainty, but also leverages this uncertainty to guide the FL training process, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of the resulting models.</description>

      <title>Deep Muscle EMG construction using A Physics-Integrated Deep Learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromyography (EMG)--based computational musculoskeletal modeling is a non-invasive method for studying musculotendon function, human movement, and neuromuscular control, providing estimates of internal variables like muscle forces and joint torques. However, EMG signals from deeper muscles are often challenging to measure by placing the surface EMG electrodes and unfeasible to measure directly using invasive methods. The restriction to the access of EMG data from deeper muscles poses a considerable obstacle to the broad adoption of EMG-driven modeling techniques. A strategic alternative is to use an estimation algorithm to approximate the missing EMG signals from deeper muscle. A similar strategy is used in physics-informed deep learning, where the features of physical systems are learned without labeled data. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning algorithm, namely the neural musculoskeletal model (NMM), that integrates physics-informed and data-driven deep learning to approximate the EMG signals from the deeper muscles. While data-driven modeling is used to predict the missing EMG signals, physics-based modeling engraves the subject-specific information into the predictions. Experimental verifications on five test subjects are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid framework. The proposed NMM is validated against the joint torque computed from 'OpenSim' software. The predicted deep EMG signals are also compared against the state-of-the-art muscle synergy extrapolation (MSE) approach, where the proposed NMM completely outperforms the existing MSE framework by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Policy Constraint by Only Support Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize a policy by using pre-collected datasets, to maximize cumulative rewards. However, offline reinforcement learning suffers challenges due to the distributional shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to errors when computing Q-values for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To mitigate this issue, policy constraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the distribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the support of the behavior policy. However, current policy constraint methods tend to exhibit excessive conservatism, hindering the policy from further surpassing the behavior policy's performance. In this work, we present Only Support Constraint (OSC) which is derived from maximizing the total probability of learned policy in the support of behavior policy, to address the conservatism of policy constraint. OSC presents a regularization term that only restricts policies to the support without imposing extra constraints on actions within the support. Additionally, to fully harness the performance of the new policy constraints, OSC utilizes a diffusion model to effectively characterize the support of behavior policies. Experimental evaluations across a variety of offline RL benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly enhances performance, alleviating the challenges associated with distributional shifts and mitigating conservatism of policy constraints.

      <title>Knowledge Updating? No More Model Editing! Just Selective Contextual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As real-world knowledge evolves, the information embedded within large language models (LLMs) can become outdated, inadequate, or erroneous. Model editing has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with minimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically identifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired knowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects that parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More critically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and continuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these shortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that all ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across multiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then propose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR), for knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses LLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated knowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query falls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant external knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise, the query is answered directly. We evaluate SCR against the ten model editing methods on two counterfactual datasets with three backbone LLMs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of contextual reasoning for knowledge updating.</description>

      <title>Deep Sequence Models for Predicting Average Shear Wave Velocity from Strong Motion Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of deep learning for predicting the time averaged shear wave velocity in the top 30 m of the subsurface ($V_{s30}$) at strong motion recording stations in T\"urkiye. $V_{s30}$ is a key parameter in site characterization and, as a result for seismic hazard assessment. However, it is often unavailable due to the lack of direct measurements and is therefore estimated using empirical correlations. Such correlations however are commonly inadequate in capturing complex, site-specific variability and this motivates the need for data-driven approaches. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in strong motion records. Furthermore, we explore how using different parts of the signal influence our deep learning model. Our results suggest that the hybrid approach effectively learns complex, nonlinear relationships within seismic signals. We observed that an improved P-wave arrival time model increased the prediction accuracy of $V_{s30}$. We believe the study provides valuable insights into improving $V_{s30}$ predictions using a CNN-LSTM framework, demonstrating its potential for improving site characterization for seismic studies.

      <title>Reward-Centered ReST-MCTS: A Robust Decision-Making Framework for Robotic Manipulation in High Uncertainty Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful tool for decision-making in robotics, enabling efficient exploration of large search spaces. However, traditional MCTS methods struggle in environments characterized by high uncertainty and noisy data due to their reliance on final-step reward evaluation. The lack of intermediate feedback during search often results in suboptimal decision-making and computational inefficiencies.
  This paper introduces Reward-Centered ReST-MCTS, a novel framework that enhances MCTS by incorporating intermediate reward shaping. The core of our approach is the Rewarding Center, which refines search trajectories by dynamically assigning partial rewards using rule-based validation, heuristic guidance, and neural estimation. By integrating these mechanisms, our method enables real-time optimization of search paths, mitigating the effects of error propagation.
  We evaluate Reward-Centered ReST-MCTS in robotic manipulation tasks under high uncertainty, demonstrating consistent improvements in decision accuracy. Compared to baseline methods, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Vanilla ReST-MCTS, our framework achieves a 2-4% accuracy improvement while maintaining computational feasibility. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of intermediate feedback in search refinement, particularly in pruning incorrect decision paths early. Furthermore, robustness tests show that our method retains high performance across varying levels of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MOHPER: Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization Framework for E-commerce Retrieval System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce search optimization has evolved to include a wider range of metrics that reflect user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Utilizing Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes both CTR, CTCVR, and relevant objectives, focusing on engagement and conversion of the users. In addition, to improve the selection of the best configuration from multi-objective optimization, we suggest advanced methods for hyperparameter selection, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optimal configurations, to improve speeds of training and efficiency. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to perform accurate and rich simulations of human driving behaviors from data for autonomous vehicle testing remains challenging due to human driving styles' high diversity and variance. We address this challenge by proposing a novel approach that leverages contrastive learning to extract a dictionary of driving styles from pre-existing human driving data. We discretize these styles with quantization, and the styles are used to learn a conditional diffusion policy for simulating human drivers. Our empirical evaluation confirms that the behaviors generated by our approach are both safer and more human-like than those of the machine-learning-based baseline methods. We believe this has the potential to enable higher realism and more effective techniques for evaluating and improving the performance of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Robust Conformal Prediction with a Single Binary Certificate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) converts any model's output to prediction sets with a guarantee to cover the true label with (adjustable) high probability. Robust CP extends this guarantee to worst-case (adversarial) inputs. Existing baselines achieve robustness by bounding randomly smoothed conformity scores. In practice, they need expensive Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling (e.g. $\sim10^4$ samples per point) to maintain an acceptable set size. We propose a robust conformal prediction that produces smaller sets even with significantly lower MC samples (e.g. 150 for CIFAR10). Our approach binarizes samples with an adjustable (or automatically adjusted) threshold selected to preserve the coverage guarantee. Remarkably, we prove that robustness can be achieved by computing only one binary certificate, unlike previous methods that certify each calibration (or test) point. Thus, our method is faster and returns smaller robust sets. We also eliminate a previous limitation that requires a bounded score function.</description>

      <title>A Map-free Deep Learning-based Framework for Gate-to-Gate Monocular Visual Navigation aboard Miniaturized Aerial Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palm-sized autonomous nano-drones, i.e., sub-50g in weight, recently entered the drone racing scenario, where they are tasked to avoid obstacles and navigate as fast as possible through gates. However, in contrast with their bigger counterparts, i.e., kg-scale drones, nano-drones expose three orders of magnitude less onboard memory and compute power, demanding more efficient and lightweight vision-based pipelines to win the race. This work presents a map-free vision-based (using only a monocular camera) autonomous nano-drone that combines a real-time deep learning gate detection front-end with a classic yet elegant and effective visual servoing control back-end, only relying on onboard resources. Starting from two state-of-the-art tiny deep learning models, we adapt them for our specific task, and after a mixed simulator-real-world training, we integrate and deploy them aboard our nano-drone. Our best-performing pipeline costs of only 24M multiply-accumulate operations per frame, resulting in a closed-loop control performance of 30 Hz, while achieving a gate detection root mean square error of 1.4 pixels, on our ~20k real-world image dataset. In-field experiments highlight the capability of our nano-drone to successfully navigate through 15 gates in 4 min, never crashing and covering a total travel distance of ~100m, with a peak flight speed of 1.9 m/s. Finally, to stress the generalization capability of our system, we also test it in a never-seen-before environment, where it navigates through gates for more than 4 min.</description>

Unlike current approaches -- which rely on complex prompt engineering and computationally intensive optimization -- CCA exploits a fundamental architectural vulnerability inherent in many deployed AI systems. By subtly manipulating conversation history, CCA convinces the model to comply with a fabricated dialogue context, thereby triggering restricted behavior. Our evaluation across a diverse set of open-source and proprietary models demonstrates that this simple attack can circumvent state-of-the-art safety protocols. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose practical mitigation strategies to fortify AI systems against such elementary yet effective adversarial tactics.</description>

      <title>PhiloBERTA: A Transformer-Based Cross-Lingual Analysis of Greek and Latin Lexicons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PhiloBERTA, a cross-lingual transformer model that measures semantic relationships between ancient Greek and Latin lexicons. Through analysis of selected term pairs from classical texts, we use contextual embeddings and angular similarity metrics to identify precise semantic alignments. Our results show that etymologically related pairs demonstrate significantly higher similarity scores, particularly for abstract philosophical concepts such as epist\=em\=e (scientia) and dikaiosyn\=e (iustitia). Statistical analysis reveals consistent patterns in these relationships (p = 0.012), with etymologically related pairs showing remarkably stable semantic preservation compared to control pairs. These findings establish a quantitative framework for examining how philosophical concepts moved between Greek and Latin traditions, offering new methods for classical philological research.</description>

      <title>Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Frequency Autoregressive Image Generation with Continuous Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models for image generation typically adopt a two-stage paradigm of vector quantization and raster-scan ``next-token prediction", inspired by its great success in language modeling. However, due to the huge modality gap, image autoregressive models may require a systematic reevaluation from two perspectives: tokenizer format and regression direction. In this paper, we introduce the frequency progressive autoregressive (\textbf{FAR}) paradigm and instantiate FAR with the continuous tokenizer. Specifically, we identify spectral dependency as the desirable regression direction for FAR, wherein higher-frequency components build upon the lower one to progressively construct a complete image. This design seamlessly fits the causality requirement for autoregressive models and preserves the unique spatial locality of image data. Besides, we delve into the integration of FAR and the continuous tokenizer, introducing a series of techniques to address optimization challenges and improve the efficiency of training and inference processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of FAR through comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset and verify its potential on text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Policy Optimization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning is based on pre-collected preference feedback over pairs of trajectories. While offline PbRL has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, existing theoretical approaches face challenges in ensuring conservatism under uncertainty, requiring computationally intractable confidence set constructions. We address this limitation by proposing Adversarial Preference-based Policy Optimization (APPO), a computationally efficient algorithm for offline PbRL that guarantees sample complexity bounds without relying on explicit confidence sets. By framing PbRL as a two-player game between a policy and a model, our approach enforces conservatism in a tractable manner. Using standard assumptions on function approximation and bounded trajectory concentrability, we derive a sample complexity bound. To our knowledge, APPO is the first offline PbRL algorithm to offer both statistical efficiency and practical applicability. Experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate that APPO effectively learns from complex datasets, showing comparable performance with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Decoding with Minimum Bayes Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their outstanding performance in the majority of scenarios, contemporary language models still occasionally generate undesirable outputs, for example, hallucinated text. While such behaviors have previously been linked to uncertainty, there is a notable lack of methods that actively consider uncertainty during text generation. In this work, we show how Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which selects model generations according to an expected risk, can be generalized into a principled uncertainty-aware decoding method. In short, we account for model uncertainty during decoding by incorporating a posterior over model parameters into MBR's computation of expected risk. We show that this modified expected risk is useful for both choosing outputs and deciding when to abstain from generation and can provide improvements without incurring overhead. We benchmark different methods for learning posteriors and show that performance improves with prediction diversity. We release our code publicly.</description>

      <title>Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Task Interference within Neurons: Model Merging in Alignment with Neuronal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on targeted datasets enhances task-specific performance but often comes at the expense of generalization. Model merging techniques, which integrate multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model through task arithmetic at various levels: model, layer, or parameter, offer a promising solution. However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlook the fundamental role of individual neurons and their connectivity, resulting in a lack of interpretability in both the merging process and the merged models. In this work, we present the first study on the impact of neuronal alignment in model merging. We decompose task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate neuron sensitivity and input adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduce NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NeuroMerging achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on multi-task benchmarks across both vision and natural language domains. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning neuronal mechanisms in model merging, offering new insights into mitigating task interference and improving knowledge fusion.</description>

      <title>Attenuation artifact detection and severity classification in intracoronary OCT using mixed image representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT), blood residues and gas bubbles cause attenuation artifacts that can obscure critical vessel structures. The presence and severity of these artifacts may warrant re-acquisition, prolonging procedure time and increasing use of contrast agent. Accurate detection of these artifacts can guide targeted re-acquisition, reducing the amount of repeated scans needed to achieve diagnostically viable images. However, the highly heterogeneous appearance of these artifacts poses a challenge for the automated detection of the affected image regions. To enable automatic detection of the attenuation artifacts caused by blood residues and gas bubbles based on their severity, we propose a convolutional neural network that performs classification of the attenuation lines (A-lines) into three classes: no artifact, mild artifact and severe artifact. Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel speculative decoding method tailored for multi-sample reasoning scenarios, such as self-consistency and Best-of-N sampling. Our method exploits the intrinsic consensus of parallel generation paths to synthesize high-quality draft tokens without requiring auxiliary models or external databases. By dynamically analyzing structural patterns across parallel reasoning paths through a probabilistic aggregation mechanism, it identifies consensus token sequences that align with the decoding distribution. Evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate a substantial improvement in draft acceptance rates over baselines, while reducing the latency in draft token construction. This work establishes a paradigm shift for efficient multi-sample inference, enabling seamless integration of speculative decoding with sampling-based reasoning techniques.</description>

      <title>AutoIOT: LLM-Driven Automated Natural Language Programming for AIoT Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Spatial Distillation based Distribution Alignment (SDDA) for Cross-Headset EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Logical Content of Logic Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic programming (LP) is typically understood through operational semantics (e.g., SLD-resolution) or model-theoretic interpretations (e.g., the least Herbrand model). This paper introduces a novel perspective on LP by defining a ``support'' relation that explicates what a program ``knows''. This interpretation is shown to express classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as an intermediate logic, depending on certain choices regarding LP and the meanings of disjunction and negation. These results are formalized using the idea of base-extension semantics within proof-theoretic semantics. Our approach offers new insights into the logical foundations of LP and has potential applications in knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and formal verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic hate speech detection faces significant challenges due to the diverse definitions and datasets used in research and practice. Social media platforms, legal frameworks, and institutions each apply distinct yet overlapping definitions, complicating classification efforts. This study addresses these challenges by demonstrating that existing datasets and taxonomies can be integrated into a unified model, enhancing prediction performance and reducing reliance on multiple specialized classifiers. The work introduces a universal taxonomy and a hate speech classifier capable of detecting a wide range of definitions within a single framework. Our approach is validated by combining two widely used but differently annotated datasets, showing improved classification performance on an independent test set. This work highlights the potential of dataset and taxonomy integration in advancing hate speech detection, increasing efficiency, and ensuring broader applicability across contexts.</description>

      <title>Shifting Perspectives: Steering Vector Ensembles for Robust Bias Mitigation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</description>

      <title>Static Program Analysis Guided LLM Based Unit Test Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel approach to automating unit test generation for Java methods using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches rely on sample usage(s) of the method to test (focal method) and/or provide the entire class of the focal method as input prompt and context. The former approach is often not viable due to the lack of sample usages, especially for newly written focal methods. The latter approach does not scale well enough; the bigger the complexity of the focal method and larger associated class, the harder it is to produce adequate test code (due to factors such as exceeding the prompt and context lengths of the underlying LLM). We show that augmenting prompts with \emph{concise} and \emph{precise} context information obtained by program analysis %of the focal method increases the effectiveness of generating unit test code through LLMs. We validate our approach on a large commercial Java project and a popular open-source Java project.</description>

      <title>Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Conformal Prediction in LLM with ASP Scaffolds for Robust Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the use of Conformal Language Modelling (CLM) alongside Answer Set Programming (ASP) to enhance the performance of standard open-weight LLMs on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Using the StepGame dataset, which requires spatial reasoning, we apply CLM to generate sets of ASP programs from an LLM, providing statistical guarantees on the correctness of the outputs. Experimental results show that CLM significantly outperforms baseline models that use standard sampling methods, achieving substantial accuracy improvements across different levels of reasoning complexity. Additionally, the LLM-as-Judge metric enhances CLM's performance, especially in assessing structurally and logically correct ASP outputs. However, calibrating CLM with diverse calibration sets did not improve generalizability for tasks requiring much longer reasoning steps, indicating limitations in handling more complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Linear-MoE: Linear Sequence Modeling Meets Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Sequence Modeling (LSM) like linear attention, state space models and linear RNNs, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have recently emerged as significant architectural improvements. In this paper, we introduce Linear-MoE, a production-level system for modeling and training large-scale models that integrate LSM with MoE. Linear-MoE leverages the advantages of both LSM modules for linear-complexity sequence modeling and MoE layers for sparsely activation, aiming to offer high performance with efficient training. The Linear-MoE system comprises: 1) Modeling subsystem, which provides a unified framework supporting all instances of LSM. and 2) Training subsystem, which facilitates efficient training by incorporating various advanced parallelism technologies, particularly Sequence Parallelism designed for Linear-MoE models. Additionally, we explore hybrid models that combine Linear-MoE layers with standard Transformer-MoE layers with its Sequence Parallelism to further enhance model flexibility and performance. Evaluations on two model series, A0.3B-2B and A1B-7B, demonstrate Linear-MoE achieves efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance on various benchmarks, showcasing its potential as a next-generation foundational model architecture.

      <description>arXiv:2503.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to domain-specific metamodel construction relying on Large Language Model (LLM). The main focus is adoption in automotive domain. As outcome, a prototype was implemented as web service using Python programming language, while OpenAI's GPT-4o was used as the underlying LLM. Based on the initial experiments, this approach successfully constructs Ecore metamodel based on set of automotive requirements and visualizes it making use of PlantUML notation, so human experts can provide feedback in order to refine the result. Finally, locally deployable solution is also considered, including the limitations and additional steps required.</description>

      <title>Soft Policy Optimization: Online Off-Policy RL for Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RL-based post-training of language models is almost exclusively done using on-policy methods such as PPO. These methods cannot learn from arbitrary sequences such as those produced earlier in training, in earlier runs, by human experts or other policies, or by decoding and exploration methods. This results in severe sample inefficiency and exploration difficulties, as well as a potential loss of diversity in the policy responses. Moreover, asynchronous PPO implementations require frequent and costly model transfers, and typically use value models which require a large amount of memory. In this paper we introduce Soft Policy Optimization (SPO), a simple, scalable and principled Soft RL method for sequence model policies that can learn from arbitrary online and offline trajectories and does not require a separate value model. In experiments on code contests, we shows that SPO outperforms PPO on pass@10, is significantly faster and more memory efficient, is able to benefit from off-policy data, enjoys improved stability, and learns more diverse (i.e. soft) policies.</description>

      <title>Controllable Complementarity: Subjective Preferences in Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on human-AI collaboration often prioritizes objective performance. However, understanding human subjective preferences is essential to improving human-AI complementarity and human experiences. We investigate human preferences for controllability in a shared workspace task with AI partners using Behavior Shaping (BS), a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows humans explicit control over AI behavior.
  In one experiment, we validate the robustness of BS in producing effective AI policies relative to self-play policies, when controls are hidden. In another experiment, we enable human control, showing that participants perceive AI partners as more effective and enjoyable when they can directly dictate AI behavior. Our findings highlight the need to design AI that prioritizes both task performance and subjective human preferences. By aligning AI behavior with human preferences, we demonstrate how human-AI complementarity can extend beyond objective outcomes to include subjective preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems address issues of accessibility and scalability of artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, which are often represented by large language models. We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning via Learning Dynamic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to train a personalized model for each client that is tailored to its local data distribution, learning fails to perform well on individual clients due to variations in their local data distributions. Most existing PFL methods focus on personalizing the aggregated global model for each client, neglecting the fundamental aspect of federated learning: the regulation of how client models are aggregated. Additionally, almost all of them overlook the graph structure formed by clients in federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Personalized Federated Learning with Graph Attention Network (pFedGAT), which captures the latent graph structure between clients and dynamically determines the importance of other clients for each client, enabling fine-grained control over the aggregation process. We evaluate pFedGAT across multiple data distribution scenarios, comparing it with twelve state of the art methods on three datasets: Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, and find that it consistently performs well.</description>

      <title>FastMap: Fast Queries Initialization Based Vectorized HD Map Reconstruction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of high-definition maps is a crucial task in perceiving the autonomous driving environment, as its accuracy directly impacts the reliability of prediction and planning capabilities in downstream modules. Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure, necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding. Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline. Code and more demos are available at https://github.com/hht1996ok/FastMap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose multilingual vector representations, used in retrieval, regression and classification, are traditionally obtained from bidirectional encoder models. Despite their wide applicability, encoders have been recently overshadowed by advances in generative decoder-only models. However, many innovations driving this progress are not inherently tied to decoders. In this paper, we revisit the development of multilingual encoders through the lens of these advances, and introduce EuroBERT, a family of multilingual encoders covering European and widely spoken global languages. Our models outperform existing alternatives across a diverse range of tasks, spanning multilingual capabilities, mathematics, and coding, and natively supporting sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. We also examine the design decisions behind EuroBERT, offering insights into our dataset composition and training pipeline. We publicly release the EuroBERT models, including intermediate training checkpoints, together with our training framework.</description>

      <title>Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents increasing challenges due to their limited computational and energy resources. Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) emerges as a promising authentication technique to identify wireless devices through hardware impairments. RFFI performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios is significantly degraded because the minute hardware features can be easily swamped in noise. In this paper, we leveraged the diffusion model to effectively restore the RFF under low SNR scenarios. Specifically, we trained a powerful noise predictor and tailored a noise removal algorithm to effectively reduce the noise level in the received signal and restore the device fingerprints. We used Wi-Fi as a case study and created a testbed involving 6 commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi dongles and a USRP N210 software-defined radio (SDR) platform. We conducted experimental evaluations on various SNR scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the classification accuracy by up to 34.9%.</description>

Abstract: Cognitive biases, systematic deviations from rationality in judgment, pose significant challenges in generating objective content. This paper introduces a novel approach for real-time cognitive bias detection in user-generated text using large language models (LLMs) and advanced prompt engineering techniques. The proposed system analyzes textual data to identify common cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, circular reasoning, and hidden assumption. By designing tailored prompts, the system effectively leverages LLMs' capabilities to both recognize and mitigate these biases, improving the quality of human-generated content (e.g., news, media, reports). Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach in identifying cognitive biases, offering a valuable tool for enhancing content objectivity and reducing the risks of biased decision-making.</description>

      <title>Post-Hoc Concept Disentanglement: From Correlated to Isolated Concept Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are widely used to model human-understandable concepts as directions within the latent space of neural networks. They are trained by identifying directions from the activations of concept samples to those of non-concept samples. However, this method often produces similar, non-orthogonal directions for correlated concepts, such as "beard" and "necktie" within the CelebA dataset, which frequently co-occur in images of men. This entanglement complicates the interpretation of concepts in isolation and can lead to undesired effects in CAV applications, such as activation steering. To address this issue, we introduce a post-hoc concept disentanglement method that employs a non-orthogonality loss, facilitating the identification of orthogonal concept directions while preserving directional correctness. We evaluate our approach with real-world and controlled correlated concepts in CelebA and a synthetic FunnyBirds dataset with VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures. We further demonstrate the superiority of orthogonalized concept representations in activation steering tasks, allowing (1) the insertion of isolated concepts into input images through generative models and (2) the removal of concepts for effective shortcut suppression with reduced impact on correlated concepts in comparison to baseline CAVs.</description>

      <title>Impoola: The Power of Average Pooling for Image-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As image-based deep reinforcement learning tackles more challenging tasks, increasing model size has become an important factor in improving performance. Recent studies achieved this by focusing on the parameter efficiency of scaled networks, typically using Impala-CNN, a 15-layer ResNet-inspired network, as the image encoder. However, while Impala-CNN evidently outperforms older CNN architectures, potential advancements in network design for deep reinforcement learning-specific image encoders remain largely unexplored. We find that replacing the flattening of output feature maps in Impala-CNN with global average pooling leads to a notable performance improvement. This approach outperforms larger and more complex models in the Procgen Benchmark, particularly in terms of generalization. We call our proposed encoder model Impoola-CNN. A decrease in the network's translation sensitivity may be central to this improvement, as we observe the most significant gains in games without agent-centered observations. Our results demonstrate that network scaling is not just about increasing model size - efficient network design is also an essential factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in various fields requires solid concepts to ensure compliance with upcoming legislation. This paper systematically examines the compliance of AI systems with relevant legislation, focusing on the EU's AI Act and the compliance of data sets. The analysis highlighted many challenges associated with edge devices, which are increasingly being used to deploy AI applications closer and closer to the data sources. Such devices often face unique issues due to their decentralized nature and limited computing resources for implementing sophisticated compliance mechanisms. By analyzing AI implementations, the paper identifies challenges and proposes the first best practices for legal compliance when developing, deploying, and running AI. The importance of data set compliance is highlighted as a cornerstone for ensuring the trustworthiness, transparency, and explainability of AI systems, which must be aligned with ethical standards set forth in regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. The insights gained should contribute to the ongoing discourse on the responsible development and deployment of embedded AI systems.</description>

      <title>InDRiVE: Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration through Curiosity Driven Generalized World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where data efficiency and robustness are critical. Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Against Spurious Features in Grounding Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness has become a critical attribute for the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit noise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a. implicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes. Extensive evaluation results across multiple LLMs suggest that spurious features are a widespread and challenging problem in the field of RAG. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research. We release all codes and data at: $\\\href{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}{https://github.com/maybenotime/RAG-SpuriousFeatures}$.</description>

      <title>CACTUS: An Open Dataset and Framework for Automated Cardiac Assessment and Classification of Ultrasound Images Using Deep Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) scanning is a commonly used techniques in cardiology to diagnose the health of the heart and its proper functioning. Therefore, it is necessary to consider ways to automate these tasks and assist medical professionals in classifying and assessing cardiac US images. Machine learning (ML) techniques are regarded as a prominent solution due to their success in numerous applications aimed at enhancing the medical field, including addressing the shortage of echography technicians. However, the limited availability of medical data presents a significant barrier to applying ML in cardiology, particularly regarding US images of the heart. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing the first open graded dataset for Cardiac Assessment and ClassificaTion of UltraSound (CACTUS), which is available online. This dataset contains images obtained from scanning a CAE Blue Phantom and representing various heart views and different quality levels, exceeding the conventional cardiac views typically found in the literature. Additionally, the paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL) framework consisting of two main components. The first component classifies cardiac US images based on the heart view using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The second component uses Transfer Learning (TL) to fine-tune the knowledge from the first component and create a model for grading and assessing cardiac images. The framework demonstrates high performance in both classification and grading, achieving up to 99.43% accuracy and as low as 0.3067 error, respectively. To showcase its robustness, the framework is further fine-tuned using new images representing additional cardiac views and compared to several other state-of-the-art architectures. The framework's outcomes and performance in handling real-time scans were also assessed using a questionnaire answered by cardiac experts.</description>

      <title>AceWGS: An LLM-Aided Framework to Accelerate Catalyst Design for Water-Gas Shift Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Water-Gas Shift (WGS) reaction plays a crucial role in hydrogen production for fuel cells, finding suitable catalysts to achieve high yields for low-temperature WGS reactions remains a persistent challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promise in accelerating catalyst design by exploring vast candidate spaces, however, two key gaps limit its effectiveness. First, AI models primarily train on numerical data, which fail to capture essential text-based information, such as catalyst synthesis methods. Second, the cross-disciplinary nature of catalyst design requires seamless collaboration between AI, theory, experiments, and numerical simulations, often leading to communication barriers. To address these gaps, we present AceWGS, a Large Language Models (LLMs)-aided framework to streamline WGS catalyst design. AceWGS interacts with researchers through natural language, answering queries based on four features: (i) answering general queries, (ii) extracting information about the database comprising WGS-related journal articles, (iii) comprehending the context described in these articles, and (iv) identifying catalyst candidates using our proposed AI inverse model. We presented a practical case study demonstrating how AceWGS can accelerate the catalyst design process. AceWGS, built with open-source tools, offers an adjustable framework that researchers can readily adapt for a range of AI-accelerated catalyst design applications, supporting seamless integration across cross-disciplinary studies.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Sparse Autoencoders: Interpreting the Internal Mechanisms of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models. Despite the challenges that remain around SAE implementation and scaling, they continue to provide valuable tools for understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models.</description>

      <title>Learning LLM Preference over Intra-Dialogue Pairs: A Framework for Utterance-level Understandings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex dialogue tasks without requiring use case-specific fine-tuning. However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates low-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with billions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners often prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on high-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the scalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations, enabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy comparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for per-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent detection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of labeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student models -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy across utterance-level dialogue tasks, including sentiment detection (over $2\%$), dialogue act classification (over $1.5\%$), etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy through medical image analysis for pneumonia diagnosis. However, traditional multimodal approaches often fail to address real-world challenges such as incomplete data and modality loss. In this study, a Flexible Multimodal Transformer (FMT) was proposed, which uses ResNet-50 and BERT for joint representation learning, followed by a dynamic masked attention strategy that simulates clinical modality loss to improve robustness; finally, a sequential mixture of experts (MOE) architecture was used to achieve multi-level decision refinement. After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1 score, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the medical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal diagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings.</description>

      <title>Superintelligence Strategy: Expert Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in AI are beginning to reshape national security. Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence -- AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks -- is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state's aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project -- through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters -- MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead.</description>

      <title>Exploring FMCW Radars and Feature Maps for Activity Recognition: A Benchmark Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition has gained significant attention due to its diverse applications, including ambient assisted living and remote sensing. Wearable sensor-based solutions often suffer from user discomfort and reliability issues, while video-based methods raise privacy concerns and perform poorly in low-light conditions or long ranges. This study introduces a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radar-based framework for human activity recognition, leveraging a 60 GHz radar and multi-dimensional feature maps. Unlike conventional approaches that process feature maps as images, this study feeds multi-dimensional feature maps -- Range-Doppler, Range-Azimuth, and Range-Elevation -- as data vectors directly into the machine learning (SVM, MLP) and deep learning (CNN, LSTM, ConvLSTM) models, preserving the spatial and temporal structures of the data. These features were extracted from a novel dataset with seven activity classes and validated using two different validation approaches. The ConvLSTM model outperformed conventional machine learning and deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 90.51% and an F1-score of 87.31% on cross-scene validation and an accuracy of 89.56% and an F1-score of 87.15% on leave-one-person-out cross-validation. The results highlight the approach's potential for scalable, non-intrusive, and privacy-preserving activity monitoring in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present TrajectoryCrafter, a novel approach to redirect camera trajectories for monocular videos. By disentangling deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, our method achieves precise control over user-specified camera trajectories. We propose a novel dual-stream conditional video diffusion model that concurrently integrates point cloud renders and source videos as conditions, ensuring accurate view transformations and coherent 4D content generation. Instead of leveraging scarce multi-view videos, we curate a hybrid training dataset combining web-scale monocular videos with static multi-view datasets, by our innovative double-reprojection strategy, significantly fostering robust generalization across diverse scenes. Extensive evaluations on multi-view and large-scale monocular videos demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</description>

      <title>VideoPainter: Any-length Video Inpainting and Editing with Plug-and-Play Context Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</description>

      <title>dARt Vinci: Egocentric Data Collection for Surgical Robot Learning at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity has long been an issue in the robot learning community. Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously. We introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings. The system uses Augmented Reality (AR) hand tracking and a high-fidelity physics engine to capture subtle maneuvers in primitive surgical tasks: By eliminating the need for a physical robot setup and providing flexibility in terms of time, space, and hardware resources-such as multiview sensors and actuators-specialized simulation is a viable alternative. At the same time, AR allows the robot data collection to be more egocentric, supported by its body tracking and content overlaying capabilities. Our user study confirms the proposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive tasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput improves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average. The total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%. The temporal demand in the task load survey is improved. These gains are statistically significant. Additionally, the collected data is over 400 times smaller in size, requiring far less storage while achieving double the frequency.</description>

      <title>BEHAVIOR Robot Suite: Streamlining Real-World Whole-Body Manipulation for Everyday Household Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks. BRS is open-sourced at https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Policy Gradient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require large amounts of data, prohibiting their use in applications where frequent interactions with operational systems are infeasible, or high-fidelity simulations are expensive or unavailable. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order models, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct sim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance estimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when target-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward and improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use high-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more high-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target environment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe that MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity environment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</description>

      <title>Direct Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization with Dueling Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization problems find widespread use in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios. In practical applications, users aspire for solutions that converge to the region of interest (ROI) along the Pareto front (PF). While the conventional approach involves approximating a fitness function or an objective function to reflect user preferences, this paper explores an alternative avenue. Specifically, we aim to discover a method that sidesteps the need for calculating the fitness function, relying solely on human feedback. Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning facilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is structured into three sessions. Firstly, we assess the performance of our active dueling bandit algorithm. Secondly, we implement our proposed method within the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Finally, we deploy our method in a practical problem, specifically in protein structure prediction (PSP). This research presents a novel interactive preference-based MOEA framework that not only addresses the limitations of traditional techniques but also unveils new possibilities for optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Planning Domain Model Acquisition from State Traces without Action Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing planning action domain model acquisition approaches consider different types of state traces from which they learn. The differences in state traces refer to the level of observability of state changes (from full to none) and whether the observations have some noise (the state changes might be inaccurately logged). However, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing approaches consider state traces in which each state change corresponds to an action specified by its name and all its parameters (all objects that are relevant to the action). Furthermore, the names and types of all the parameters of the actions to be learned are given. These assumptions are too strong.
  In this paper, we propose a method that learns action schema from state traces with fully observable state changes but without the parameters of actions responsible for the state changes (only action names are part of the state traces). Although we can easily deduce the number (and names) of the actions that will be in the learned domain model, we still need to deduce the number and types of the parameters of each action alongside its precondition and effects. We show that this task is at least as hard as graph isomorphism. However, our experimental evaluation on a large collection of IPC benchmarks shows that our approach is still practical as the number of required parameters is usually small.
  Compared to the state-of-the-art learning tools SAM and Extended SAM our new algorithm is able to provide better results in multiple domains in terms of learning action models more similar to reference models, even though it uses less information and has fewer restrictions on the input traces.</description>

      <title>Open Role-Playing with Delta-Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game roles can be reflections of personas from a parallel world. In this paper, we propose a new style of game-play to bridge self-expression and role-playing: \emph{open role-playing games (ORPGs)}, where players are allowed to craft and embody their unique characters in the game world. Our vision is that, in the real world, we are individually similar when we are born, but we grow into unique ones as a result of the strongly different choices we make afterward. Therefore, in an ORPG, we empower players with freedom to decide their own growing curves through natural language inputs, ultimately becoming unique characters. To technically do this, we propose a special engine called Delta-Engine. This engine is not a traditional game engine used for game development, but serves as an in-game module to provide new game-play experiences. A delta-engine consists of two components, a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the character as well as the foundational settings of the game; the neural proxy is an LLM, which realizes the character growth by generating new code snippets on the base engine incrementally. In this paper, we self-develop a specific ORPG based on delta-engines. It is adapted from the popular animated series ``Pok\'emon''. We present our efforts in generating out-of-domain and interesting role data in the development process as well as accessing the performance of a delta-engine. While the empirical results in this work are specific, we aim for them to provide general insights for future games.</description>

      <title>SynSUM -- Synthetic Benchmark with Structured and Unstructured Medical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the SynSUM benchmark, a synthetic dataset linking unstructured clinical notes to structured background variables. The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. We conduct both an expert evaluation study to assess the quality of the generated notes, as well as running some simple predictor models on both the tabular and text portions of the dataset, forming a baseline for further research. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>BuildingView: Constructing Urban Building Exteriors Databases with Street View Imagery and Multimodal Large Language Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban Building Exteriors are increasingly important in urban analytics, driven by advancements in Street View Imagery and its integration with urban research. Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful tools for urban annotation, enabling deeper insights into urban environments. However, challenges remain in creating accurate and detailed urban building exterior databases, identifying critical indicators for energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and human-centric design, and systematically organizing these indicators. To address these challenges, we propose BuildingView, a novel approach that integrates high-resolution visual data from Google Street View with spatial information from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This research improves the accuracy of urban building exterior data, identifies key sustainability and design indicators, and develops a framework for their extraction and categorization. Our methodology includes a systematic literature review, building and Street View sampling, and annotation using the ChatGPT-4O API. The resulting database, validated with data from New York City, Amsterdam, and Singapore, provides a comprehensive tool for urban studies, supporting informed decision-making in urban planning, architectural design, and environmental policy. The code for BuildingView is available at https://github.com/Jasper0122/BuildingView.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>

      <title>NavRAG: Generating User Demand Instructions for Embodied Navigation through Retrieval-Augmented LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</description>

      <title>NeSyC: A Neuro-symbolic Continual Learner For Complex Embodied Tasks In Open Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore neuro-symbolic approaches to generalize actionable knowledge, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks more effectively in open-domain environments. A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains. Experiments conducted on diverse embodied task benchmarks-including ALFWorld, VirtualHome, Minecraft, RLBench, and a real-world robotic scenario-demonstrate that NeSyC is highly effective in solving complex embodied tasks across a range of open-domain environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a question-image input, the Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) model can predict an answer with the corresponding rationale, which requires inference ability from the real world. The VCR task, which calls for exploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of understanding and extensive commonsense knowledge, is a cognition-level scene understanding task. The VCR task has aroused researchers' interest due to its wide range of applications, including visual question answering, automated vehicle systems, and clinical decision support. Previous approaches to solving the VCR task generally rely on pre-training or exploiting memory with long dependency relationship encoded models. However, these approaches suffer from a lack of generalizability and losing information in long sequences. In this paper, we propose a parallel attention-based cognitive VCR network PAVCR, which fuses visual-textual information efficiently and encodes semantic information in parallel to enable the model to capture rich information for cognition-level inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model yields significant improvements over existing methods on the benchmark VCR dataset. Moreover, the proposed model provides intuitive interpretation into visual commonsense reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on social bots aims at advancing knowledge and providing solutions to one of the most debated forms of online manipulation. Yet, social bot research is plagued by widespread biases, hyped results, and misconceptions that set the stage for ambiguities, unrealistic expectations, and seemingly irreconcilable findings. Overcoming such issues is instrumental towards ensuring reliable solutions and reaffirming the validity of the scientific method. In this contribution, we review some recent results in social bots research, highlighting and revising factual errors as well as methodological and conceptual biases. More importantly, we demystify common misconceptions, addressing fundamental points on how social bots research is discussed. Our analysis surfaces the need to discuss research about online disinformation and manipulation in a rigorous, unbiased, and responsible way. This article bolsters such effort by identifying and refuting common fallacious arguments used by both proponents and opponents of social bots research, as well as providing directions toward sound methodologies for future research in the field.</description>

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>EdgeMoE: Empowering Sparse Large Language Models on Mobile Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs and Mixtral-8x7B have revolutionized machine intelligence due to their exceptional abilities in generic ML tasks. Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines.

      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Advances in Forest Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regression forests have long delivered state-of-the-art accuracy, often outperforming regression trees and even neural networks, but they suffer from limited interpretability as ensemble methods. In this work, we revisit forest pruning, an approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression forests and the interpretability of regression trees. This pursuit, whose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart under weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability that is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models Meet Evolutionary Algorithms: Potential Enhancements and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities for generating natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper first illustrates the conceptual parallels between LLMs and EAs at a micro level, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. These parallels highlight potential opportunities for technical advancements in both LLMs and EAs. Subsequently, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research from a macro perspective to uncover critical challenges, with a particular focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. These analyses not only provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind LLMs but also offer potential directions for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Beyond RMSE and MAE: Introducing EAUC to unmask hidden bias and unfairness in dyadic regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dyadic regression models, which output real-valued predictions for pairs of entities, are fundamental in many domains (e.g. obtaining user-product ratings in Recommender Systems) and promising and under exploration in others (e.g. tuning patient-drug dosages in precision pharmacology). In this work, we prove that non-uniform observed value distributions of individual entities lead to severe biases in state-of-the-art models, skewing predictions towards the average of observed past values for the entity and providing worse-than-random predictive power in eccentric yet crucial cases; we name this phenomenon eccentricity bias. We show that global error metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are insufficient to capture this bias, and we introduce Eccentricity-Area Under the Curve (EAUC) as a novel metric that can quantify it in all studied domains and models. We prove the intuitive interpretation of EAUC by experimenting with naive post-training bias corrections, and theorize other options to use EAUC to guide the construction of fair models. This work contributes a bias-aware evaluation of dyadic regression to prevent unfairness in critical real-world applications of such systems.</description>

      <title>On the $O(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{T^{1/4}})$ Convergence Rate of RMSProp and Its Momentum Extension Measured by $\ell_1$ Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although adaptive gradient methods have been extensively used in deep learning, their convergence rates proved in the literature are all slower than that of SGD, particularly with respect to their dependence on the dimension. This paper considers the classical RMSProp and its momentum extension and establishes the convergence rate of $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^T E\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_1\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{T^{1/4}})$ measured by $\ell_1$ norm without the bounded gradient assumption, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization variable, $T$ is the iteration number, and $C$ is a constant identical to that appeared in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Our convergence rate matches the lower bound with respect to all the coefficients except the dimension $d$. Since $\|x\|_2\ll\|x\|_1\leq\sqrt{d}\|x\|_2$ for problems with extremely large $d$, our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^T E\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{T^{1/4}})$ rate of SGD in the ideal case of $\|\nabla f(x)\|_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d}\|\nabla f(x)\|_2)$.</description>

      <title>On the Completeness of Invariant Geometric Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Everyday we increasingly rely on machine learning models to automate and support high-stake tasks and decisions. This growing presence means that humans are now constantly interacting with machine learning-based systems, training and using models everyday. Several different techniques in computer science literature account for the human interaction with machine learning systems, but their classification is sparse and the goals varied. This survey proposes a taxonomy of Hybrid Decision Making Systems, providing both a conceptual and technical framework for understanding how current computer science literature models interaction between humans and machines.</description>

      <title>On the Vulnerability of LLM/VLM-Controlled Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10340v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight vulnerabilities in robotic systems integrating large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) due to input modality sensitivities. While LLM/VLM-controlled robots show impressive performance across various tasks, their reliability under slight input variations remains underexplored yet critical. These models are highly sensitive to instruction or perceptual input changes, which can trigger misalignment issues, leading to execution failures with severe real-world consequences. To study this issue, we analyze the misalignment-induced vulnerabilities within LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems and present a mathematical formulation for failure modes arising from variations in input modalities. We propose empirical perturbation strategies to expose these vulnerabilities and validate their effectiveness through experiments on multiple robot manipulation tasks. Our results show that simple input perturbations reduce task execution success rates by 22.2% and 14.6% in two representative LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems. These findings underscore the importance of input modality robustness and motivate further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of advanced LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems.</description>

      <title>MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid SNN-ANN Network for Event-based Object Detection with Spatial and Temporal AttentionEfficient Event-Based Object Detection: A Hybrid Neural Network with Spatial and Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvLSTMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</description>

      <title>DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00242v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. In this work, we present COME-robot, the first closed-loop robotic system utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios.COME-robot incorporates two key innovative modules: (i) a multi-level open-vocabulary perception and situated reasoning module that enables effective exploration of the 3D environment and target object identification using commonsense knowledge and situated information, and (ii) an iterative closed-loop feedback and restoration mechanism that verifies task feasibility, monitors execution success, and traces failure causes across different modules for robust failure recovery. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world mobile and tabletop manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~35%) compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.</description>

      <title>I/O in Machine Learning Applications on HPC Systems: A 360-degree Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge in demand for faster methods of Machine Learning (ML) model training and inference. This demand for speed has prompted the use of high performance computing (HPC) systems that excel in managing distributed workloads. Because data is the main fuel for AI applications, the performance of the storage and I/O subsystem of HPC systems is critical. In the past, HPC applications accessed large portions of data written by simulations or experiments or ingested data for visualizations or analysis tasks. ML workloads perform small reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to modern parallel storage systems. In this paper, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We define the scope of the survey, provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during offline data preparation, training, and inference, and explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature. Lastly, we seek to expose research gaps that could spawn further R&amp;D.</description>

      <title>RULSurv: A probabilistic survival-based method for early censoring-aware prediction of remaining useful life in ball bearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Censored data refers to situations where the full information about a particular event or process is only partially known. In survival analysis, censoring plays an important role, as ignoring such observations can bias the model parameters and overestimate the probability of when the event is likely to occur. There has been a renewed interest in using data-driven methods to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of ball bearings for predictive maintenance. However, few studies have explicitly addressed the challenge of handling censored data. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and flexible method for early fault detection using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis that naturally supports censored data. We demonstrate our approach in the XJTU-SY dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation across three different operating conditions. When predicting the time to failure for bearings under the highest load (C1, 12.0 kN and 2100 RPM) with 25\% random censoring, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95\% CI 13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and an MAE of 12.6 minutes (95\% CI 11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival Forests model, compared to an MAE of 18.5 minutes (95\% 17.4-19.6) using a linear LASSO model that does not support censoring. Moreover, our approach achieves a mean cumulative relative accuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings under the highest load, which improves over several state-of-the-art baselines. Our work highlights the importance of considering censored observations as part of the model design when building predictive models for early fault detection and RUL estimation.</description>

      <title>Surgical-LVLM: Learning to Adapt Large Vision-Language Model for Grounded Visual Question Answering in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Surgical Visual Question Answering (Surgical-VQA) and related region grounding have shown great promise for robotic and medical applications, addressing the critical need for automated methods in personalized surgical mentorship. However, existing models primarily provide simple structured answers and struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited capability in recognizing long-range dependencies and aligning multimodal information. In this paper, we introduce Surgical-LVLM, a novel personalized large vision-language model tailored for complex surgical scenarios. Leveraging the pre-trained large vision-language model and specialized Visual Perception LoRA (VP-LoRA) blocks, our model excels in understanding complex visual-language tasks within surgical contexts. In addressing the visual grounding task, we propose the Token-Interaction (TIT) module, which strengthens the interaction between the grounding module and the language responses of the Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) after projecting them into the latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Surgical-LVLM on several benchmarks, including EndoVis-17-VQLA, EndoVis-18-VQLA, and a newly introduced EndoVis Conversations dataset, which sets new performance standards. Our work contributes to advancing the field of automated surgical mentorship by providing a context-aware solution.</description>

      <title>HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00965v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)-a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.</description>

      <title>Distributional Associations vs In-Context Reasoning: A Study of Feed-forward and Attention Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been successful at tasks involving basic forms of in-context reasoning, such as generating coherent language, as well as storing vast amounts of knowledge. At the core of the Transformer architecture behind such models are feed-forward and attention layers, which are often associated to knowledge and reasoning, respectively. In this paper, we study this distinction empirically and theoretically in a controlled synthetic setting where certain next-token predictions involve both distributional and in-context information. We find that feed-forward layers tend to learn simple distributional associations such as bigrams, while attention layers focus on in-context reasoning. Our theoretical analysis identifies the noise in the gradients as a key factor behind this discrepancy. Finally, we illustrate how similar disparities emerge in pre-trained models through ablations on the Pythia model family on simple reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

      <title>Chip Placement with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2D chip. Because key performance metrics of the chip are determined by the placement, optimizing it is crucial. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning (RL), which is slow and struggles to generalize, requiring online training on each new circuit. Instead, we train a diffusion model capable of placing new circuits zero-shot, using guided sampling in lieu of RL to optimize placement quality. To enable such models to train at scale, we designed a capable yet efficient architecture for the denoising model, and propose a novel algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. To allow zero-shot transfer to real circuits, we empirically study the design decisions of our dataset generation algorithm, and identify several key factors enabling generalization. When trained on our synthetic data, our models generate high-quality placements on unseen, realistic circuits, achieving competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Human-AI Collaboration: A Review and Methodological Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in working environments with individuals, known as Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC), has become essential in a variety of domains, boosting decision-making, efficiency, and innovation. Despite HAIC's wide potential, evaluating its effectiveness remains challenging due to the complex interaction of components involved.
  This paper provides a detailed analysis of existing HAIC evaluation approaches and develops a fresh paradigm for more effectively evaluating these systems.
  Our framework includes a structured decision tree which assists to select relevant metrics based on distinct HAIC modes (AI-Centric, Human-Centric, and Symbiotic). By including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the framework seeks to represent HAIC's dynamic and reciprocal nature, enabling the assessment of its impact and success. This framework's practicality can be examined by its application in an array of domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and education, each of which has unique challenges and requirements. Our hope is that this study will facilitate further research on the systematic evaluation of HAIC in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Ontology Relation Extraction via Constrained Chain-of-Thought Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on task-specific ontologies for fulfilling user queries. The majority of task-oriented dialogue data, such as customer service recordings, comes without ontology and annotation. Such ontologies are normally built manually, limiting the application of specialised systems. Dialogue ontology construction is an approach for automating that process and typically consists of two steps: term extraction and relation extraction. In this work, we focus on relation extraction in a transfer learning set-up. To improve the generalisation, we propose an extension to the decoding mechanism of large language models. We adapt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding, recently developed for reasoning problems, to generative relation extraction. Here, we generate multiple branches in the decoding space and select the relations based on a confidence threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on two widely used datasets and find improvements in performance on target ontology for source fine-tuned and one-shot prompted large language models.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Incremental Explanations for Object Detectors in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detectors are widely used in safety-critical real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Explainability is especially important for safety-critical applications, and due to the variety of object detectors and their often proprietary nature, black-box explainability tools are needed. However, existing black-box explainability tools for AI models rely on multiple model calls, rendering them impractical for real-time use.
  In this paper, we introduce IncX, an algorithm and a tool for real-time black-box explainability for object detectors. The algorithm is based on linear transformations of saliency maps, producing sufficient explanations. We evaluate our implementation on four widely used video datasets of autonomous driving and demonstrate that IncX's explanations are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art and are computed two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, making them usable in real time.</description>

      <title>Massive Activations in Graph Neural Networks: Decoding Attention for Domain-Dependent Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling graph-structured data, and attention mechanisms have been pivotal in enabling these models to capture complex patterns. In our study, we reveal a critical yet underexplored consequence of integrating attention into edge-featured GNNs: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. By developing a novel method for detecting MAs on edge features, we show that these extreme activations are not only activation anomalies but encode domain-relevant signals. Our post-hoc interpretability analysis demonstrates that, in molecular graphs, MAs aggregate predominantly on common bond types (e.g., single and double bonds) while sparing more informative ones (e.g., triple bonds). Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm that MAs can serve as natural attribution indicators, reallocating to less informative edges. Our study assesses various edge-featured attention-based GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in edge-featured GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs enabling reliable post-hoc interpretability. Overall, our study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, edge-featured GNNs model, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for relating GNNs internals to domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>VernaCopter: Disambiguated Natural-Language-Driven Robot via Formal Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been an ambition of many to control a robot for a complex task using natural language (NL). The rise of large language models (LLMs) makes it closer to coming true. However, an LLM-powered system still suffers from the ambiguity inherent in an NL and the uncertainty brought up by LLMs. This paper proposes a novel LLM-based robot motion planner, named \textit{VernaCopter}, with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications serving as a bridge between NL commands and specific task objectives. The rigorous and abstract nature of formal specifications allows the planner to generate high-quality and highly consistent paths to guide the motion control of a robot. Compared to a conventional NL-prompting-based planner, the proposed VernaCopter planner is more stable and reliable due to less ambiguous uncertainty. Its efficacy and advantage have been validated by two small but challenging experimental scenarios, implying its potential in designing NL-driven robots.</description>

      <title>Zero-resource Hallucination Detection for Text Generation via Graph-based Contextual Knowledge Triples Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.</description>

      <title>Articulated Object Manipulation using Online Axis Estimation with SAM2-Based Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articulated object manipulation requires precise object interaction, where the object's axis must be carefully considered. Previous research employed interactive perception for manipulating articulated objects, but typically, open-loop approaches often suffer from overlooking the interaction dynamics. To address this limitation, we present a closed-loop pipeline integrating interactive perception with online axis estimation from segmented 3D point clouds. Our method leverages any interactive perception technique as a foundation for interactive perception, inducing slight object movement to generate point cloud frames of the evolving dynamic scene. These point clouds are then segmented using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), after which the moving part of the object is masked for accurate motion online axis estimation, guiding subsequent robotic actions. Our approach significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of manipulation tasks involving articulated objects. Experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches, especially in tasks that demand precise axis-based control.

      <title>M2Distill: Multi-Modal Distillation for Lifelong Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</description>

      <title>AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.4% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.</description>

      <title>F-Fidelity: A Robust Framework for Faithfulness Evaluation of Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has developed a number of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as gradient-based approaches, input perturbation-base methods, and black-box explanation methods. While these XAI techniques can extract meaningful insights from deep learning models, how to properly evaluate them remains an open problem. The most widely used approach is to perturb or even remove what the XAI method considers to be the most important features in an input and observe the changes in the output prediction. This approach, although straightforward, suffers the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem as the perturbed samples may no longer follow the original data distribution. A recent method RemOve And Retrain (ROAR) solves the OOD issue by retraining the model with perturbed samples guided by explanations. However, using the model retrained based on XAI methods to evaluate these explainers may cause information leakage and thus lead to unfair comparisons. We propose Fine-tuned Fidelity (F-Fidelity), a robust evaluation framework for XAI, which utilizes i) an explanation-agnostic fine-tuning strategy, thus mitigating the information leakage issue, and ii) a random masking operation that ensures that the removal step does not generate an OOD input. We also design controlled experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainers and their degraded version to verify the correctness of our framework. We conduct experiments on multiple data modalities, such as images, time series, and natural language. The results demonstrate that F-Fidelity significantly improves upon prior evaluation metrics in recovering the ground-truth ranking of the explainers. Furthermore, we show both theoretically and empirically that, given a faithful explainer, F-Fidelity metric can be used to compute the sparsity of influential input components, i.e., to extract the true explanation size.</description>

      <title>Feedback Favors the Generalization of Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known generalization problem hinders the application of artificial neural networks in continuous-time prediction tasks with varying latent dynamics. In sharp contrast, biological systems can neatly adapt to evolving environments benefiting from real-time feedback mechanisms. Inspired by the feedback philosophy, we present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement. The feedback neural network is a novel two-DOF neural network, which possesses robust performance in unseen scenarios with no loss of accuracy performance on previous tasks.} A linear feedback form is presented to correct the learned latent dynamics firstly, with a convergence guarantee. Then, domain randomization is utilized to learn a nonlinear neural feedback form. Finally, extensive tests including trajectory prediction of a real irregular object and model predictive control of a quadrotor with various uncertainties, are implemented, indicating significant improvements over state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>RecoveryChaining: Learning Local Recovery Policies for Robust Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based planners and controllers are commonly used to solve complex manipulation problems as they can efficiently optimize diverse objectives and generalize to long horizon tasks. However, they often fail during deployment due to noisy actuation, partial observability and imperfect models. To enable a robot to recover from such failures, we propose to use hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn a recovery policy. The recovery policy is triggered when a failure is detected based on sensory observations and seeks to take the robot to a state from which it can complete the task using the nominal model-based controllers. Our approach, called RecoveryChaining, uses a hybrid action space, where the model-based controllers are provided as additional \emph{nominal} options which allows the recovery policy to decide how to recover, when to switch to a nominal controller and which controller to switch to even with \emph{sparse rewards}. We evaluate our approach in three multi-step manipulation tasks with sparse rewards, where it learns significantly more robust recovery policies than those learned by baselines. We successfully transfer recovery policies learned in simulation to a physical robot to demonstrate the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer with our method.</description>

      <title>DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors. Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/NLP2CT/DetectRL.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised detection of semantic correlations in big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world data, information is stored in extremely large feature vectors. These variables are typically correlated due to complex interactions involving many features simultaneously. Such correlations qualitatively correspond to semantic roles and are naturally recognized by both the human brain and artificial neural networks. This recognition enables, for instance, the prediction of missing parts of an image or text based on their context. We present a method to detect these correlations in high-dimensional data represented as binary numbers. We estimate the binary intrinsic dimension of a dataset, which quantifies the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to describe the data, and is therefore a proxy of semantic complexity. The proposed algorithm is largely insensitive to the so-called curse of dimensionality, and can therefore be used in big data analysis. We test this approach identifying phase transitions in model magnetic systems and we then apply it to the detection of semantic correlations of images and text inside deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Empathy: How AI Chatbots Shape Conversation Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI chatbots increasingly incorporate empathy, understanding user-centered perceptions of chatbot empathy and its impact on conversation quality remains essential yet under-explored. This study examines how chatbot identity and perceived empathy influence users' overall conversation experience. Analyzing 155 conversations from two datasets, we found that while GPT-based chatbots were rated significantly higher in conversational quality, they were consistently perceived as less empathetic than human conversational partners. Empathy ratings from GPT-4o annotations aligned with user ratings, reinforcing the perception of lower empathy in chatbots compared to humans. Our findings underscore the critical role of perceived empathy in shaping conversation quality, revealing that achieving high-quality human-AI interactions requires more than simply embedding empathetic language; it necessitates addressing the nuanced ways users interpret and experience empathy in conversations with chatbots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14473v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of text-based data in domains such as healthcare, education, and social sciences has outpaced the capacity of traditional qualitative analysis methods, which are time-intensive and prone to subjectivity. Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by advanced generative AI, have emerged as transformative tools capable of automating and enhancing qualitative analysis. This study systematically maps the literature on the use of LLMs for qualitative research, exploring their application contexts, configurations, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Findings reveal that LLMs are utilized across diverse fields, demonstrating the potential to automate processes traditionally requiring extensive human input. However, challenges such as reliance on prompt engineering, occasional inaccuracies, and contextual limitations remain significant barriers. This research highlights opportunities for integrating LLMs with human expertise, improving model robustness, and refining evaluation methodologies. By synthesizing trends and identifying research gaps, this study aims to guide future innovations in the application of LLMs for qualitative analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present pseudo-batch inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 6 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Within the Classical Robotics Stack: A Case Study in Robot Soccer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.</description>

      <title>Assisted morbidity coding: the SISCO.web use case for identifying the main diagnosis in Hospital Discharge Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coding morbidity data using international standard diagnostic classifications is increasingly important and still challenging. Clinical coders and physicians assign codes to patient episodes based on their interpretation of case notes or electronic patient records. Therefore, accurate coding relies on the legibility of case notes and the coders' understanding of medical terminology. During the last ten years, many studies have shown poor reproducibility of clinical coding, even recently, with the application of Artificial Intelligence-based models. Given this context, the paper aims to present the SISCO.web approach designed to support physicians in filling in Hospital Discharge Records with proper diagnoses and procedures codes using the International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th), and, above all, in identifying the main pathological condition. The web service leverages NLP algorithms, specific coding rules, as well as ad hoc decision trees to identify the main condition, showing promising results in providing accurate ICD coding suggestions.</description>

      <title>Tell Me What to Track: Infusing Robust Language Guidance for Enhanced Referring Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to localize an arbitrary number of targets based on a language expression and continuously track them in a video. This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</description>

      <title>Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>FloNa: Floor Plan Guided Embodied Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans naturally rely on floor plans to navigate in unfamiliar environments, as they are readily available, reliable, and provide rich geometrical guidance. However, existing visual navigation settings overlook this valuable prior knowledge, leading to limited efficiency and accuracy. To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation. While the floor plan offers significant advantages, two key challenges emerge: (1) handling the spatial inconsistency between the floor plan and the actual scene layout for collision-free navigation, and (2) aligning observed images with the floor plan sketch despite their distinct modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan. We further collect $20k$ navigation episodes across $117$ scenes in the iGibson simulator to support the training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in unfamiliar scenes using floor plan knowledge. Project website: https://gauleejx.github.io/flona/.</description>

      <title>The interplay between domain specialization and model size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for language models have often focused on finding the optimal model size and token count for training from scratch. However, achieving this optimal balance requires significant compute resources due to the extensive data demands when training models from randomly-initialized weights. Continued pretraining offers a cost-effective alternative, leveraging the compute investment from pretrained models to incorporate new knowledge without requiring extensive new data. Recent findings suggest that data quality influences constants in scaling laws, thereby altering the optimal parameter-token allocation ratio. Building on this insight, we investigate the interplay between domain specialization and model size during continued pretraining under compute-constrained scenarios. Our goal is to identify an optimal training regime for this scenario and detect patterns in this interplay that can be generalized across different model sizes and domains. To compare general and specialized training, we filtered a web-based dataset to extract data from three domains: legal, medical, and accounting. We pretrained models with 1.5B, 3B, 7B, and 14B parameters on both the unfiltered and filtered datasets, then evaluated their performance on domain-specific exams. Results show that as model size increases, specialized models outperform general models while requiring less training compute. Additionally, their growing compute efficiency leads to reduced forgetting of previously learned knowledge.</description>

      <title>TempoGPT: Enhancing Time Series Reasoning via Quantizing Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal language model has made advanced progress in vision and audio, but still faces significant challenges in dealing with complex reasoning tasks in the time series domain. The reasons are twofold. First, labels for multi-modal time series data are coarse and devoid of analysis or reasoning processes. Training with these data cannot improve the model's reasoning capabilities. Second, due to the lack of precise tokenization in processing time series, the representation patterns for temporal and textual information are inconsistent, which hampers the effectiveness of multi-modal alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal time series data construction approach and a multi-modal time series language model (TLM), TempoGPT. Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks by analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system. Additionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between temporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where temporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a predefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both temporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT accurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and achieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning tasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing temporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning capabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive-scale corpora, the issue of data contamination has become increasingly severe, leading to potential overestimation of model performance during evaluation. To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that AdEval effectively reduces the impact of data contamination on evaluation outcomes, enhancing both the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process.</description>

      <title>SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15830v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Multi-Knowledge-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Ai-Chen-Lab/MKoIE.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>

      <title>RoToR: Towards More Reliable Responses for Order-Invariant Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating positional bias of language models (LMs) for listwise inputs is a well-known and important problem (e.g., lost-in-the-middle). While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to a mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner.</description>

      <title>Physics-consistent machine learning: output projection onto physical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>BigMac: A Communication-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Model Structure for Fast Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.</description>

      <title>Shh, don't say that! Domain Certification in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to perform constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining valuable information from massive data efficiently has become our research goal in the era of Big Data. Text summarization technology has been continuously developed to meet this demand. Recent work has also shown that transformer-based pre-trained language models have achieved great success on various tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Aiming at the problem of Chinese news text summary generation and the application of Transformer structure on Chinese, this paper proposes a Chinese news text summarization model (CNsum) based on Transformer structure, and tests it on Chinese datasets such as THUCNews. The results of the conducted experiments show that CNsum achieves better ROUGE score than the baseline models, which verifies the outperformance of the model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 500 languages in Nigeria, three languages -- Hausa, Yor\`ub\'a and Igbo -- spoken by over 175 million people, account for about 60% of the spoken languages. However, these languages are categorised as low-resource due to insufficient resources to support tasks in computational linguistics. Several research efforts and initiatives have been presented, however, a coherent understanding of the state of Natural Language Processing (NLP) - from grammatical formalisation to linguistic resources that support complex tasks such as language understanding and generation is lacking. This study presents the first comprehensive review of advancements in low-resource NLP (LR-NLP) research across the three major Nigerian languages (NaijaNLP). We quantitatively assess the available linguistic resources and identify key challenges. Although a growing body of literature addresses various NLP downstream tasks in Hausa, Igbo, and Yor\`ub\'a, only about 25.1% of the reviewed studies contribute new linguistic resources. This finding highlights a persistent reliance on repurposing existing data rather than generating novel, high-quality resources. Additionally, language-specific challenges, such as the accurate representation of diacritics, remain under-explored. To advance NaijaNLP and LR-NLP more broadly, we emphasise the need for intensified efforts in resource enrichment, comprehensive annotation, and the development of open collaborative initiatives.</description>

      <title>RURANET++: An Unsupervised Learning Method for Diabetic Macular Edema Based on SCSE Attention Mechanisms and Dynamic Multi-Projection Head Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), a prevalent complication among diabetic patients, constitutes a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Although deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in medical image analysis, traditional DME diagnosis still relies on extensive annotated data and subjective ophthalmologist assessments, limiting practical applications. To address this, we present RURANET++, an unsupervised learning-based automated DME diagnostic system. This framework incorporates an optimized U-Net architecture with embedded Spatial and Channel Squeeze &amp; Excitation (SCSE) attention mechanisms to enhance lesion feature extraction. During feature processing, a pre-trained GoogLeNet model extracts deep features from retinal images, followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction to 50 dimensions for computational efficiency. Notably, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm employing multi-projection heads to explicitly control cluster diversity while dynamically adjusting similarity thresholds, thereby optimizing intra-class consistency and inter-class discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across multiple metrics, achieving maximum accuracy (0.8411), precision (0.8593), recall (0.8411), and F1-score (0.8390), with exceptional clustering quality. This work provides an efficient unsupervised solution for DME diagnosis with significant clinical implications.</description>

      <title>How Diversely Can Language Models Solve Problems? Exploring the Algorithmic Diversity of Model-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating code from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities. There is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in code LMs. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate code diversity, introducing various metrics with inter-code similarity. Specifically, we introduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the number of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate the property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with human-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code diversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity. Our analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low algorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover, we explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from different models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight that code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and setting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the functional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we publicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.</description>

      <title>SFO: Piloting VLM Feedback for Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.</description>

      <title>Phi-4-Mini Technical Report: Compact yet Powerful Multimodal Language Models via Mixture-of-LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</description>

      <title>Persuade Me if You Can: A Framework for Evaluating Persuasion Effectiveness and Susceptibility Among Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Chain Operations by Routing Information Through a Global Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>M3HF: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality (M3HF), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, M3HF leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weight by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that M3HF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.</description>

      <title>LINGOLY-TOO: Disentangling Memorisation from Reasoning with Linguistic Templatisation and Orthographic Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is susceptible to overestimation due to data exposure of evaluation benchmarks. We introduce a framework for producing linguistic reasoning problems that reduces the effect of memorisation in model performance estimates and apply this framework to develop LINGOLY-TOO, a challenging benchmark for linguistic reasoning. By developing orthographic templates, we dynamically obfuscate the writing systems of real languages to generate numerousquestion variations. These variations preserve the reasoning steps required for each solution while reducing the likelihood of specific problem instances appearing in model training data. Our experiments demonstrate that frontier models, including Claud 3.7 Sonnet, o1-preview and DeepSeek R1, struggle with advanced reasoning. Our analysis also shows that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance in accuracy across permutations of the same problem, and on average perform better on questions appearing in their original orthography. Our findings highlight the opaque nature of response generation in LLMs and provide evidence that prior data exposure contributes to over estimating the reasoning capabilities of frontier models.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Augmentation in Federation: Rethinking What Collaborative Learning Can Bring Back to Decentralized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data, as an observable form of knowledge, has become one of the most important factors of production for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, increasing legislation and regulations on private and proprietary information results in scattered data sources also known as the "data islands". Although some collaborative learning paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL) can enable privacy-preserving training over decentralized data, they have inherent deficiencies in fairness, costs and reproducibility because of being learning-centric, which greatly limits the way how participants cooperate with each other. In light of this, we present a knowledge-centric paradigm termed Knowledge Augmentation in Federation (KAF), with focus on how to enhance local knowledge through collaborative effort. We provide the suggested system architecture, formulate the prototypical optimization objective, and review emerging studies that employ methodologies suitable for KAF. On our roadmap, with a three-way categorization we describe the methods for knowledge expansion, knowledge filtering, and label and feature space correction in the federation. Further, we highlight several challenges and open questions that deserve more attention from the community. With our investigation, we intend to offer new insights for what collaborative learning can bring back to decentralized data.</description>

      <title>Transformers for molecular property prediction: Domain adaptation efficiently improves performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the current transformer-based chemical language models are pre-trained on millions to billions of molecules. However, the improvement from such scaling in dataset size is not confidently linked to improved molecular property prediction. The aim of this study is to investigate and overcome some of the limitations of transformer models in predicting molecular properties. Specifically, we examine the impact of pre-training dataset size and diversity on the performance of transformer models and investigate the use of domain adaptation as a technique for improving model performance. First, our findings indicate that increasing pretraining dataset size beyond 400K molecules from the GuacaMol dataset does not result in a significant improvement on four ADME endpoints, namely, solubility, permeability, microsomal stability, and plasma protein binding. Second, our results demonstrate that using domain adaptation by further training the transformer model on a small set of domain-relevant molecules, i.e., a few hundred to a few thousand, using multi-task regression of physicochemical properties was sufficient to significantly improve performance for three out of the four investigated ADME endpoints (P-value &lt; 0.001). Finally, we observe that a model pre-trained on 400K molecules and domain adopted on a few hundred/thousand molecules performs similarly (P-value &gt; 0.05) to more complicated transformer models like MolBERT(pre-trained on 1.3M molecules) and MolFormer (pre-trained on 100M molecules). A comparison to a random forest model trained on basic physicochemical properties showed similar performance to the examined transformer models. We believe that current transformer models can be improved through further systematic analysis of pre-training and downstream data, pre-training objectives, and scaling laws, ultimately leading to better and more helpful models.</description>

      <title>Human Implicit Preference-Based Policy Fine-tuning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in USV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.</description>

      <title>Chart-HQA: A Benchmark for Hypothetical Question Answering in Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention for their strong visual-semantic understanding. Most existing chart benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' ability to parse information from charts to answer questions. However, they overlook the inherent output biases of MLLMs, where models rely on their parametric memory to answer questions rather than genuinely understanding the chart content. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Chart Hypothetical Question Answering (HQA) task, which imposes assumptions on the same question to compel models to engage in counterfactual reasoning based on the chart content. Furthermore, we introduce HAI, a human-AI interactive data synthesis approach that leverages the efficient text-editing capabilities of LLMs alongside human expert knowledge to generate diverse and high-quality HQA data at a low cost. Using HAI, we construct Chart-HQA, a challenging benchmark synthesized from publicly available data sources. Evaluation results on 18 MLLMs of varying model sizes reveal that current models face significant generalization challenges and exhibit imbalanced reasoning performance on the HQA task.</description>

      <title>Ticktack : Long Span Temporal Alignment of Large Language Models Leveraging Sexagenary Cycle Time Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</description>

      <title>Speculative MoE: Communication Efficient Parallel MoE Inference with Speculative Token and Expert Pre-scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with Cyclic User Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is motivated by federated learning (FL) where a cloud server aims to compute an averaged model (i.e., weights of deep neural networks) of the locally-trained models of numerous clients, while adhering to data security requirements. Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this concept to a three-layer network, where clustered users communicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA, beyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure that the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the local models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated with only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster users to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we consider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to $B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient aggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by gradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in distributed computing-along with a highly nontrivial security key design. We also derive novel converse bounds on the minimum achievable communication and key rates using information-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Universality of Layer-Level Entropy-Weighted Quantization Beyond Model Architecture and Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Shifting Long-Context LLMs Research from Input to Output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily concentrated on processing extended input contexts, resulting in significant strides in long-context comprehension. However, the equally critical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less attention. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research toward addressing the challenges of long-output generation. Tasks such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand extensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text. These demands highlight a critical gap in current LLM capabilities. We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and call for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating high-quality, long-form outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world applications.</description>
