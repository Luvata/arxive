      <title>Impact of Level 2/3 Automated Driving Technology on Road Work Zone Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As China's road network enters the maintenance era, work zones will become a common sight on the roads. With the development of automated driving, vehicles equipped with Level 2/3 automated driving capabilities will also become a common presence on the roads. When these vehicles pass through work zones, automated driving may disengage, which can have complex effects on traffic safety. This paper explores the impact of Level 2/3 automated driving technology on road safety in high-speed highway work zone environments. Through microscopic traffic simulation method and using full-type traffic conflict technique, factors such as market penetration rate (MPR), traffic volume level, disengagement threshold, and driver takeover style are studied to understand their impact on work zone safety. The study found that the impact of automated driving technology on work zone safety is complex. Disengagement of automated vehicles in work zones reduces the proportion of vehicles that can maintain automated driving status. If takeover is not timely or adequate, it can easily lead to new traffic conflicts. Different factors have varying degrees of impact on work zone safety. Increasing MPR helps reduce the occurrence of single-vehicle conflicts, but it also increases the possibility of multi-vehicle conflicts. Therefore, future research and improvement directions should focus on optimizing the disengagement detection and takeover mechanisms of automated driving systems.</description>

      <title>Research on Superalignment Should Advance Now with Parallel Optimization of Competence and Conformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent leap in AI capabilities, driven by big generative models, has sparked the possibility of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and further triggered discussions on Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a system surpassing all humans across all domains. This gives rise to the critical research question of: If we realize ASI, how do we align it with human values, ensuring it benefits rather than harms human society, a.k.a., the Superalignment problem. Despite ASI being regarded by many as solely a hypothetical concept, in this paper, we argue that superalignment is achievable and research on it should advance immediately, through simultaneous and alternating optimization of task competence and value conformity. We posit that superalignment is not merely a safeguard for ASI but also necessary for its realization. To support this position, we first provide a formal definition of superalignment rooted in the gap between capability and capacity and elaborate on our argument. Then we review existing paradigms, explore their interconnections and limitations, and illustrate a potential path to superalignment centered on two fundamental principles. We hope this work sheds light on a practical approach for developing the value-aligned next-generation AI, garnering greater benefits and reducing potential harms for humanity.</description>

      <title>Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Sensemaking in Novel Environments: How Human Cognition Can Inform Artificial Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most vital cognitive skills to possess is the ability to make sense of objects, events, and situations in the world. In the current paper, we offer an approach for creating artificially intelligent agents with the capacity for sensemaking in novel environments. Objectives: to present several key ideas: (1) a novel unified conceptual framework for sensemaking (which includes the existence of sign relations embedded within and across frames); (2) interaction among various content-addressable, distributed-knowledge structures via shared attributes (whose net response would represent a synthesized object, event, or situation serving as a sign for sensemaking in a novel environment). Findings: we suggest that attributes across memories can be shared and recombined in novel ways to create synthesized signs, which can denote certain outcomes in novel environments (i.e., sensemaking).</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Clause-Selection Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clause selection is arguably the most important choice point in saturation-based theorem proving. Framing it as a reinforcement learning (RL) task is a way to challenge the human-designed heuristics of state-of-the-art provers and to instead automatically evolve -- just from prover experiences -- their potentially optimal replacement. In this work, we present a neural network architecture for scoring clauses for clause selection that is powerful yet efficient to evaluate. Following RL principles to make design decisions, we integrate the network into the Vampire theorem prover and train it from successful proof attempts. An experiment on the diverse TPTP benchmark finds the neurally guided prover improve over a baseline strategy, from which it initially learns--in terms of the number of in-training-unseen problems solved under a practically relevant, short CPU instruction limit--by 20%.</description>

      <title>RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</description>

      <title>Safe Explicable Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When users work with AI agents, they form conscious or subconscious expectations of them. Meeting user expectations is crucial for such agents to engage in successful interactions and teaming. However, users may form expectations of an agent that differ from the agent's planned behaviors. These differences lead to the consideration of two separate decision models in the planning process to generate explicable behaviors. However, little has been done to incorporate safety considerations, especially in a learning setting. We present Safe Explicable Policy Search (SEPS), which aims to provide a learning approach to explicable behavior generation while minimizing the safety risk, both during and after learning. We formulate SEPS as a constrained optimization problem where the agent aims to maximize an explicability score subject to constraints on safety and a suboptimality criterion based on the agent's model. SEPS innovatively combines the capabilities of Constrained Policy Optimization and Explicable Policy Search. We evaluate SEPS in safety-gym environments and with a physical robot experiment to show that it can learn explicable behaviors that adhere to the agent's safety requirements and are efficient. Results show that SEPS can generate safe and explicable behaviors while ensuring a desired level of performance w.r.t. the agent's objective, and has real-world relevance in human-AI teaming.</description>

      <title>Actual Causation and Nondeterministic Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (Beckers, 2025) I introduced nondeterministic causal models as a generalization of Pearl's standard deterministic causal models. I here take advantage of the increased expressivity offered by these models to offer a novel definition of actual causation (that also applies to deterministic models). Instead of motivating the definition by way of (often subjective) intuitions about examples, I proceed by developing it based entirely on the unique function that it can fulfil in communicating and learning a causal model. First I generalize the more basic notion of counterfactual dependence, second I show how this notion has a vital role to play in the logic of causal discovery, third I introduce the notion of a structural simplification of a causal model, and lastly I bring both notions together in my definition of actual causation. Although novel, the resulting definition arrives at verdicts that are almost identical to those of my previous definition (Beckers, 2021, 2022).</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off: A Case Study of Inferring Ratings from Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning models offer understandable reasoning behind their decision-making process, though they may not always match the performance of their black-box counterparts. This trade-off between interpretability and model performance has sparked discussions around the deployment of AI, particularly in critical applications where knowing the rationale of decision-making is essential for trust and accountability. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of several black-box and interpretable models, focusing on a specific NLP use case that has received limited attention: inferring ratings from reviews. Through this use case, we explore the intricate relationship between the performance and interpretability of different models. We introduce a quantitative score called Composite Interpretability (CI) to help visualize the trade-off between interpretability and performance, particularly in the case of composite models. Our results indicate that, in general, the learning performance improves as interpretability decreases, but this relationship is not strictly monotonic, and there are instances where interpretable models are more advantageous.</description>

      <title>BEARCUBS: A benchmark for computer-using web agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing search inefficiencies and domain knowledge gaps as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 24.3% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</description>

      <title>The StudyChat Dataset: Student Dialogues With ChatGPT in an Artificial Intelligence Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has significantly impacted education, raising both opportunities and challenges. Students can frequently interact with LLM-powered, interactive learning tools, but their usage patterns need to be analyzed to ensure ethical usage of these tools. To better understand how students interact with LLMs in an academic setting, we introduce \textbf{StudyChat}, a publicly available dataset capturing real-world student interactions with an LLM-powered tutoring chatbot in a semester-long, university-level artificial intelligence (AI) course. We deploy a web application that replicates ChatGPT's core functionalities, and use it to log student interactions with the LLM while working on programming assignments. We collect 1,197 conversations, which we annotate using a dialogue act labeling schema inspired by observed interaction patterns and prior research. Additionally, we analyze these interactions, highlight behavioral trends, and analyze how specific usage patterns relate to course outcomes. \textbf{StudyChat} provides a rich resource for the learning sciences and AI in education communities, enabling further research into the evolving role of LLMs in education.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Corroborating and Refuting Evidence Retrieval for Scientific Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CIBER (Claim Investigation Based on Evidence Retrieval), an extension of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to identify corroborating and refuting documents as evidence for scientific claim verification. CIBER addresses the inherent uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating response consistency across diverse interrogation probes. By focusing on the behavioral analysis of LLMs without requiring access to their internal information, CIBER is applicable to both white-box and black-box models. Furthermore, CIBER operates in an unsupervised manner, enabling easy generalization across various scientific domains. Comprehensive evaluations conducted using LLMs with varying levels of linguistic proficiency reveal CIBER's superior performance compared to conventional RAG approaches. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of CIBER but also provide valuable insights for future advancements in LLM-based scientific claim verification.</description>

      <title>Boundary Prompting: Elastic Urban Region Representation via Graph-based Spatial Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban region representation is essential for various applications such as urban planning, resource allocation, and policy development. Traditional methods rely on fixed, predefined region boundaries, which fail to capture the dynamic and complex nature of real-world urban areas. In this paper, we propose the Boundary Prompting Urban Region Representation Framework (BPURF), a novel approach that allows for elastic urban region definitions. BPURF comprises two key components: (1) A spatial token dictionary, where urban entities are treated as tokens and integrated into a unified token graph, and (2) a region token set representation model which utilize token aggregation and a multi-channel model to embed token sets corresponding to region boundaries. Additionally, we propose fast token set extraction strategy to enable online token set extraction during training and prompting. This framework enables the definition of urban regions through boundary prompting, supporting varying region boundaries and adapting to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BPURF in capturing the complex characteristics of urban regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disconnected data silos within enterprises obstruct the extraction of actionable insights, diminishing efficiency in areas such as product development, client engagement, meeting preparation, and analytics-driven decision-making. This paper introduces a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to unify various data sources into a comprehensive, activity-centric knowledge graph. The framework automates tasks such as entity extraction, relationship inference, and semantic enrichment, enabling advanced querying, reasoning, and analytics across data types like emails, calendars, chats, documents, and logs. Designed for enterprise flexibility, it supports applications such as contextual search, task prioritization, expertise discovery, personalized recommendations, and advanced analytics to identify trends and actionable insights. Experimental results demonstrate its success in the discovery of expertise, task management, and data-driven decision making. By integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs, this solution bridges disconnected systems and delivers intelligent analytics-powered enterprise tools.</description>

      <title>SQLCritic: Correcting Text-to-SQL Generation via Clause-wise Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL systems have improved the conversion of natural language queries into SQL, but challenges remain in ensuring accuracy and reliability. While self-correction techniques refine outputs, they often introduce new errors. Existing methods focused on execution feedback mainly address syntax issues, leaving semantic errors -- where the query's logic fails to align with the user's intent -- largely unaddressed.
  We propose a novel approach combining structured execution feedback with a trained critic agent that provides detailed, interpretable critiques. This method effectively identifies and corrects both syntactic and semantic errors, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show significant improvements on two major Text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider and BIRD, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Language Reasoning for Explainable Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable recommendation systems leverage transparent reasoning to foster user trust and improve decision-making processes. Current approaches typically decouple recommendation generation from explanation creation, violating causal precedence principles where explanatory factors should logically precede outcomes. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating structural causal models with large language models to establish causal consistency in recommendation pipelines. Our methodology enforces explanation factors as causal antecedents to recommendation predictions through causal graph construction and counterfactual adjustment. We particularly address the confounding effect of item popularity that distorts personalization signals in explanations, developing a debiasing mechanism that disentangles genuine user preferences from conformity bias. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that CausalX achieves superior performance in recommendation accuracy, explanation plausibility, and bias mitigation compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>STGDPM:Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical component for ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>AI-native Memory 2.0: Second Me</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Enhancing Paradigms within Federated Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have proven highly effective in solving complex problems by integrating multiple agents, each performing different roles. However, in sensitive domains, they face emerging privacy protection challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Federated MAS, highlighting the fundamental differences between Federated MAS and traditional FL. We then identify key challenges in developing Federated MAS, including: 1) heterogeneous privacy protocols among agents, 2) structural differences in multi-party conversations, and 3) dynamic conversational network structures. To address these challenges, we propose Embedded Privacy-Enhancing Agents (EPEAgent), an innovative solution that integrates seamlessly into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) phase and the context retrieval stage. This solution minimizes data flows, ensuring that only task-relevant, agent-specific information is shared. Additionally, we design and generate a comprehensive dataset to evaluate the proposed paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EPEAgent effectively enhances privacy protection while maintaining strong system performance. The code will be availiable at https://github.com/ZitongShi/EPEAgent</description>

      <title>Guess What I am Thinking: A Benchmark for Inner Thought Reasoning of Role-Playing Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have attracted broad attention in various applications. While chain-of-thought reasoning has shown importance in many tasks for LLMs, the internal thinking processes of RPLAs remain unexplored. Understanding characters' inner thoughts is crucial for developing advanced RPLAs. In this paper, we introduce ROLETHINK, a novel benchmark constructed from literature for evaluating character thought generation. We propose the task of inner thought reasoning, which includes two sets: the gold set that compares generated thoughts with original character monologues, and the silver set that uses expert synthesized character analyses as references. To address this challenge, we propose MIRROR, a chain-of-thought approach that generates character thoughts by retrieving memories, predicting character reactions, and synthesizing motivations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the importance of inner thought reasoning for RPLAs, and MIRROR consistently outperforms existing methods.

      <title>HASARD: A Benchmark for Vision-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning in Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{HASARD}, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to $\textbf{HA}$rness $\textbf{SA}$fe $\textbf{R}$L with $\textbf{D}$oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods. The environments and baseline implementations are open-sourced at https://sites.google.com/view/hasard-bench/.</description>

      <title>Beyond Outlining: Heterogeneous Recursive Planning for Adaptive Long-form Writing with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types, i.e. retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence: Supercharging Multimodal LLMs with an Uncertainty-Aware Agentic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in tasks like visual question answering (VQA) but still face challenges in multimodal reasoning. Recent works adapt agentic frameworks or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. However, CoT-based multimodal reasoning often demands costly data annotation and fine-tuning, while agentic approaches relying on external tools risk introducing unreliable output from these tools. In this paper, we propose Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence (SRICE), a training-free multimodal reasoning framework that integrates external vision models with uncertainty quantification (UQ) into an MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, SRICE guides the inference process by allowing MLLM to autonomously select regions of interest through multi-stage interactions with the help of external tools. We propose to use a conformal prediction-based approach to calibrate the output of external tools and select the optimal tool by estimating the uncertainty of an MLLM's output. Our experiment shows that the average improvement of SRICE over the base MLLM is 4.6% on five datasets and the performance on some datasets even outperforms fine-tuning-based methods, revealing the significance of ensuring reliable tool use in an MLLM agent.</description>

      <title>Chemical reasoning in LLMs unlocks steerable synthesis planning and reaction mechanism elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Graph of AI Ideas: Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and LLMs for AI Research Idea Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reading relevant scientific papers and analyzing research development trends is a critical step in generating new scientific ideas. However, the rapid increase in the volume of research literature and the complex citation relationships make it difficult for researchers to quickly analyze and derive meaningful research trends. The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided a novel approach for automatically summarizing papers and generating innovative research ideas. However, existing paper-based idea generation methods either simply input papers into LLMs via prompts or form logical chains of creative development based on citation relationships, without fully exploiting the semantic information embedded in these citations. Inspired by knowledge graphs and human cognitive processes, we propose a framework called the Graph of AI Ideas (GoAI) for the AI research field, which is dominated by open-access papers. This framework organizes relevant literature into entities within a knowledge graph and summarizes the semantic information contained in citations into relations within the graph. This organization effectively reflects the relationships between two academic papers and the advancement of the AI research field. Such organization aids LLMs in capturing the current progress of research, thereby enhancing their creativity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating novel, clear, and effective research ideas.</description>

      <title>Reasoning and Sampling-Augmented MCQ Difficulty Prediction via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) is a crucial factor for educational assessments. Predicting MCQ difficulty is challenging since it requires understanding both the complexity of reaching the correct option and the plausibility of distractors, i.e., incorrect options. In this paper, we propose a novel, two-stage method to predict the difficulty of MCQs. First, to better estimate the complexity of each MCQ, we use large language models (LLMs) to augment the reasoning steps required to reach each option. We use not just the MCQ itself but also these reasoning steps as input to predict the difficulty. Second, to capture the plausibility of distractors, we sample knowledge levels from a distribution to account for variation among students responding to the MCQ. This setup, inspired by item response theory (IRT), enable us to estimate the likelihood of students selecting each (both correct and incorrect) option. We align these predictions with their ground truth values, using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization objective, and use estimated likelihoods to predict MCQ difficulty. We evaluate our method on two real-world \emph{math} MCQ and response datasets with ground truth difficulty values estimated using IRT. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all baselines, up to a 28.3\% reduction in mean squared error and a 34.6\% improvement in the coefficient of determination. We also qualitatively discuss how our novel method results in higher accuracy in predicting MCQ difficulty.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal concerning rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (30.6%), DeepSeek R1 (15.8%) and ChatGPT-4o (12.6%) all answer a high proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</description>

      <title>Principal deuterium Hugoniot via Quantum Monte Carlo and $\Delta$-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03570v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the principal deuterium Hugoniot for pressures up to $150$ GPa, using Machine Learning potentials (MLPs) trained with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energies, forces and pressures. In particular, we adopted a recently proposed workflow based on the combination of Gaussian kernel regression and $\Delta$-learning. By fully taking advantage of this method, we explicitly considered finite-temperature electrons in the dynamics, whose effects are highly relevant for temperatures above $10$ kK. The Hugoniot curve obtained by our MLPs shows a good agreement with the most recent experiments, particularly in the region below 60 GPa. At larger pressures, our Hugoniot curve is slightly more compressible than the one yielded by experiments, whose uncertainties generally increase, however, with pressure. Our work demonstrates that QMC can be successfully combined with $\Delta$-learning to deploy reliable MLPs for complex extended systems across different thermodynamic conditions, by keeping the QMC precision at the computational cost of a mean-field calculation.</description>

      <title>Addressing Selection Bias in Computerized Adaptive Testing: A User-Wise Aggregate Influence Function Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a widely used, efficient test mode that adapts to the examinee's proficiency level in the test domain. CAT requires pre-trained item profiles, for CAT iteratively assesses the student real-time based on the registered items' profiles, and selects the next item to administer using candidate items' profiles. However, obtaining such item profiles is a costly process that involves gathering a large, dense item-response data, then training a diagnostic model on the collected data. In this paper, we explore the possibility of leveraging response data collected in the CAT service. We first show that this poses a unique challenge due to the inherent selection bias introduced by CAT, i.e., more proficient students will receive harder questions. Indeed, when naively training the diagnostic model using CAT response data, we observe that item profiles deviate significantly from the ground-truth. To tackle the selection bias issue, we propose the user-wise aggregate influence function method. Our intuition is to filter out users whose response data is heavily biased in an aggregate manner, as judged by how much perturbation the added data will introduce during parameter estimation. This way, we may enhance the performance of CAT while introducing minimal bias to the item profiles. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method based on the three public datasets and one dataset that contains real-world CAT response data.</description>

      <title>BIPED: Pedagogically Informed Tutoring System for ESL Education</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.</description>

      <title>Junior Software Developers' Perspectives on Adopting LLMs for Software Engineering: a Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many studies exploring the adoption of Large Language Model-based tools for software development by junior developers have emerged in recent years. These studies have sought to understand developers' perspectives about using those tools, a fundamental pillar for successfully adopting LLM-based tools in Software Engineering. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of junior software developers' perspectives and use of LLM-based tools for software engineering (LLM4SE). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) following guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 56 primary studies, applying the definition for junior software developers as software developers with equal or less than five years of experience, including Computer Science/Software Engineering students. We found that the majority of the studies focused on comprehending the different aspects of integrating AI tools in SE. Only 8.9\% of the studies provide a clear definition for junior software developers, and there is no uniformity. Searching for relevant information is the most common task using LLM tools. ChatGPT was the most common LLM tool present in the studies (and experiments). A majority of the studies (83.9\%) report both positive and negative perceptions about the impact of adopting LLM tools. We also found and categorised advantages, challenges, and recommendations regarding LLM adoption. Our results indicate that developers are using LLMs not just for code generation, but also to improve their development skills. Critically, they are not just experiencing the benefits of adopting LLM tools, but they are also aware of at least a few LLM limitations, such as the generation of wrong suggestions, potential data leaking, and AI hallucination. Our findings offer implications for software engineering researchers, educators, and developers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of science and the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, Large Language Models (LLMs) have begun to be widely utilized across various fields. However, in the field of psychological counseling, the ability of LLMs have not been systematically assessed. In this study, we assessed the psychological counseling ability of mainstream LLMs using 1096 psychological counseling skill questions which were selected from the Chinese National Counselor Level 3 Examination, including Knowledge-based, Analytical-based, and Application-based question types. The analysis showed that the correctness rates of the LLMs for Chinese questions, in descending order, were GLM-3 (46.5%), GPT-4 (46.1%), Gemini (45.0%), ERNIE-3.5 (45.7%) and GPT-3.5 (32.9%). The correctness rates of the LLMs for English questions, in descending order, were ERNIE-3.5 (43.9%), GPT-4 (40.6%), Gemini (36.6%), GLM-3 (29.9%) and GPT-3.5 (29.5%). A chi-square test indicated significant differences in the LLMs' performance on Chinese and English questions. Furthermore, we subsequently utilized the Counselor's Guidebook (Level 3) as a reference for ERNIE-3.5, resulting in a new correctness rate of 59.6%, a 13.8% improvement over its initial rate of 45.8%. In conclusion, the study assessed the psychological counseling ability of LLMs for the first time, which may provide insights for future enhancement and improvement of psychological counseling ability of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the data era, the integration of multiple data types, known as multimodality, has become a key area of interest in the research community. This interest is driven by the goal to develop cutting edge multimodal models capable of serving as adaptable reasoning engines across a wide range of modalities and domains. Despite the fervent development efforts, the challenge of optimally representing different forms of data within a single unified latent space a crucial step for enabling effective multimodal reasoning has not been fully addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce AlignXpert, an optimization algorithm inspired by Kernel CCA crafted to maximize the similarities between N modalities while imposing some other constraints. This work demonstrates the impact on improving data representation for a variety of reasoning tasks, such as retrieval and classification, underlining the pivotal importance of data representation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Taxonomy Similarity for Next Activity Prediction in Patient Treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in modern medicine presents physicians with complex challenges when planning patient treatment. Techniques from the field of Predictive Business Process Monitoring, like Next-activity-prediction (NAP) can be used as a promising technique to support physicians in treatment planning, by proposing a possible next treatment step. Existing patient data, often in the form of electronic health records, can be analyzed to recommend the next suitable step in the treatment process. However, the use of patient data poses many challenges due to its knowledge-intensive character, high variability and scarcity of medical data. To overcome these challenges, this article examines the use of the knowledge encoded in taxonomies to improve and explain the prediction of the next activity in the treatment process. This study proposes the TS4NAP approach, which uses medical taxonomies (ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS) in combination with graph matching to assess the similarities of medical codes to predict the next treatment step. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated using event logs that are derived from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results highlight the potential of using domain-specific knowledge held in taxonomies to improve the prediction of the next activity, and thus can improve treatment planning and decision-making by making the predictions more explainable.</description>

      <title>BrainNet-MoE: Brain-Inspired Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Neurological Disease Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early differentiation between AD and LBD is crucial because they require different treatment approaches, but this is challenging due to significant clinical overlap, heterogeneity, complex pathogenesis, and the rarity of LBD. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate powerful learning capabilities and offer new hope for accurate diagnosis, existing methods primarily focus on designing "neural-level networks". Our work represents a pioneering effort in modeling system-level artificial neural network called BrainNet-MoE for brain modeling and diagnosing. Inspired by the brain's hierarchical organization of bottom-up sensory integration and top-down control, we design a set of disease-specific expert groups to process brain sub-network under different condition, A disease gate mechanism guides the specializa-tion of expert groups, while a transformer layer enables communication be-tween all sub-networks, generating a comprehensive whole-brain represen-tation for downstream disease classification. Experimental results show superior classification accuracy with interpretable insights into how brain sub-networks contribute to different neurodegenerative conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep ARTMAP: Generalized Hierarchical Learning with Adaptive Resonance Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Deep ARTMAP, a novel extension of the ARTMAP architecture that generalizes the self-consistent modular ART (SMART) architecture to enable hierarchical learning (supervised and unsupervised) across arbitrary transformations of data. The Deep ARTMAP framework operates as a divisive clustering mechanism, supporting an arbitrary number of modules with customizable granularity within each module. Inter-ART modules regulate the clustering at each layer, permitting unsupervised learning while enforcing a one-to-many mapping from clusters in one layer to the next. While Deep ARTMAP reduces to both ARTMAP and SMART in particular configurations, it offers significantly enhanced flexibility, accommodating a broader range of data transformations and learning modalities.</description>

      <title>ConstellationNet: Reinventing Spatial Clustering through GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial clustering is a crucial field, finding universal use across criminology, pathology, and urban planning. However, most spatial clustering algorithms cannot pull information from nearby nodes and suffer performance drops when dealing with higher dimensionality and large datasets, making them suboptimal for large-scale and high-dimensional clustering. Due to modern data growing in size and dimension, clustering algorithms become weaker when addressing multifaceted issues. To improve upon this, we develop ConstellationNet, a convolution neural network(CNN)-graph neural network(GNN) framework that leverages the embedding power of a CNN, the neighbor aggregation of a GNN, and a neural network's ability to deal with batched data to improve spatial clustering and classification with graph augmented predictions. ConstellationNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering across several datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art classification and clustering while reducing model size and training time by up to tenfold and improving baselines by 10 times. Because of its fast training and powerful nature, ConstellationNet holds promise in fields like epidemiology and medical imaging, able to quickly train on new data to develop robust responses.</description>

      <title>TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</description>

      <title>Insights into Schizophrenia: Leveraging Machine Learning for Early Identification via EEG, ERP, and Demographic Attributes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research presents a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to differentiate between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by utilising features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, specifically focusing on event-related potentials (ERPs) and certain demographic variables. The dataset comprises data from 81 participants, encompassing 32 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia patients, all sourced from an online dataset. After preprocessing the dataset, our ML model achieved an accuracy of 99.980%. This performance outperforms earlier research, including those that used deep learning methods. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to assess individual features' contribution to improving classification accuracy. This involved systematically excluding specific features from the original dataset one at a time, and another technique involved an iterative process of removing features based on their entropy scores incrementally. The impact of these removals on model performance was evaluated to identify the most informative features.</description>

      <title>GraphT5: Unified Molecular Graph-Language Modeling via Multi-Modal Cross-Token Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular language modeling tasks such as molecule captioning have been recognized for their potential to further understand molecular properties that can aid drug discovery or material synthesis based on chemical reactions. Unlike the common use of molecule graphs in predicting molecular properties, most methods in molecular language modeling rely heavily on SMILES sequences. This preference is because the task involves generating a sequence of multiple tokens using transformer-based models. Therefore, a main challenge is determining how to integrate graph data, which contains structural and spatial information about molecules, with text data. In addition, simply using both 1D SMILES text and 2D graph as inputs without addressing how they align and represent the molecule structure in different modalities makes it challenging to fully utilize structural knowledge about molecules. To this end, we propose GraphT5, a multi-modal framework that integrates 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations of molecules for molecular language modeling. Specifically, we introduce a novel cross-token attention module in GraphT5 to bridge the gap arising from the fundamental differences between the two modalities of molecule representations. Cross-token attention exploits implicit information between SMILES and graphs of molecules, resulting from their interactions at a fine-grained token level that benefits molecular language modeling. Extensive experiments including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction tasks, and case studies show that our GraphT5 outperforms the latest baseline approaches, which validates the effectiveness of our GraphT5 in sufficiently utilizing 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations.</description>

      <title>SplitQuantV2: Enhancing Low-Bit Quantization of LLMs Without GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantization of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deploying them on devices with limited computational resources. While advanced quantization algorithms offer improved performance compared to the basic linear quantization, they typically require high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), are often restricted to specific deep neural network (DNN) frameworks, and require calibration datasets. This limitation poses challenges for using such algorithms on various neural processing units (NPUs) and edge AI devices, which have diverse model formats and frameworks. In this paper, we show SplitQuantV2, an innovative algorithm designed to enhance low-bit linear quantization of LLMs, can achieve results comparable to those of advanced algorithms. SplitQuantV2 preprocesses models by splitting linear and convolution layers into functionally equivalent, quantization-friendly structures. The algorithm's platform-agnostic, concise, and efficient nature allows for implementation without the need for GPUs. Our evaluation on the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model using the AI2's Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset demonstrates that SplitQuantV2 improves the accuracy of the INT4 quantization model by 11.76%p, matching the performance of the original floating-point model. Remarkably, SplitQuantV2 took only 2 minutes 6 seconds to preprocess the 1B model and perform linear INT4 quantization using only an Apple M4 CPU. SplitQuantV2 provides a practical solution for low-bit quantization on LLMs, especially when complex, computation-intensive algorithms are inaccessible due to hardware limitations or framework incompatibilities.</description>

      <title>Disrupting Model Merging: A Parameter-Level Defense Without Sacrificing Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</description>

      <title>Merge then Realign: Simple and Effective Modality-Incremental Continual Learning for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enhanced their versatility as they integrate a growing number of modalities. Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is necessary to reuse the existing ones and further extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). However, this often comes with a performance degradation in the previously learned modalities. In this work, we revisit the MCL and investigate a more severe issue it faces in contrast to traditional continual learning, that its degradation comes not only from catastrophic forgetting but also from the misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To address this problem, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA). Our method avoids introducing heavy training overhead or modifying the model architecture, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, despite the simplicity of MERA, it shows impressive performance, holding up to a 99.84% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving a nearly lossless MCL performance.</description>

      <title>Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>The potential role of AI agents in transforming nuclear medicine research and cancer management in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: India faces a significant cancer burden, with an incidence-to-mortality ratio indicating that nearly three out of five individuals diagnosed with cancer succumb to the disease. While the limitations of physical healthcare infrastructure are widely acknowledged as a primary challenge, concerted efforts by government and healthcare agencies are underway to mitigate these constraints. However, given the country's vast geography and high population density, it is imperative to explore alternative soft infrastructure solutions to complement existing frameworks. Artificial Intelligence agents are increasingly transforming problem-solving approaches across various domains, with their application in medicine proving particularly transformative. In this perspective, we examine the potential role of AI agents in advancing nuclear medicine for cancer research, diagnosis, and management in India. We begin with a brief overview of AI agents and their capabilities, followed by a proposed agent-based ecosystem that can address prevailing sustainability challenges in India nuclear medicine.</description>

      <title>TVNet: A Novel Time Series Analysis Method Based on Dynamic Convolution and 3D-Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent development and advancement of Transformer and MLP architectures, significant strides have been made in time series analysis. Conversely, the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis has fallen short of expectations, diminishing their potential for future applications. Our research aims to enhance the representational capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis by introducing novel perspectives and design innovations. To be specific, We introduce a novel time series reshaping technique that considers the inter-patch, intra-patch, and cross-variable dimensions. Consequently, we propose TVNet, a dynamic convolutional network leveraging a 3D perspective to employ time series analysis. TVNet retains the computational efficiency of CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results in five key time series analysis tasks, offering a superior balance of efficiency and performance over the state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Additionally, our findings suggest that TVNet exhibits enhanced transferability and robustness. Therefore, it provides a new perspective for applying CNN in advanced time series analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>DynTaskMAS: A Dynamic Task Graph-driven Framework for Asynchronous and Parallel LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence, yet current implementations face significant challenges in resource management, task coordination, and system efficiency. While existing frameworks demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in collaborative problem-solving, they often lack sophisticated mechanisms for parallel execution and dynamic task management. This paper introduces DynTaskMAS, a novel framework that orchestrates asynchronous and parallel operations in LLM-based MAS through dynamic task graphs. The framework features four key innovations: (1) a Dynamic Task Graph Generator that intelligently decomposes complex tasks while maintaining logical dependencies, (2) an Asynchronous Parallel Execution Engine that optimizes resource utilization through efficient task scheduling, (3) a Semantic-Aware Context Management System that enables efficient information sharing among agents, and (4) an Adaptive Workflow Manager that dynamically optimizes system performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DynTaskMAS achieves significant improvements over traditional approaches: a 21-33% reduction in execution time across task complexities (with higher gains for more complex tasks), a 35.4% improvement in resource utilization (from 65% to 88%), and near-linear throughput scaling up to 16 concurrent agents (3.47X improvement for 4X agents). Our framework establishes a foundation for building scalable, high-performance LLM-based multi-agent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>The Janus Face of Innovation: Global Disparities and Divergent Options</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article examines how unequal access to AI innovation creates systemic challenges for developing countries. Differential access to AI innovation results from the acute competition between domestic and global actors. While developing nations contribute significantly to AI development through data annotation labor, they face limited access to advanced AI technologies and are increasingly caught between divergent regulatory approaches from democratic and authoritarian tendencies. This brief paper analyzes how more affordable AI engagement and Western countries' development cooperation present developing nations with a complex choice between accessibility and governance standards. I argue this challenge entails new institutional mechanisms for technology transfer and regulatory cooperation, while carefully balancing universal standards with local needs. In turn, good practices could help developing countries close the deepening gap of global technological divides, while ensuring responsible AI development in developing countries.</description>

      <title>PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference Time by Leveraging Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.</description>

      <title>Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Balance Packing: Towards Efficient Supervised Fine-tuning for Long-Context LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MOE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance.</description>

      <title>A Time Series Multitask Framework Integrating a Large Language Model, Pre-Trained Time Series Model, and Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and industry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</description>

      <title>Ways of Seeing, and Selling, AI Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In early 2025, Augmented Intelligence - Christie's first AI art auction - drew criticism for showcasing a controversial genre. Amid wider legal uncertainty, artists voiced concerns over data mining practices, notably with respect to copyright. The backlash could be viewed as a microcosm of AI's contested position in the creative economy. Touching on the auction's presentation, reception, and results, this paper explores how, among social dissonance, machine learning finds its place in the artworld. Foregrounding responsible innovation, the paper provides a balanced perspective that champions creators' rights and brings nuance to this polarised debate. With a focus on exhibition design, it centres framing, which refers to the way a piece is presented to influence consumer perception. Context plays a central role in shaping our understanding of how good, valuable, and even ethical an artwork is. In this regard, Augmented Intelligence situates AI art within a surprisingly traditional framework, leveraging hallmarks of "high art" to establish the genre's cultural credibility. Generative AI has a clear economic dimension, converging questions of artistic merit with those of monetary worth. Scholarship on ways of seeing, or framing, could substantively inform the interpretation and evaluation of creative outputs, including assessments of their aesthetic and commercial value.</description>

      <title>Adaptive routing protocols for determining optimal paths in AI multi-agent systems: a priority- and learning-enhanced approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As distributed artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-agent architectures grow increasingly complex, the need for adaptive, context-aware routing becomes paramount. This paper introduces an enhanced, adaptive routing algorithm tailored for AI multi-agent networks, integrating priority-based cost functions and dynamic learning mechanisms. Building on an extended Dijkstra-based framework, we incorporate multi-faceted parameters such as task complexity, user request priority, agent capabilities, bandwidth, latency, load, model sophistication, and reliability. We further propose dynamically adaptive weighting factors, tuned via reinforcement learning (RL), to continuously evolve routing policies based on observed network performance. Additionally, heuristic filtering and hierarchical routing structures improve scalability and responsiveness. Our approach yields context-sensitive, load-aware, and priority-focused routing decisions that not only reduce latency for critical tasks but also optimize overall resource utilization, ultimately enhancing the robustness, flexibility, and efficiency of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Deliberation: The AI Penalty and the Emergence of a New Deliberative Divide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital deliberation has expanded democratic participation, yet challenges remain. This includes processing information at scale, moderating discussions, fact-checking, or attracting people to participate. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer potential solutions, but public perceptions of AI's role in deliberation remain underexplored. Beyond efficiency, democratic deliberation is about voice and recognition. If AI is integrated into deliberation, public trust, acceptance, and willingness to participate may be affected. We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with a representative sample in Germany (n=1850) to examine how information about AI-enabled deliberation influences willingness to participate and perceptions of deliberative quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to treatments that provided them information about deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans. Our findings reveal a significant AI-penalty. Participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and rated its quality lower than human-led formats. These effects were moderated by individual predispositions. Perceptions of AI's societal benefits and anthropomorphization of AI showed positive interaction effects on people's interest to participate in AI-enabled deliberative formats and positive quality assessments, while AI risk assessments showed negative interactions with information about AI-enabled deliberation. These results suggest AI-enabled deliberation faces substantial public skepticism, potentially even introducing a new deliberative divide. Unlike traditional participation gaps based on education or demographics, this divide is shaped by attitudes toward AI. As democratic engagement increasingly moves online, ensuring AI's role in deliberation does not discourage participation or deepen inequalities will be a key challenge for future research and policy.</description>

      <title>A Task and Motion Planning Framework Using Iteratively Deepened AND/OR Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for integrated task and motion planning based on an AND/OR graph network, which is used to represent task-level states and actions, and we leverage it to implement different classes of task and motion planning problems (TAMP). Several problems that fall under task and motion planning do not have a predetermined number of sub-tasks to achieve a goal. For example, while retrieving a target object from a cluttered workspace, in principle the number of object re-arrangements required to finally grasp it cannot be known ahead of time. To address this challenge, and in contrast to traditional planners, also those based on AND/OR graphs, we grow the AND/OR graph at run-time by progressively adding sub-graphs until grasping the target object becomes feasible, which yields a network of AND/OR graphs. The approach is extended to enable multi-robot task and motion planning, and (i) it allows us to perform task allocation while coordinating the activity of a given number of robots, and (ii) can handle multi-robot tasks involving an a priori unknown number of sub-tasks. The approach is evaluated and validated both in simulation and with a real dual-arm robot manipulator, that is, Baxter from Rethink Robotics. In particular, for the single-robot task and motion planning, we validated our approach in three different TAMP domains. Furthermore, we also use three different robots for simulation, namely, Baxter, Franka Emika Panda manipulators, and a PR2 robot. Experiments show that our approach can be readily scaled to scenarios with many objects and robots, and is capable of handling different classes of TAMP problems.</description>

      <title>Automated Benchmark Generation for Repository-Level Coding Tasks</title>

Abstract: Code Agent development is an extremely active research area, where a reliable performance metric is critical for tracking progress and guiding new developments. This demand is underscored by the meteoric rise in popularity of SWE-Bench. This benchmark challenges code agents to generate patches addressing GitHub issues given the full repository as context. The correctness of generated patches is then evaluated by executing a human-written test suite extracted from the repository after the issue's resolution. However, constructing benchmarks like SWE-Bench requires substantial manual effort to set up historically accurate execution environments for testing. Crucially, this severely limits the number of considered repositories, e.g., just 12 for SWE-Bench. Considering so few repositories, selected for their popularity runs the risk of leading to a distributional mismatch, i.e., the measured performance may not be representative of real-world scenarios potentially misguiding development efforts. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce SetUpAgent, a fully automated system capable of historically accurate dependency setup, test execution, and result parsing. Using SetUpAgent, we generate two new datasets: (i) SWEE-Bench an extended version of SWE-Bench encompassing hundreds of repositories, and (ii) SWA-Bench a benchmark focusing on applications rather than libraries. Comparing these datasets to SWE-Bench with respect to their characteristics and code agent performance, we find significant distributional differences, including lower issue description quality and detail level, higher fix complexity, and most importantly up to 40% lower agent success rates.</description>

      <title>A Simple Approach to Constraint-Aware Imitation Learning with Application to Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guaranteeing constraint satisfaction is challenging in imitation learning (IL), particularly in tasks that require operating near a system's handling limits. Traditional IL methods often struggle to enforce constraints, leading to suboptimal performance in high-precision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach to incorporating safety into the IL objective. Through simulations, we empirically validate our approach on an autonomous racing task with both full-state and image feedback, demonstrating improved constraint satisfaction and greater consistency in task performance compared to a baseline method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLaMA 3.2 for Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for vulnerability detection, often outperforming traditional solutions. However, developing effective DL models requires large amounts of real-world data, which can be difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. To address this challenge, DiverseVul dataset has been curated as the largest dataset of vulnerable and non-vulnerable C/C++ functions extracted exclusively from real-world projects. Its goal is to provide high-quality, large-scale samples for training DL models. However, during our study several inconsistencies were identified in the raw dataset while applying pre-processing techniques, highlighting the need for a refined version. In this work, we present a refined version of DiverseVul dataset, which is used to fine-tune a large language model, LLaMA 3.2, for vulnerability detection. Experimental results show that the use of pre-processing techniques led to an improvement in performance, with the model achieving an F1-Score of 66%, a competitive result when compared to our baseline, which achieved a 47% F1-Score in software vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>Joint Explainability-Performance Optimization With Surrogate Models for AI-Driven Edge Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI is a crucial component for edge services, as it ensures reliable decision making based on complex AI models. Surrogate models are a prominent approach of XAI where human-interpretable models, such as a linear regression model, are trained to approximate a complex (black-box) model's predictions. This paper delves into the balance between the predictive accuracy of complex AI models and their approximation by surrogate ones, advocating that both these models benefit from being learned simultaneously. We derive a joint (bi-level) training scheme for both models and we introduce a new algorithm based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) to simultaneously minimize both the complex model's prediction error and the error between its outputs and those of the surrogate. Our approach leads to improvements that exceed 99% in the approximation of the black-box model through the surrogate one, as measured by the metric of Fidelity, for a compromise of less than 3% absolute reduction in the black-box model's predictive accuracy, compared to single-task and multi-task learning baselines. By improving Fidelity, we can derive more trustworthy explanations of the complex model's outcomes from the surrogate, enabling reliable AI applications for intelligent services at the network edge.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Language Models that Benefit for All: Benchmarking Group Fairness in Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful and accessible to human users, ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups, i.e., group fairness, is a critical ethical concern. However, current fairness and bias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional group fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the non-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same across different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups, however, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes impractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final output without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in LLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For finetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned reward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the LLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias. Recognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of learned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to benchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt questions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically significant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward models (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group fairness.</description>

      <title>Training Domain Draft Models for Speculative Decoding: Best Practices and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</description>

      <title>A primer on optimal transport for causal inference with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of optimal transportation has developed into a powerful and elegant framework for comparing probability distributions, with wide-ranging applications in all areas of science. The fundamental idea of analyzing probabilities by comparing their underlying state space naturally aligns with the core idea of causal inference, where understanding and quantifying counterfactual states is paramount. Despite this intuitive connection, explicit research at the intersection of optimal transport and causal inference is only beginning to develop. Yet, many foundational models in causal inference have implicitly relied on optimal transport principles for decades, without recognizing the underlying connection. Therefore, the goal of this review is to offer an introduction to the surprisingly deep existing connections between optimal transport and the identification of causal effects with observational data -- where optimal transport is not just a set of potential tools, but actually builds the foundation of model assumptions. As a result, this review is intended to unify the language and notation between different areas of statistics, mathematics, and econometrics, by pointing out these existing connections, and to explore novel problems and directions for future work in both areas derived from this realization.</description>

      <title>AgriField3D: A Curated 3D Point Cloud and Procedural Model Dataset of Field-Grown Maize from a Diversity Panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D) agricultural research, particularly for maize, has been limited by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present AgriField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/AgriField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset comprises over 1,000 high-quality point clouds collected using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner, complemented by procedural models that provide structured, parametric representations of maize plants. These procedural models, generated using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and optimized via a two-step process combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and differentiable programming, enable precise, scalable reconstructions of leaf surfaces and plant architectures. To enhance usability, we performed graph-based segmentation to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. We also conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset further includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled versions (100k, 50k, 10k points) optimized for various computational needs. By integrating point cloud data of field grown plants with high-fidelity procedural models and ensuring meticulous manual validation, AgriField3D provides a comprehensive foundation for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical societal consideration in the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL): ensuring equitable outcomes across different demographic groups in multi-task settings. While previous work has explored fairness in single-task RL, many real-world applications are multi-task in nature and require policies to maintain fairness across all tasks. We introduce a novel formulation of multi-task group fairness in RL and propose a constrained optimization algorithm that explicitly enforces fairness constraints across multiple tasks simultaneously. We have shown that our proposed algorithm does not violate fairness constraints with high probability and with sublinear regret in the finite-horizon episodic setting. Through experiments in RiverSwim and MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that our approach better ensures group fairness across multiple tasks compared to previous methods that lack explicit multi-task fairness constraints in both the finite-horizon setting and the infinite-horizon setting. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves smaller fairness gaps while maintaining comparable returns across different demographic groups and tasks, suggesting its potential for addressing fairness concerns in real-world multi-task RL applications.</description>

      <title>HalluVerse25: Fine-grained Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for LLM Hallucinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various contexts, yet remain prone to generating non-factual content, commonly referred to as "hallucinations". The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types, including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.</description>

      <title>CIMAGE: Exploiting the Conditional Independence in Masked Graph Auto-encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods encapsulating relational information via masking in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance. However, most existing approaches rely on random masking strategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture task-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an inability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components while ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks. Conditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to downstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel approach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking strategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor decomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence pseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework, the pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from the information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further supports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by demonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear separability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the advantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node classification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model highlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL methodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do two individuals differ when performing the same action? In this work, we introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many applications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on this new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences and 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. By analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key challenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and fine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff method, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage utilizing specialized foundation models. To encourage future research in this new task, we release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/VidDiffBench and code at http://jmhb0.github.io/viddiff.</description>

Abstract: Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early stages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data availability) can permanently impair the learning performance of the global model owned by the model owner (i.e., the cloud server). However, strategies to motivate clients with high-quality contributions to join the FL training process and share trained model updates during CLPs remain underexplored. Additionally, existing incentive mechanisms in FL treat all training periods equally, which consequently fails to motivate clients to participate early. Compounding this challenge is the cloud's limited knowledge of client training capabilities due to privacy regulations, leading to information asymmetry. Therefore, in this article, we propose a time-aware incentive mechanism, called Right Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially during CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud in FL. Specifically, the cloud utility function captures the trade-off between the achieved model performance and payments allocated for clients' contributions, while accounting for clients' time and system capabilities, efforts, joining time, and rewards. Then, we analytically derive the optimal contract for the cloud and devise a CLP-aware mechanism to incentivize early participation and efforts while maximizing cloud utility, even under information asymmetry. By providing the right reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality contributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that R3T increases cloud utility and is more economically effective than benchmarks. Notably, our proof-of-concept results show up to a 47.6% reduction in the total number of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while reaching competitive test accuracies compared with incentive mechanism benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MapQA: Open-domain Geospatial Question Answering on Map Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial question answering (QA) is a fundamental task in navigation and point of interest (POI) searches. While existing geospatial QA datasets exist, they are limited in both scale and diversity, often relying solely on textual descriptions of geo-entities without considering their geometries. A major challenge in scaling geospatial QA datasets for reasoning lies in the complexity of geospatial relationships, which require integrating spatial structures, topological dependencies, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities that most text-based QA datasets lack. To address these limitations, we introduce MapQA, a novel dataset that not only provides question-answer pairs but also includes the geometries of geo-entities referenced in the questions. MapQA is constructed using SQL query templates to extract question-answer pairs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for two study regions: Southern California and Illinois. It consists of 3,154 QA pairs spanning nine question types that require geospatial reasoning, such as neighborhood inference and geo-entity type identification. Compared to existing datasets, MapQA expands both the number and diversity of geospatial question types. We explore two approaches to tackle this challenge: (1) a retrieval-based language model that ranks candidate geo-entities by embedding similarity, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that generates SQL queries from natural language questions and geo-entity attributes, which are then executed against an OSM database. Our findings indicate that retrieval-based methods effectively capture concepts like closeness and direction but struggle with questions that require explicit computations (e.g., distance calculations). LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini) excel at generating SQL queries for one-hop reasoning but face challenges with multi-hop reasoning, highlighting a key bottleneck in advancing geospatial QA systems.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Loss for Accurate and Anatomically Consistent Cardiac Mesh Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate cardiac mesh reconstruction from volumetric data is essential for personalized cardiac modeling and clinical analysis. However, existing deformation-based approaches are prone to topological inconsistencies, particularly membrane penetration, which undermines the anatomical plausibility of the reconstructed mesh. To address this issue, we introduce Topology-Preserving Mesh Loss (TPM Loss), a novel loss function that explicitly enforces topological constraints during mesh deformation. By identifying topology-violating points, TPM Loss ensures spatially consistent reconstructions. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI datasets show that TPM Loss reduces topology violations by up to 93.1% while maintaining high segmentation accuracy (DSC: 89.1%-92.9%) and improving mesh fidelity (Chamfer Distance reduction up to 0.26 mm). These results demonstrate that TPM Loss effectively prevents membrane penetration and significantly improves cardiac mesh quality, enabling more accurate and anatomically consistent cardiac reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Measuring directional bias amplification in image captions using predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</description>

      <title>LLMIdxAdvis: Resource-Efficient Index Advisor Utilizing Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Index recommendation is essential for improving query performance in database management systems (DBMSs) through creating an optimal set of indexes under specific constraints. Traditional methods, such as heuristic and learning-based approaches, are effective but face challenges like lengthy recommendation time, resource-intensive training, and poor generalization across different workloads and database schemas. To address these issues, we propose LLMIdxAdvis, a resource-efficient index advisor that uses large language models (LLMs) without extensive fine-tuning. LLMIdxAdvis frames index recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence task, taking target workload, storage constraint, and corresponding database environment as input, and directly outputting recommended indexes. It constructs a high-quality demonstration pool offline, using GPT-4-Turbo to synthesize diverse SQL queries and applying integrated heuristic methods to collect both default and refined labels. During recommendation, these demonstrations are ranked to inject database expertise via in-context learning. Additionally, LLMIdxAdvis extracts workload features involving specific column statistical information to strengthen LLM's understanding, and introduces a novel inference scaling strategy combining vertical scaling (via ''Index-Guided Major Voting'' and Best-of-N) and horizontal scaling (through iterative ''self-optimization'' with database feedback) to enhance reliability. Experiments on 3 OLAP and 2 real-world benchmarks reveal that LLMIdxAdvis delivers competitive index recommendation with reduced runtime, and generalizes effectively across different workloads and database schemas.</description>

      <title>Safety Guardrails for LLM-Enabled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.</description>

      <title>FunGraph: Functionality Aware 3D Scene Graphs for Language-Prompted Scene Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of 3D scene graphs is increasingly recognized as a powerful semantic and hierarchical representation of the environment. Current approaches often address this at a coarse, object-level resolution. In contrast, our goal is to develop a representation that enables robots to directly interact with their environment by identifying both the location of functional interactive elements and how these can be used. To achieve this, we focus on detecting and storing objects at a finer resolution, focusing on affordance-relevant parts. The primary challenge lies in the scarcity of data that extends beyond instance-level detection and the inherent difficulty of capturing detailed object features using robotic sensors. We leverage currently available 3D resources to generate 2D data and train a detector, which is then used to augment the standard 3D scene graph generation pipeline. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves functional element segmentation comparable to state-of-the-art 3D models and that our augmentation enables task-driven affordance grounding with higher accuracy than the current solutions.</description>

      <title>Visual and Text Prompt Segmentation: A Novel Multi-Model Framework for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel-level segmentation is essential in remote sensing, where foundational vision models like CLIP and Segment Anything Model(SAM) have demonstrated significant capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks. Despite their advances, challenges specific to remote sensing remain substantial. Firstly, The SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and making post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed for global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local objects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate recognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly, both models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing the likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO, CLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation. The Grounding DINO+(GD+) module generates initial candidate bounding boxes, while the CLIP Filter++(CLIP++) module uses a combination of visual and textual prompts to refine and filter out irrelevant object bounding boxes, ensuring that only pertinent objects are considered. Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes serve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise segmentation. Our VTPSeg is validated by experimental and ablation study results on five popular remote sensing image segmentation datasets.</description>

      <title>Crowdsource, Crawl, or Generate? Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Learning with Autoregressive Chain of Thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given base class of sequence-to-next-token generators, we consider learning prompt-to-answer mappings obtained by iterating a fixed, time-invariant generator for multiple steps, thus generating a chain-of-thought, and then taking the final token as the answer. We formalize the learning problems both when the chain-of-thought is observed and when training only on prompt-answer pairs, with the chain-of-thought latent. We analyze the sample and computational complexity both in terms of general properties of the base class (e.g. its VC dimension) and for specific base classes such as linear thresholds. We present a simple base class that allows for universal representability and computationally tractable chain-of-thought learning. Central to our development is that time invariance allows for sample complexity that is independent of the length of the chain-of-thought. Attention arises naturally in our construction.</description>

      <title>7DGS: Unified Spatial-Temporal-Angular Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with view-dependent effects remains a fundamental challenge in computer graphics. While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have shown promising results separately handling dynamic scenes (4DGS) and view-dependent effects (6DGS), no existing method unifies these capabilities while maintaining real-time performance. We present 7D Gaussian Splatting (7DGS), a unified framework representing scene elements as seven-dimensional Gaussians spanning position (3D), time (1D), and viewing direction (3D). Our key contribution is an efficient conditional slicing mechanism that transforms 7D Gaussians into view- and time-conditioned 3D Gaussians, maintaining compatibility with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines while enabling joint optimization. Experiments demonstrate that 7DGS outperforms prior methods by up to 7.36 dB in PSNR while achieving real-time rendering (401 FPS) on challenging dynamic scenes with complex view-dependent effects.

      <title>EFPC: Towards Efficient and Flexible Prompt Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse, complex tasks. However, extensive token counts lead to high computational and financial burdens. To address this, we propose Efficient and Flexible Prompt Compression (EFPC), a novel method unifying task-aware and task-agnostic compression for a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EFPC uses GPT-4 to generate compressed prompts and integrates them with original prompts for training. During training and inference, we selectively prepend user instructions and compress prompts based on predicted probabilities. EFPC is highly data-efficient, achieving significant performance with minimal data.

      <title>Hierarchical Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Multi-Modal Manipulation using Tight Convex Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing trajectories for manipulation through contact is challenging as it requires reasoning of object \&amp; robot trajectories as well as complex contact sequences simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \&amp; object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.</description>

      <title>Provable Zero-Shot Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study offline reinforcement learning (RL) with zero-shot generalization property (ZSG), where the agent has access to an offline dataset including experiences from different environments, and the goal of the agent is to train a policy over the training environments which performs well on test environments without further interaction. Existing work showed that classical offline RL fails to generalize to new, unseen environments. We propose pessimistic empirical risk minimization (PERM) and pessimistic proximal policy optimization (PPPO), which leverage pessimistic policy evaluation to guide policy learning and enhance generalization. We show that both PERM and PPPO are capable of finding a near-optimal policy with ZSG. Our result serves as a first step in understanding the foundation of the generalization phenomenon in offline reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Estimation of Lipschitz Constants for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Decision Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for efficiently and accurately estimating Lipschitz constants in hybrid quantum-classical decision models. Our approach integrates classical neural network with quantum variational circuits to address critical issues in learning theory such as fairness verification, robust training, and generalization.
  By a unified convex optimization formulation, we extend existing classical methods to capture the interplay between classical and quantum layers. This integrated strategy not only provide a tight bound on the Lipschitz constant but also improves computational efficiency with respect to the previous methods.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Injecting Imbalance Sensitivity for Multi-Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for deploying deep learning models in real-life applications. Recent studies have proposed optimization-based learning paradigms to establish task-shared representations in MTL. However, our paper empirically argues that these studies, specifically gradient-based ones, primarily emphasize the conflict issue while neglecting the potentially more significant impact of imbalance/dominance in MTL. In line with this perspective, we enhance the existing baseline method by injecting imbalance-sensitivity through the imposition of constraints on the projected norms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IMbalance-sensitive Gradient (IMGrad) descent method, we evaluate it on multiple mainstream MTL benchmarks, encompassing supervised learning tasks as well as reinforcement learning. The experimental results consistently demonstrate competitive performance.</description>

      <title>MoRE: Unlocking Scalability in Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing versatile quadruped robots that can smoothly perform various actions and tasks in real-world environments remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model, mixture of robotic experts (MoRE), for quadruped robots that aim to introduce reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning large-scale VLA models with a large amount of mixed-quality data. MoRE integrates multiple low-rank adaptation modules as distinct experts within a dense multi-modal large language model (MLLM), forming a sparse-activated mixture-of-experts model. This design enables the model to effectively adapt to a wide array of downstream tasks. Moreover, we employ a reinforcement learning-based training objective to train our model as a Q-function after deeply exploring the structural properties of our tasks. Effective learning from automatically collected mixed-quality data enhances data efficiency and model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE outperforms all baselines across six different skills and exhibits superior generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios. We further validate our method in real-world scenarios, confirming the practicality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for future research on multi-task learning in quadruped robots.</description>

      <title>SKALD: Learning-Based Shot Assembly for Coherent Multi-Shot Video Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SKALD, a multi-shot video assembly method that constructs coherent video sequences from candidate shots with minimal reliance on text. Central to our approach is the Learned Clip Assembly (LCA) score, a learning-based metric that measures temporal and semantic relationships between shots to quantify narrative coherence. We tackle the exponential complexity of combining multiple shots with an efficient beam-search algorithm guided by the LCA score. To train our model effectively with limited human annotations, we propose two tasks for the LCA encoder: Shot Coherence Learning, which uses contrastive learning to distinguish coherent and incoherent sequences, and Feature Regression, which converts these learned representations into a real-valued coherence score. We develop two variants: a base SKALD model that relies solely on visual coherence and SKALD-text, which integrates auxiliary text information when available. Experiments on the VSPD and our curated MSV3C datasets show that SKALD achieves an improvement of up to 48.6% in IoU and a 43% speedup over the state-of-the-art methods. A user study further validates our approach, with 45% of participants favoring SKALD-assembled videos, compared to 22% preferring text-based assembly methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bias in over 100 Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate bias trends in text-to-image generative models over time, focusing on the increasing availability of models through open platforms like Hugging Face. While these platforms democratize AI, they also facilitate the spread of inherently biased models, often shaped by task-specific fine-tuning. Ensuring ethical and transparent AI deployment requires robust evaluation frameworks and quantifiable bias metrics. To this end, we assess bias across three key dimensions: (i) distribution bias, (ii) generative hallucination, and (iii) generative miss-rate. Analyzing over 100 models, we reveal how bias patterns evolve over time and across generative tasks. Our findings indicate that artistic and style-transferred models exhibit significant bias, whereas foundation models, benefiting from broader training distributions, are becoming progressively less biased. By identifying these systemic trends, we contribute a large-scale evaluation corpus to inform bias research and mitigation strategies, fostering more responsible AI development.

      <title>In Prospect and Retrospect: Reflective Memory Management for Long-term Personalized Dialogue Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</description>

Abstract: Flow Matching and Transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation tasks, with recent work FlowAR [Ren et al., 2024] synergistically integrating both paradigms to advance synthesis fidelity. However, current FlowAR implementations remain constrained by first-order trajectory modeling during the generation process. This paper introduces a novel framework that systematically enhances flow autoregressive transformers through high-order supervision. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation showing that our High-Order FlowAR (HOFAR) demonstrates measurable improvements in generation quality compared to baseline models. The proposed approach advances the understanding of flow-based autoregressive modeling by introducing a systematic framework for analyzing trajectory dynamics through high-order expansion.</description>

      <title>ObjectMover: Generative Object Movement with Video Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of (1) a weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) loss and (2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decoupled structure of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL loss in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property along with a smoother weight function. This modification effectively alleviates convergence challenges in optimization, particularly for classes with high predicted scores in soft labels. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to reduce bias arising from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Generalized Kullback-Leibler (GKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and vision-language datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard -- RobustBench and competitive knowledge distillation performance across CIFAR/ImageNet models and CLIP models, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

      <title>Continual Learning for Multiple Modalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn knowledge of tasks observed in sequential time steps while mitigating the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Existing methods were proposed under the assumption of learning a single modality (e.g., image) over time, which limits their applicability in scenarios involving multiple modalities. In this work, we propose a novel continual learning framework that accommodates multiple modalities (image, video, audio, depth, and text). We train a model to align various modalities with text, leveraging its rich semantic information. However, this increases the risk of forgetting previously learned knowledge, exacerbated by the differing input traits of each task. To alleviate the overwriting of the previous knowledge of modalities, we propose a method for aggregating knowledge within and across modalities. The aggregated knowledge is obtained by assimilating new information through self-regularization within each modality and associating knowledge between modalities by prioritizing contributions from relevant modalities. Furthermore, we propose a strategy that re-aligns the embeddings of modalities to resolve biased alignment between modalities. We evaluate the proposed method in a wide range of continual learning scenarios using multiple datasets with different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ours outperforms existing methods in the scenarios, regardless of whether the identity of the modality is given.</description>

      <title>Degradation Self-Supervised Learning for Lithium-ion Battery Health Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Health evaluation for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) typically relies on constant charging/discharging protocols, often neglecting scenarios involving dynamic current profiles prevalent in electric vehicles. Conventional health indicators for LIBs also depend on the uniformity of measured data, restricting their adaptability to non-uniform conditions. In this study, a novel training strategy for estimating LIB health based on the paradigm of self-supervised learning is proposed. A multiresolution analysis technique, empirical wavelet transform, is utilized to decompose non-stationary voltage signals in the frequency domain. This allows the removal of ineffective components for the health evaluation model. The transformer neural network serves as the model backbone, and a loss function is designed to describe the capacity degradation behavior with the assumption that the degradation in LIBs across most operating conditions is inevitable and irreversible. The results show that the model can learn the aging characteristics by analyzing sequences of voltage and current profiles obtained at various time intervals from the same LIB cell. The proposed method is successfully applied to the Stanford University LIB aging dataset, derived from electric vehicle real driving profiles. Notably, this approach achieves an average correlation coefficient of 0.9 between the evaluated health index and the degradation of actual capacity, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing LIB health degradation. This research highlights the feasibility of training deep neural networks using unlabeled LIB data, offering cost-efficient means and unleashing the potential of the measured information.</description>

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to perform long-horizon mobile manipulation planning in real-world environments based on embodied perception and comprehension abilities has been a longstanding challenge. With the recent rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been a notable increase in the development of LLM-based planners. These approaches either utilize human-provided textual representations of the real world or heavily depend on prompt engineering to extract such representations, lacking the capability to quantitatively understand the environment, such as determining the feasibility of manipulating objects. To address these limitations, we present the Instruction-Augmented Long-Horizon Planning (IALP) system, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate feasible and optimal actions based on real-time sensor feedback, including grounded knowledge of the environment, in a closed-loop interaction. Distinct from prior works, our approach augments user instructions into PDDL problems by leveraging both the abstract reasoning capabilities of LLMs and grounding mechanisms. By conducting various real-world long-horizon tasks, each consisting of seven distinct manipulatory skills, our results demonstrate that the IALP system can efficiently solve these tasks with an average success rate exceeding 80%. Our proposed method can operate as a high-level planner, equipping robots with substantial autonomy in unstructured environments through the utilization of multi-modal sensor inputs.</description>

Abstract: Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is a crucial technique for intelligent communications and spectrum sharing in the next six-generation (6G) wireless communication networks. It can be utilized to enhance network performance and efficiency, improve quality of service (QoS), and improve network security and reliability. Additionally, WSR can be applied for military applications such as signal interception, signal race, and signal abduction. In the past decades, great efforts have been made for the research of WSR. Earlier works mainly focus on model-based methods, including likelihood-based (LB) and feature-based (FB) methods, which have taken the leading position for many years. With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent methods including machine learning-based (ML-based) and deep learning-based (DL-based) methods have been developed to extract the features of the received signals and perform the classification. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of WSR from the view of applications, main tasks, recent advances, datasets and evaluation metrics, challenges, and future directions. Specifically, intelligent WSR methods are introduced from the perspective of model, data, learning and implementation. Moreover, we analyze the challenges for WSR from the view of complex, dynamic, and open 6G wireless environments and discuss the future directions for WSR. This survey is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art WSR techniques and inspire new research directions for WSR in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Convergence Dynamics and Stabilization Strategies of Co-Evolving Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of synthetic data in training loops has raised concerns about model collapse, where generative models degrade when trained on their own outputs. While prior work focuses on this self-consuming process, we study an underexplored yet prevalent phenomenon: co-evolving generative models that shape each other's training through iterative feedback. This is common in multimodal AI ecosystems, such as social media platforms, where text models generate captions that guide image models, and the resulting images influence the future adaptation of the text model. We take a first step by analyzing such a system, modeling the text model as a multinomial distribution and the image model as a conditional multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our analysis uncovers three key results. First, when one model remains fixed, the other collapses: a frozen image model causes the text model to lose diversity, while a frozen text model leads to an exponential contraction of image diversity, though fidelity remains bounded. Second, in fully interactive systems, mutual reinforcement accelerates collapse, with image contraction amplifying text homogenization and vice versa, leading to a Matthew effect where dominant texts sustain higher image diversity while rarer texts collapse faster. Third, we analyze stabilization strategies implicitly introduced by real-world external influences. Random corpus injections for text models and user-content injections for image models prevent collapse while preserving both diversity and fidelity. Our theoretical findings are further validated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace: Fine-grained Face Understanding and Generation with Unified Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Stable World Models: Measuring and Addressing World Instability in Generative Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel study on enhancing the capability of preserving the content in world models, focusing on a property we term World Stability. Recent diffusion-based generative models have advanced the synthesis of immersive and realistic environments that are pivotal for applications such as reinforcement learning and interactive game engines. However, while these models excel in quality and diversity, they often neglect the preservation of previously generated scenes over time--a shortfall that can introduce noise into agent learning and compromise performance in safety-critical settings. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework that measures world stability by having world models perform a sequence of actions followed by their inverses to return to their initial viewpoint, thereby quantifying the consistency between the starting and ending observations. Our comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models reveals significant challenges in achieving high world stability. Moreover, we investigate several improvement strategies to enhance world stability. Our results underscore the importance of world stability in world modeling and provide actionable insights for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>MGHanD: Multi-modal Guidance for authentic Hand Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have achieved significant successes in T2I generation, providing realistic images from text prompts. Despite their capabilities, these models face persistent challenges in generating realistic human hands, often producing images with incorrect finger counts and structurally deformed hands. MGHanD addresses this challenge by applying multi-modal guidance during the inference process. For visual guidance, we employ a discriminator trained on a dataset comprising paired real and generated images with captions, derived from various hand-in-the-wild datasets. We also employ textual guidance with LoRA adapter, which learns the direction from `hands' towards more detailed prompts such as `natural hands', and `anatomically correct fingers' at the latent level. A cumulative hand mask which is gradually enlarged in the assigned time step is applied to the added guidance, allowing the hand to be refined while maintaining the rich generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. In the experiments, our method achieves superior hand generation qualities, without any specific conditions or priors. We carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with user studies, to showcase the benefits of our approach in producing high-quality hand images.</description>

      <title>FlowDPS: Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching is a recent state-of-the-art framework for generative modeling based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling. Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS) - which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient - into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation. By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture. Across four linear inverse problems, we confirm that FlowDPS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, all without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>Attention to Trajectory: Trajectory-Aware Open-Vocabulary Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Object Tracking (OV-MOT) aims to enable approaches to track objects without being limited to a predefined set of categories. Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>XAI4Extremes: An interpretable machine learning framework for understanding extreme-weather precursors under climate change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks.
  To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>ProTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key element of modern artificial intelligence, demonstrating the ability to address a wide range of language processing tasks at unprecedented levels of accuracy without the need of collecting problem-specific data. However, these versatile models face a significant challenge: both their training and inference processes require substantial computational resources, time, and memory. Consequently, optimizing this kind of models to minimize these requirements is crucial. In this article, we demonstrate that, with minimal resources and in a remarkably short time, it is possible to enhance a state-of-the-art model, specifically for a given language task, without compromising its overall capabilities using a relatively small pretrained LLM as a basis. Specifically, we present our use case, RigoChat 2, illustrating how LLMs can be adapted to achieve superior results in Spanish-language tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.</description>

      <title>OLMD: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) mainly stems from the presence of multi-orientational and long-term motions. However, current research overlooks these crucial aspects, significantly impacting accuracy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel CSLR framework: Orientation-aware Long-term Motion Decoupling (OLMD), which efficiently aggregates long-term motions and decouples multi-orientational signals into easily interpretable components. Specifically, our innovative Long-term Motion Aggregation (LMA) module filters out static redundancy while adaptively capturing abundant features of long-term motions. We further enhance orientation awareness by decoupling complex movements into horizontal and vertical components, allowing for motion purification in both orientations. Additionally, two coupling mechanisms are proposed: stage and cross-stage coupling, which together enrich multi-scale features and improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Experimentally, OLMD shows SOTA performance on three large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily. Notably, we improved the word error rate (WER) on PHOENIX14 by an absolute 1.6% compared to the previous SOTA</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present our work on DeepRAG, a specialized embedding model we built specifically for Hindi language in RAG systems. While LLMs have gotten really good at generating text, their performance in retrieval tasks still depends heavily on having quality embeddings - something that's been lacking for Hindi despite being one of the world's most spoken languages. We tackled this by creating embeddings from the ground up rather than just fine-tuning existing models. Our process involved collecting diverse Hindi texts (over 2.7M samples), training a custom SentencePiece tokenizer that actually understands Hindi morphology, designing transformer architecture with Hindi-specific attention mechanisms, and optimizing with contrastive learning. Results were honestly better than I expected - we saw a 23% improvement in retrieval precision compared to the multilingual models everyone's been using. The paper details our methodology, which I think could help others working with low-resource languages where the one-size-fits-all multilingual models fall short. We've also integrated our embeddings with LangChain to build complete Hindi RAG systems, which might be useful for practitioners. While there's still tons more to explore, I believe this work addresses a critical gap for Hindi NLP and demonstrates why language-specific approaches matter.</description>

      <title>CL-MVSNet: Unsupervised Multi-view Stereo with Dual-level Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have achieved promising progress recently. However, previous methods primarily depend on the photometric consistency assumption, which may suffer from two limitations: indistinguishable regions and view-dependent effects, e.g., low-textured areas and reflections. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new dual-level contrastive learning approach, named CL-MVSNet. Specifically, our model integrates two contrastive branches into an unsupervised MVS framework to construct additional supervisory signals. On the one hand, we present an image-level contrastive branch to guide the model to acquire more context awareness, thus leading to more complete depth estimation in indistinguishable regions. On the other hand, we exploit a scene-level contrastive branch to boost the representation ability, improving robustness to view-dependent effects. Moreover, to recover more accurate 3D geometry, we introduce an L0.5 photometric consistency loss, which encourages the model to focus more on accurate points while mitigating the gradient penalty of undesirable ones. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tanks&amp;Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among all end-to-end unsupervised MVS frameworks and outperforms its supervised counterpart by a considerable margin without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>EgoBlind: Towards Egocentric Visual Assistance for the Blind People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EgoBlind, the first egocentric VideoQA dataset collected from blind individuals to evaluate the assistive capabilities of contemporary multimodal large language models (MLLMs). EgoBlind comprises 1,210 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 4,927 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 15 leading MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy around 56\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and provide heuristic suggestions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.</description>

      <title>A Grey-box Text Attack Framework using Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI is a strong strategy implemented to understand complex black-box model predictions in a human interpretable language. It provides the evidence required to execute the use of trustworthy and reliable AI systems. On the other hand, however, it also opens the door to locating possible vulnerabilities in an AI model. Traditional adversarial text attack uses word substitution, data augmentation techniques and gradient-based attacks on powerful pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) variants to generate adversarial sentences. These attacks are generally whitebox in nature and not practical as they can be easily detected by humans E.g. Changing the word from "Poor" to "Rich". We proposed a simple yet effective Grey-box cum Black-box approach that does not require the knowledge of the model while using a set of surrogate Transformer/BERT models to perform the attack using Explainable AI techniques. As Transformers are the current state-of-the-art models for almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, an attack generated from BERT1 is transferable to BERT2. This transferability is made possible due to the attention mechanism in the transformer that allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in a sequence. Using the power of BERT generalisation via attention, we attempt to exploit how transformers learn by attacking a few surrogate transformer variants which are all based on a different architecture. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective to generate semantically good sentences by changing as little as one word that is not detectable by humans while still fooling other BERT models.</description>

      <title>Investigating Execution-Aware Language Models for Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code optimization is the process of enhancing code efficiency, while preserving its intended functionality. This process often requires a deep understanding of the code execution behavior at run-time to identify and address inefficiencies effectively. Recent studies have shown that language models can play a significant role in automating code optimization. However, these models may have insufficient knowledge of how code execute at run-time. To address this limitation, researchers have developed strategies that integrate code execution information into language models. These strategies have shown promise, enhancing the effectiveness of language models in various software engineering tasks. However, despite the close relationship between code execution behavior and efficiency, the specific impact of these strategies on code optimization remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how incorporating code execution information into language models affects their ability to optimize code. Specifically, we apply three different training strategies to incorporate four code execution aspects -- line executions, line coverage, branch coverage, and variable states -- into CodeT5+, a well-known language model for code. Our results indicate that execution-aware models provide limited benefits compared to the standard CodeT5+ model in optimizing code.</description>

      <title>Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</description>

      <title>MT-NAM: An Efficient and Adaptive Model for Epileptic Seizure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning algorithms employed in neural interface systems is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent therapeutic devices. However, current systems often utilize basic machine learning models that do not fully exploit the natural structure of brain signals. Additionally, existing learning models used for neural signal processing often demonstrate low speed and efficiency during inference. To address these challenges, this study introduces Micro Tree-based NAM (MT-NAM), a distilled model based on the recently proposed Neural Additive Models (NAM). The MT-NAM achieves a remarkable 100$\times$ improvement in inference speed compared to standard NAM, without compromising accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, which includes recordings from 24 patients with varying numbers of sessions and seizures. NAM achieves an 85.3\% window-based sensitivity and 95\% specificity. Interestingly, our proposed MT-NAM shows only a 2\% reduction in sensitivity compared to the original NAM. To regain this sensitivity, we utilize a test-time template adjuster (T3A) as an update mechanism, enabling our model to achieve higher sensitivity during test time by accommodating transient shifts in neural signals. With this online update approach, MT-NAM achieves the same sensitivity as the standard NAM while achieving approximately 50$\times$ acceleration in inference speed.</description>

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of grasping any object is essential for the development of general-purpose embodied intelligent robots. However, due to the high degree of freedom in dexterous hands and the vast diversity of objects, generating high-quality, usable grasping poses in a robust manner is a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DexGrasp Anything, a method that effectively integrates physical constraints into both the training and sampling phases of a diffusion-based generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance across nearly all open datasets. Additionally, we present a new dexterous grasping dataset containing over 3.4 million diverse grasping poses for more than 15k different objects, demonstrating its potential to advance universal dexterous grasping. The code of our method and our dataset will be publicly released soon.</description>

      <title>Adv-CPG: A Customized Portrait Generation Framework with Facial Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Customized Portrait Generation (CPG) methods, taking a facial image and a textual prompt as inputs, have attracted substantial attention. Although these methods generate high-fidelity portraits, they fail to prevent the generated portraits from being tracked and misused by malicious face recognition systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Customized Portrait Generation framework with facial Adversarial attacks (Adv-CPG). Specifically, to achieve facial privacy protection, we devise a lightweight local ID encryptor and an encryption enhancer. They implement progressive double-layer encryption protection by directly injecting the target identity and adding additional identity guidance, respectively. Furthermore, to accomplish fine-grained and personalized portrait generation, we develop a multi-modal image customizer capable of generating controlled fine-grained facial features. To the best of our knowledge, Adv-CPG is the first study that introduces facial adversarial attacks into CPG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Adv-CPG, e.g., the average attack success rate of the proposed Adv-CPG is 28.1% and 2.86% higher compared to the SOTA noise-based attack methods and unconstrained attack methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>OminiControl2: Efficient Conditioning for Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained control of text-to-image diffusion transformer models (DiT) remains a critical challenge for practical deployment. While recent advances such as OminiControl and others have enabled a controllable generation of diverse control signals, these methods face significant computational inefficiency when handling long conditional inputs. We present OminiControl2, an efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image generation. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic compression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the most semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional feature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and reuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve the original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while dramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that OminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to its predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\times$ speedup in multi-conditional generation scenarios. This efficiency enables the practical implementation of complex, multi-modal control for high-quality image synthesis with DiT models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Outpatient Referral: Problem Definition, Benchmarking and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.</description>

      <title>D3PO: Preference-Based Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, with recent advancements extending their applicability to discrete data. However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model as Meta-Surrogate for Data-Driven Many-Task Optimization: A Proof-of-Principle Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</description>

      <title>General-Purpose Aerial Intelligent Agents Empowered by Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) opens new frontiers for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), yet existing systems remain confined to predefined tasks due to hardware-software co-design challenges. This paper presents the first aerial intelligent agent capable of open-world task execution through tight integration of LLM-based reasoning and robotic autonomy. Our hardware-software co-designed system addresses two fundamental limitations: (1) Onboard LLM operation via an edge-optimized computing platform, achieving 5-6 tokens/sec inference for 14B-parameter models at 220W peak power; (2) A bidirectional cognitive architecture that synergizes slow deliberative planning (LLM task planning) with fast reactive control (state estimation, mapping, obstacle avoidance, and motion planning). Validated through preliminary results using our prototype, the system demonstrates reliable task planning and scene understanding in communication-constrained environments, such as sugarcane monitoring, power grid inspection, mine tunnel exploration, and biological observation applications. This work establishes a novel framework for embodied aerial artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between task planning and robotic autonomy in open environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Interpretable Reinforcement Learning by Distilling Policies into Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist applications of reinforcement learning like medicine where policies need to be ''interpretable'' by humans. User studies have shown that some policy classes might be more interpretable than others. However, it is costly to conduct human studies of policy interpretability. Furthermore, there is no clear definition of policy interpretabiliy, i.e., no clear metrics for interpretability and thus claims depend on the chosen definition. We tackle the problem of empirically evaluating policies interpretability without humans. Despite this lack of clear definition, researchers agree on the notions of ''simulatability'': policy interpretability should relate to how humans understand policy actions given states. To advance research in interpretable reinforcement learning, we contribute a new methodology to evaluate policy interpretability. This new methodology relies on proxies for simulatability that we use to conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of policy interpretability. We use imitation learning to compute baseline policies by distilling expert neural networks into small programs. We then show that using our methodology to evaluate the baselines interpretability leads to similar conclusions as user studies. We show that increasing interpretability does not necessarily reduce performances and can sometimes increase them. We also show that there is no policy class that better trades off interpretability and performance across tasks making it necessary for researcher to have methodologies for comparing policies interpretability.</description>

      <title>Prototype-based Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Blade Icing Detection in Wind Turbines with Class Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind farms, typically in high-latitude regions, face a high risk of blade icing. Traditional centralized training methods raise serious privacy concerns. To enhance data privacy in detecting wind turbine blade icing, traditional federated learning (FL) is employed. However, data heterogeneity, resulting from collections across wind farms in varying environmental conditions, impacts the model's optimization capabilities. Moreover, imbalances in wind turbine data lead to models that tend to favor recognizing majority classes, thus neglecting critical icing anomalies. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated prototype learning model for class-imbalanced data in heterogeneous environments to detect wind turbine blade icing. We also propose a contrastive supervised loss function to address the class imbalance problem. Experiments on real data from 20 turbines across two wind farms show our method outperforms five FL models and five class imbalance methods, with an average improvement of 19.64\% in \( mF_{\beta} \) and 5.73\% in \( m \)BA compared to the second-best method, BiFL.</description>

      <title>Adding Chocolate to Mint: Mitigating Metric Interference in Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As automatic metrics become increasingly stronger and widely adopted, the risk of unintentionally "gaming the metric" during model development rises. This issue is caused by metric interference (Mint), i.e., the use of the same or related metrics for both model tuning and evaluation. Mint can misguide practitioners into being overoptimistic about the performance of their systems: as system outputs become a function of the interfering metric, their estimated quality loses correlation with human judgments. In this work, we analyze two common cases of Mint in machine translation-related tasks: filtering of training data, and decoding with quality signals. Importantly, we find that Mint strongly distorts instance-level metric scores, even when metrics are not directly optimized for -- questioning the common strategy of leveraging a different, yet related metric for evaluation that is not used for tuning. To address this problem, we propose MintAdjust, a method for more reliable evaluation under Mint. On the WMT24 MT shared task test set, MintAdjust ranks translations and systems more accurately than state-of-the-art-metrics across a majority of language pairs, especially for high-quality systems. Furthermore, MintAdjust outperforms AutoRank, the ensembling method used by the organizers.</description>

Abstract: We present the Membership Inference Test Demonstrator, to emphasize the need for more transparent machine learning training processes. MINT is a technique for experimentally determining whether certain data has been used during the training of machine learning models. We conduct experiments with popular face recognition models and 5 public databases containing over 22M images. Promising results, up to 89% accuracy are achieved, suggesting that it is possible to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. Finally, we present a MINT platform as demonstrator of this technology aimed to promote transparency in AI training.</description>

      <title>Robust Latent Matters: Boosting Image Generation with Sampling Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the performance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation, its current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the tokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID). In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of reconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate latent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is proposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from the generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive benchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2 autoregressive generation models to validate our approach. The tokenizer trained with our proposed latent perturbation achieve a notable 1.60 gFID with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 3.45 gFID without CFG with a $\sim$400M generator.

      <description>arXiv:2503.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power indices are essential in assessing the contribution and influence of individual agents in multi-agent systems, providing crucial insights into collaborative dynamics and decision-making processes. While invaluable, traditional computational methods for exact or estimated power indices values require significant time and computational constraints, especially for large $(n\ge10)$ coalitions. These constraints have historically limited researchers' ability to analyse complex multi-agent interactions comprehensively. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach that efficiently estimates power indices for voting games, demonstrating comparable and often superiour performance to existing tools in terms of both speed and accuracy. This method not only addresses existing computational bottlenecks, but also enables rapid analysis of large coalitions, opening new avenues for multi-agent system research by overcoming previous computational limitations and providing researchers with a more accessible, scalable analytical tool.This increased efficiency will allow for the analysis of more complex and realistic multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>V-Max: Making RL practical for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets. V-Max integrates a set of observation and reward functions, transformer-based encoders, and training pipelines. Additionally, it includes adversarial evaluation settings and an extensive set of evaluation metrics. Through a large-scale benchmark, we analyze how network architectures, observation functions, training data, and reward shaping impact RL performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</description>

      <title>ICPR 2024 Competition on Rider Intention Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in the vehicle market has led to an alarming increase in road accidents. This underscores the critical importance of enhancing road safety measures, particularly for vulnerable road users like motorcyclists. Hence, we introduce the rider intention prediction (RIP) competition that aims to address challenges in rider safety by proactively predicting maneuvers before they occur, thereby strengthening rider safety. This capability enables the riders to react to the potential incorrect maneuvers flagged by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We collect a new dataset, namely, rider action anticipation dataset (RAAD) for the competition consisting of two tasks: single-view RIP and multi-view RIP. The dataset incorporates a spectrum of traffic conditions and challenging navigational maneuvers on roads with varying lighting conditions. For the competition, we received seventy-five registrations and five team submissions for inference of which we compared the methods of the top three performing teams on both the RIP tasks: one state-space model (Mamba2) and two learning-based approaches (SVM and CNN-LSTM). The results indicate that the state-space model outperformed the other methods across the entire dataset, providing a balanced performance across maneuver classes. The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best performance when using random sampling and SMOTE. However, the CNN-LSTM method underperformed, primarily due to class imbalance issues, particularly struggling with minority classes. This paper details the proposed RAAD dataset and provides a summary of the submissions for the RIP 2024 competition.</description>

      <title>Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of Industry 4.0 technologies requires robust and comprehensive standardization to ensure interoperability, safety and efficiency in the Industry of the Future. This paper examines the fundamental role and functionality of standardization, with a particular focus on its importance in Europe's regulatory framework. Based on this, selected topics in context of standardization activities in context intelligent manufacturing and digital twins are highlighted and, by that, an overview of the Industry 4.0 standards framework is provided. This paper serves both as an informative guide to the existing standards in Industry 4.0 with respect to Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins, and as a call to action for increased cooperation between standardization bodies and the research community. By fostering such collaboration, we aim to facilitate the continued development and implementation of standards that will drive innovation and progress in the manufacturing sector.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MoE Model Inference with Expert Sharding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art results in language modeling but suffer from inefficient hardware utilization due to imbalanced token routing and communication overhead. While prior work has focused on optimizing MoE training and decoder architectures, inference for encoder-based MoE models in a multi-GPU with expert parallelism setting remains underexplored. We introduce MoEShard, an inference system that achieves perfect load balancing through tensor sharding of MoE experts. Unlike existing approaches that rely on heuristic capacity factors or drop tokens, MoEShard evenly distributes computation across GPUs and ensures full token retention, maximizing utilization regardless of routing skewness. We achieve this through a strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces idle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments. Furthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert computations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against DeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to 6.4$\times$ in time to first token (TTFT). Our results show that tensor sharding, when properly applied to experts, is a viable and effective strategy for efficient MoE inference.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Ride-Pooling Operations with Extended Pickup and Drop-Off Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ride-Pool Matching Problem (RMP) is central to on-demand ride-pooling services, where vehicles must be matched with multiple requests while adhering to service constraints such as pickup delays, detour limits, and vehicle capacity. Most existing RMP solutions assume passengers are picked up and dropped off at their original locations, neglecting the potential for passengers to walk to nearby spots to meet vehicles. This assumption restricts the optimization potential in ride-pooling operations. In this paper, we propose a novel matching method that incorporates extended pickup and drop-off areas for passengers. We first design a tree-based approach to efficiently generate feasible matches between passengers and vehicles. Next, we optimize vehicle routes to cover all designated pickup and drop-off locations while minimizing total travel distance. Finally, we employ dynamic assignment strategies to achieve optimal matching outcomes. Experiments on city-scale taxi datasets demonstrate that our method improves the number of served requests by up to 13\% and average travel distance by up to 21\% compared to leading existing solutions, underscoring the potential of leveraging passenger mobility to significantly enhance ride-pooling service efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Triple-Inertial Accelerated Alternating Optimization Method for Deep Learning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has achieved remarkable success in training deep learning models. However, it has several limitations, including susceptibility to vanishing gradients, sensitivity to input data, and a lack of robust theoretical guarantees. In recent years, alternating minimization (AM) methods have emerged as a promising alternative for model training by employing gradient-free approaches to iteratively update model parameters. Despite their potential, these methods often exhibit slow convergence rates. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Triple-Inertial Accelerated Alternating Minimization (TIAM) framework for neural network training. The TIAM approach incorporates a triple-inertial acceleration strategy with a specialized approximation method, facilitating targeted acceleration of different terms in each sub-problem optimization. This integration improves the efficiency of convergence, achieving superior performance with fewer iterations. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis of the TIAM algorithm, including its global convergence properties and convergence rate. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the TIAM method, showing significant improvements in generalization capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, particularly when applied to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants.</description>

      <title>GTR: Guided Thought Reinforcement Prevents Thought Collapse in RL-based VLM Agent Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</description>

      <title>Mellow: a small audio language model for reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text. Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters. However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices. To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning. Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities. For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs). To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models. It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%). The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance. Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning.</description>

      <title>DAFE: LLM-Based Evaluation Through Dynamic Arbitration for Free-Form Question-Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) free-form generated responses remains a challenge due to their diverse and open-ended nature. Traditional supervised signal-based automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or handle the variability of open-ended responses, while human evaluation, though reliable, is resource-intensive. Leveraging LLMs as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. Taking advantage of these capabilities, we propose the Dynamic Arbitration Framework for Evaluation (DAFE), which employs two primary LLM-as-judges and engages a third arbitrator only in cases of disagreements. This selective arbitration prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands compared to conventional majority voting. DAFE utilizes task-specific reference answers with dynamic arbitration to enhance judgment accuracy, resulting in significant improvements in evaluation metrics such as Macro F1 and Cohen's Kappa. Through experiments, including a comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate DAFE's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating free-form model outputs.</description>

      <title>Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MoE-Loco, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework for multitask locomotion for legged robots. Our method enables a single policy to handle diverse terrains, including bars, pits, stairs, slopes, and baffles, while supporting quadrupedal and bipedal gaits. Using MoE, we mitigate the gradient conflicts that typically arise in multitask reinforcement learning, improving both training efficiency and performance. Our experiments demonstrate that different experts naturally specialize in distinct locomotion behaviors, which can be leveraged for task migration and skill composition. We further validate our approach in both simulation and real-world deployment, showcasing its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>When Discourse Stalls: Moving Past Five Semantic Stopsigns about Generative AI in Design Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This essay examines how Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming design practices and how discourse often falls into over-simplified narratives that impede meaningful research and practical progress. We identify and deconstruct five prevalent "semantic stopsigns" -- reductive framings about GenAI in design that halt deeper inquiry and limit productive engagement. Reflecting upon two expert workshops at ACM conferences and semi-structured interviews with design practitioners, we analyze how these stopsigns manifest in research and practice. Our analysis develops mid-level knowledge that bridges theoretical discourse and practical implementation, helping designers and researchers interrogate common assumptions about GenAI in their own contexts. By recasting these stopsigns into more nuanced frameworks, we provide the design research community with practical approaches for thinking about and working with these emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>MsaMIL-Net: An End-to-End Multi-Scale Aware Multiple Instance Learning Network for Efficient Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.
  Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</description>

      <title>BiasEdit: Debiasing Stereotyped Language Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have established that language models manifest stereotyped biases. Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</description>

      <title>EMMOE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing autonomous home robots controlled by natural language has long been a pursuit of human. While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), which requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect EMMOE-100, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design HomieBot, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate HomieBot's performance and the evaluation of different models and policies.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entorhinal-hippocampal formation is the mammalian brain's navigation system, encoding both physical and abstract spaces via grid cells. This system is well-studied in neuroscience, and its efficiency and versatility make it attractive for applications in robotics and machine learning. While continuous attractor networks (CANs) successfully model entorhinal grid cells for encoding physical space, integrating both continuous spatial and abstract spatial computations into a unified framework remains challenging. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a mechanistic model for versatile information processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal formation inspired by CANs and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), a neuro-symbolic computing framework. The novel grid-cell VSA (GC-VSA) model employs a spatially structured encoding scheme with 3D neuronal modules mimicking the discrete scales and orientations of grid cell modules, reproducing their characteristic hexagonal receptive fields. In experiments, the model demonstrates versatility in spatial and abstract tasks: (1) accurate path integration for tracking locations, (2) spatio-temporal representation for querying object locations and temporal relations, and (3) symbolic reasoning using family trees as a structured test case for hierarchical relationships.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Intracranial Hemorrhage Classification in CT Scans Using an Entropy-Aware Fuzzy Integral Strategy for Adaptive Scan-Level Decision Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical medical emergency caused by the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding within the skull. Accurate and timely classification of hemorrhage subtypes is essential for effective clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced pyramid vision transformer (PVT)-based model, leveraging its hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture both local and global spatial dependencies in brain CT scans. Instead of processing all extracted features indiscriminately, A SHAP-based feature selection method is employed to identify the most discriminative components, which are then used as a latent feature space to train a boosting neural network, reducing computational complexity. We introduce an entropy-aware aggregation strategy along with a fuzzy integral operator to fuse information across multiple CT slices, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable scan-level diagnosis by accounting for inter-slice dependencies. Experimental results show that our PVT-based framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and robustness. By combining SHAP-driven feature selection, transformer-based modeling, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for decision fusion, our method offers a scalable and computationally efficient AI-driven solution for automated ICH subtype classification.</description>

      <title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Instruction-Following Retrievers for Malicious Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction-following retrievers have been widely adopted alongside LLMs in real-world applications, but little work has investigated the safety risks surrounding their increasing search capabilities. We empirically study the ability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and when used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we investigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find that given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for &gt;50% of queries) select relevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for 61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with instruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can be surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we show that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious requests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary, our findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing retriever capability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Word Sense Disambiguation Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a historical task in computational linguistics that has received much attention over the years. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), interest in this task (in its classical definition) has decreased. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs on the WSD task. We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to re-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM must generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set of predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended benchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current state-of-the-art methods. However, a fine-tuned model with a medium number of parameters outperforms all other models, including the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Generating Robot Constitutions &amp; Benchmarks for Semantic Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until recently, robotics safety research was predominantly about collision avoidance and hazard reduction in the immediate vicinity of a robot. Since the advent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable of higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions with humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or jail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical contact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making semantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in this paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the ASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for evaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot brains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and image generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world visual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a framework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to steer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel auto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of behavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on behavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and specificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and demonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional actions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using generated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and human-written constitutions.

      <title>MEAT: Multiview Diffusion Model for Human Generation on Megapixels with Mesh Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiview diffusion models have shown considerable success in image-to-3D generation for general objects. However, when applied to human data, existing methods have yet to deliver promising results, largely due to the challenges of scaling multiview attention to higher resolutions. In this paper, we explore human multiview diffusion models at the megapixel level and introduce a solution called mesh attention to enable training at 1024x1024 resolution. Using a clothed human mesh as a central coarse geometric representation, the proposed mesh attention leverages rasterization and projection to establish direct cross-view coordinate correspondences. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of multiview attention while maintaining cross-view consistency. Building on this foundation, we devise a mesh attention block and combine it with keypoint conditioning to create our human-specific multiview diffusion model, MEAT. In addition, we present valuable insights into applying multiview human motion videos for diffusion training, addressing the longstanding issue of data scarcity. Extensive experiments show that MEAT effectively generates dense, consistent multiview human images at the megapixel level, outperforming existing multiview diffusion methods.</description>

      <title>REGEN: Learning Compact Video Embedding with (Re-)Generative Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</description>

      <title>AgentOrca: A Dual-System Framework to Evaluate Language Agents on Operational Routine and Constraint Adherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As language agents progressively automate critical tasks across domains, their ability to operate within operational constraints and safety protocols becomes essential. While extensive research has demonstrated these agents' effectiveness in downstream task completion, their reliability in following operational procedures and constraints remains largely unexplored. To this end, we present AgentOrca, a dual-system framework for evaluating language agents' compliance with operational constraints and routines. Our framework encodes action constraints and routines through both natural language prompts for agents and corresponding executable code serving as ground truth for automated verification. Through an automated pipeline of test case generation and evaluation across five real-world domains, we quantitatively assess current language agents' adherence to operational constraints. Our findings reveal notable performance gaps among state-of-the-art models, with large reasoning models like o1 demonstrating superior compliance while others show significantly lower performance, particularly when encountering complex constraints or user persuasion attempts.</description>

      <title>GarmentCrafter: Progressive Novel View Synthesis for Single-View 3D Garment Reconstruction and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GarmentCrafter, a new approach that enables non-professional users to create and modify 3D garments from a single-view image. While recent advances in image generation have facilitated 2D garment design, creating and editing 3D garments remains challenging for non-professional users. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction often rely on pre-trained generative models to synthesize novel views conditioning on the reference image and camera pose, yet they lack cross-view consistency, failing to capture the internal relationships across different views. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through progressive depth prediction and image warping to approximate novel views. Subsequently, we train a multi-view diffusion model to complete occluded and unknown clothing regions, informed by the evolving camera pose. By jointly inferring RGB and depth, GarmentCrafter enforces inter-view coherence and reconstructs precise geometries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual fidelity and inter-view coherence compared to state-of-the-art single-view 3D garment reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>CoLMDriver: LLM-based Negotiation Benefits Cooperative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios. Code will be released on https://github.com/cxliu0314/CoLMDriver.</description>

      <title>Perplexity Trap: PLM-Based Retrievers Overrate Low Perplexity Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have found that PLM-based retrieval models exhibit a preference for LLM-generated content, assigning higher relevance scores to these documents even when their semantic quality is comparable to human-written ones. This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem. However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored. In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher. Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task. Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC). CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score. Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.

      <description>arXiv:2208.13687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional knowledge representations in reinforcement learning (RL) facilitate modular, interpretable, and safe task specifications. However, generating compositional models requires the characterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositionality feature, especially in the case of functional decompositions. Using a categorical point of view, we develop a knowledge representation framework for a compositional theory of RL. Our approach relies on the theoretical study of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$, whose objects are Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. The categorical semantics models the compositionality of tasks through the application of pushout operations akin to combining puzzle pieces. As a practical application of these pushout operations, we introduce zig-zag diagrams that rely on the compositional guarantees engendered by the category $\mathsf{MDP}$. We further prove that properties of the category $\mathsf{MDP}$ unify concepts, such as enforcing safety requirements and exploiting symmetries, generalizing previous abstraction theories for RL.</description>

      <title>X-SHIELD: Regularization for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become integral across domains, the demand for explainability grows, the called eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Existing efforts primarily focus on generating and evaluating explanations for black-box models while a critical gap in directly enhancing models remains through these evaluations. It is important to consider the potential of this explanation process to improve model quality with a feedback on training as well. XAI may be used to improve model performance while boosting its explainability. Under this view, this paper introduces Transformation - Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics (T-SHIELD), a regularization family designed to improve model quality by hiding features of input, forcing the model to generalize without those features. Within this family, we propose the XAI - SHIELD(X-SHIELD), a regularization for explainable artificial intelligence, which uses explanations to select specific features to hide. In contrast to conventional approaches, X-SHIELD regularization seamlessly integrates into the objective function enhancing model explainability while also improving performance. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets underscores X-SHIELD's effectiveness in improving performance and overall explainability. The improvement is validated through experiments comparing models with and without the X-SHIELD regularization, with further analysis exploring the rationale behind its design choices. This establishes X-SHIELD regularization as a promising pathway for developing reliable artificial intelligence regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I generalize acyclic deterministic structural causal models to the nondeterministic case and argue that this offers an improved semantics for counterfactuals. The standard, deterministic, semantics developed by Halpern (and based on the initial proposal of Galles &amp; Pearl) assumes that for each assignment of values to parent variables there is a unique assignment to their child variable, and it assumes that the actual world (an assignment of values to all variables of a model) specifies a unique counterfactual world for each intervention. Both assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore I drop both of them in my proposal. I do so by allowing multi-valued functions in the structural equations. In addition, I adjust the semantics so that the solutions to the equations that obtained in the actual world are preserved in any counterfactual world. I provide a sound and complete axiomatization of the resulting logic and compare it to the standard one by Halpern and to more recent proposals that are closer to mine. Finally, I extend these models to the probabilistic case and show that they open up the way to identifying counterfactuals even in Causal Bayesian Networks.</description>

      <title>AI Data Readiness Inspector (AIDRIN) for Quantitative Assessment of Data Readiness for AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Garbage In Garbage Out" is a universally agreed quote by computer scientists from various domains, including Artificial Intelligence (AI). As data is the fuel for AI, models trained on low-quality, biased data are often ineffective. Computer scientists who use AI invest a considerable amount of time and effort in preparing the data for AI. However, there are no standard methods or frameworks for assessing the "readiness" of data for AI. To provide a quantifiable assessment of the readiness of data for AI processes, we define parameters of AI data readiness and introduce AIDRIN (AI Data Readiness Inspector). AIDRIN is a framework covering a broad range of readiness dimensions available in the literature that aid in evaluating the readiness of data quantitatively and qualitatively. AIDRIN uses metrics in traditional data quality assessment such as completeness, outliers, and duplicates for data evaluation. Furthermore, AIDRIN uses metrics specific to assess data for AI, such as feature importance, feature correlations, class imbalance, fairness, privacy, and FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principle compliance. AIDRIN provides visualizations and reports to assist data scientists in further investigating the readiness of data. The AIDRIN framework enhances the efficiency of the machine learning pipeline to make informed decisions on data readiness for AI applications.</description>

      <title>A Practical Review of Mechanistic Interpretability for Transformer-Based Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator for Fake News Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In current web environment, fake news spreads rapidly across online social networks, posing serious threats to society. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods can generally be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are heavily rely on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models.

      <title>Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple LLM-empowered agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries. These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.

      <title>A Unified Framework for Motion Reasoning and Generation in Human Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural and contextually relevant text, enabling more human-like AI interactions. However, generating and understanding interactive human-like motion, where multiple individuals engage in coordinated movements, remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling these interactions. Additionally, a unified and versatile model is needed to handle diverse interactive scenarios, such as chat systems that dynamically adapt to user instructions and assigned roles. To address these challenges, we introduce VIM, the Versatile Interactive Motion-language model, which integrates both language and motion modalities to effectively understand, generate, and control interactive motions in multi-turn conversational contexts. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on uni-directional tasks such as text-to-motion or motion-to-text, VIM employs a unified architecture capable of simultaneously understanding and generating both motion and text modalities. Given the absence of an appropriate dataset to support this task, we introduce Inter-MT2, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset containing 82.7K multi-turn interactive motion instructions, covering 153K interactive motion samples. Inter-MT2 spans diverse instructional scenarios, including motion editing, question answering, and story generation, leveraging off-the-shelf large language models and motion diffusion models to construct a broad set of interactive motion instructions. We extensively evaluate the versatility of VIM across multiple interactive motion-related tasks, including motion-to-text, text-to-motion, reaction generation, motion editing, and reasoning about motion sequences.</description>

      <title>Exponential Speedups by Rerooting Levin Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levin Tree Search (LTS) (Orseau et al., 2018) is a search algorithm for deterministic environments that uses a user-specified policy to guide the search. It comes with a formal guarantee on the number of search steps (node visits) for finding a solution node that depends on the quality of the policy. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, called $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ (pronounce root-LTS), which implicitly starts an LTS search rooted at every node of the search tree. Each LTS search is assigned a rerooting weight by a (user-defined or learnt) rerooter, and the search effort is shared between all LTS searches proportionally to their weights. The rerooting mechanism implicitly decomposes the search space into subtasks, leading to significant speedups. We prove that the number of node visits that $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ takes is competitive with the best decomposition into subtasks, at the price of a factor that relates to the uncertainty of the rerooter. If LTS takes time $T$, in the best case with $q$ rerooting points, $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ only takes time $O(q\sqrt[q]{T})$. Like the policy, the rerooter can be learnt from data, and we expect $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ to be applicable to a wide range of domains.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan with Personalized Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective integration of AI agents into daily life requires them to understand and adapt to individual human preferences, particularly in collaborative roles. Although recent studies on embodied intelligence have advanced significantly, they typically adopt generalized approaches that overlook personal preferences in planning. We address this limitation by developing agents that not only learn preferences from few demonstrations but also learn to adapt their planning strategies based on these preferences. Our research leverages the observation that preferences, though implicitly expressed through minimal demonstrations, can generalize across diverse planning scenarios. To systematically evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce Preference-based Planning (PbP) benchmark, an embodied benchmark featuring hundreds of diverse preferences spanning from atomic actions to complex sequences. Our evaluation of SOTA methods reveals that while symbol-based approaches show promise in scalability, significant challenges remain in learning to generate and execute plans that satisfy personalized preferences. We further demonstrate that incorporating learned preferences as intermediate representations in planning significantly improves the agent's ability to construct personalized plans. These findings establish preferences as a valuable abstraction layer for adaptive planning, opening new directions for research in preference-guided plan generation and execution.</description>

      <title>Optimus-2: Multimodal Minecraft Agent with Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building an agent that can mimic human behavior patterns to accomplish various open-world tasks is a long-term goal. To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.

      <title>Building Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Function: A Deck of Cards based Co-constructive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its inception, Fuzzy Set has been widely used to handle uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making. However, conventional fuzzy sets, often referred to as type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) have limitations in capturing higher levels of uncertainty, particularly when decision-makers (DMs) express hesitation or ambiguity in membership degree. To address this, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) have been introduced by incorporating uncertainty in membership degree allocation, which enhanced flexibility in modelling subjective judgments. Despite their advantages, existing IT2FS construction methods often lack active involvement from DMs and that limits the interpretability and effectiveness of decision models. This study proposes a socio-technical co-constructive approach for developing IT2FS models of linguistic terms by facilitating the active involvement of DMs in preference elicitation and its application in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Our methodology is structured in two phases. The first phase involves an interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a modified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS membership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to incorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS model that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The second phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by defining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information, aggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle. The proposed framework enhances the reliability and effectiveness of fuzzy decision-making not only by accurately representing DM's personalized semantics of linguistic information.</description>

      <title>ToolFuzz -- Automated Agent Tool Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.</description>

Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarr\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.</description>

      <title>SketchOGD: Memory-Efficient Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When machine learning models are trained continually on a sequence of tasks, they are often liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks--a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation tasks proliferates, concerns arise over their potential to compromise academic integrity. The education sector currently tussles with distinguishing student-authored homework assignments from AI-generated ones. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing HowkGPT, designed to identify homework assignments generated by AI. HowkGPT is built upon a dataset of academic assignments and accompanying metadata [17] and employs a pretrained LLM to compute perplexity scores for student-authored and ChatGPT-generated responses. These scores then assist in establishing a threshold for discerning the origin of a submitted assignment. Given the specificity and contextual nature of academic work, HowkGPT further refines its analysis by defining category-specific thresholds derived from the metadata, enhancing the precision of the detection. This study emphasizes the critical need for effective strategies to uphold academic integrity amidst the growing influence of LLMs and provides an approach to ensuring fair and accurate grading in educational institutions.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Structure Inference From Data Under Smoothness Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing hypergraph structure inference methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage self-supervised vision transformer models and their emergent semantic abilities to improve the generalization abilities of imitation learning policies. We introduce DVK, an imitation learning algorithm that leverages rich pre-trained Visual Transformer patch-level embeddings to obtain better generalization when learning through demonstrations. Our learner sees the world by clustering appearance features into groups associated with semantic concepts, forming stable keypoints that generalize across a wide range of appearance variations and object types. We demonstrate how this representation enables generalized behaviour by evaluating imitation learning across a diverse dataset of object manipulation tasks. To facilitate further study of generalization in Imitation Learning, all of our code for the method and evaluation, as well as the dataset, is made available.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a novel framework that integrates tensor-based operations into the attention mechanism, thereby enhancing both the expressivity and computational efficiency of deep neural networks. Our approach leverages the algebraic structure of tensor products to generalize the conventional dot-product attention and to formulate new operators, namely, Tensor Attention and Tensor Interaction, which capture higher-order token dependencies. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on the universal properties of tensor products, we demonstrate that our framework not only improves efficiency by reducing computational complexity but also offers a principled method for modeling complex interactions in sequential data. Empirical evaluations further substantiate that the proposed deep tensor network can serve as a robust building block for advancing state-of-the-art performance in various deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Texts for Latent Diffusion Inverse Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of diffusion models has led to significant progress in solving inverse problems by leveraging these models as powerful generative priors. However, challenges persist due to the ill-posed nature of such problems, often arising from ambiguities in measurements or intrinsic system symmetries. To address this, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver, regularization by text (TReg), inspired by the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases. TReg integrates textual descriptions of preconceptions about the solution during reverse diffusion sampling, dynamically reinforcing these descriptions through null-text optimization, which we refer to as adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg effectively mitigates ambiguity in inverse problems, improving both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>The VampPrior Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used deep latent variable models (DLVMs), in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), employ overly simplistic priors on the latent space. To achieve strong clustering performance, existing methods that replace the standard normal prior with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) require defining the number of clusters to be close to the number of expected ground truth classes a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. We leverage VampPrior concepts (Tomczak and Welling, 2018) to fit a Bayesian GMM prior, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. In a VAE, the VMM attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Integrating the VMM into scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into clusters with similar biological characteristics.</description>

      <title>M-HOF-Opt: Multi-Objective Hierarchical Output Feedback Optimization via Multiplier Induced Loss Landscape Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic graphical model is proposed, modeling the joint model parameter and multiplier evolution, with a hypervolume based likelihood, promoting multi-objective descent in structural risk minimization. We address multi-objective model parameter optimization via a surrogate single objective penalty loss with time-varying multipliers, equivalent to online scheduling of loss landscape. The multi-objective descent goal is dispatched hierarchically into a series of constraint optimization sub-problems with shrinking bounds according to Pareto dominance. The bound serves as setpoint for the low-level multiplier controller to schedule loss landscapes via output feedback of each loss term. Our method forms closed loop of model parameter dynamic, circumvents excessive memory requirements and extra computational burden of existing multi-objective deep learning methods, and is robust against controller hyperparameter variation, demonstrated on domain generalization tasks with multi-dimensional regularization losses.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Guided Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based adversarial purification (AP) has proven to be a powerful defense method that can remove adversarial perturbations and generate a purified example without threats. In principle, the pre-trained DMs can only ensure that purified examples conform to the same distribution of the training data, but it may inadvertently compromise the semantic information of input examples, leading to misclassification of purified examples. Recent advancements introduce guided diffusion techniques to preserve semantic information while removing the perturbations. However, these guidances often rely on distance measures between purified examples and diffused examples, which can also preserve perturbations in purified examples. To further unleash the robustness power of DM-based AP, we propose an adversarial guided diffusion model (AGDM) by introducing a novel adversarial guidance that contains sufficient semantic information but does not explicitly involve adversarial perturbations. The guidance is modeled by an auxiliary neural network obtained with adversarial training, considering the distance in the latent representations rather than at the pixel-level values. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method is effective for simultaneously maintaining semantic information and removing the adversarial perturbations. In addition, comprehensive comparisons show that our method significantly enhances the robustness of existing DM-based AP, with an average robust accuracy improved by up to 7.30% on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>RealmDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Scene Generation with Inpainting and Depth Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generating forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

      <title>Is the House Ready For Sleeptime? Generating and Evaluating Situational Queries for Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and tackle the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) with Situational Queries (S-EQA) in a household environment. Unlike prior EQA work tackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and properties ("What is the color of the car?"), situational queries (such as "Is the house ready for sleeptime?") are challenging as they require the agent to correctly identify multiple object-states (Doors: Closed, Lights: Off, etc.) and reach a consensus on their states for an answer. Towards this objective, we first introduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an LLM's output to generate unique situational queries and corresponding consensus object information. PGE is used to generate 2K datapoints in the VirtualHome simulator, which is then annotated for ground truth answers via a large scale user-study conducted on M-Turk. With a high rate of answerability (97.26%) on this study, we establish that LLMs are good at generating situational data. However, in evaluating the data using an LLM, we observe a low correlation of 46.2% with the ground truth human annotations; indicating that while LLMs are good at generating situational data, they struggle to answer them according to consensus. When asked for reasoning, we observe the LLM often goes against commonsense in justifying its answer. Finally, we utilize PGE to generate situational data in a real-world environment, exposing LLM hallucination in generating reliable object-states when a structured scene graph is unavailable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA in the context of situational queries and also the first to present a generative approach for query creation. We aim to foster research on improving the real-world usability of embodied agents through this work.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/Curriculum-DPO.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Programmatic Reinforcement Learning Policies with Large Language Model Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmatic reinforcement learning (PRL) has been explored for representing policies through programs as a means to achieve interpretability and generalization. Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs consistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS framework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks, showing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of the domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain performant programs.</description>

      <title>Value Improved Actor Critic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To learn approximately optimal acting policies for decision problems, modern Actor Critic algorithms rely on deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to parameterize the acting policy and greedification operators to iteratively improve it. The reliance on DNNs suggests an improvement that is gradient based, which is per step much less greedy than the improvement possible by greedier operators such as the greedy update used by Q-learning algorithms. On the other hand, slow and steady changes to the policy can also be beneficial for the stability of the learning process, resulting in a tradeoff between greedification and stability. To address this tradeoff, we propose to extend the standard framework of actor critic algorithms with value-improvement: a second greedification operator applied only when updating the policy's value estimate. In this framework the agent can evaluate non-parameterized policies and perform much greedier updates while maintaining the steady gradient-based improvement to the parameterized acting policy. We prove that this approach converges in the popular analysis scheme of Generalized Policy Iteration in the finite-horizon domain. Empirically, incorporating value-improvement into the popular off-policy actor-critic algorithms TD3 and SAC significantly improves or matches performance over their respective baselines, across different environments from the DeepMind continuous control domain, with negligible compute and implementation cost.</description>

      <title>How Data Inter-connectivity Shapes LLMs Unlearning: A Structural Unlearning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While unlearning knowledge from large language models (LLMs) is receiving increasing attention, one important aspect remains unexplored. Existing approaches and benchmarks assume data points to-be-forgotten are independent, ignoring their inter-connectivity - a fundamental characteristic of real-world data structures. In this paper, we propose PISTOL, a method for compiling structural datasets. PISTOL leverages the inherently structured nature of contractual relationships, offering several key benefits. First, it enables insights into the impact of structural data on unlearning effectiveness. Second, it provides precise and concise ground truths for clearer evaluation. Third, its attribute generation does not require input from pre-trained LLMs, mitigating confounding risks. Leveraging datasets synthesized using PISTOL, we demonstrate how data inter-connectivity impacts LLM unlearning. Specifically, (a) in both the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, unlearning difficulty increases as data inter-connectivity grows, (b) there is a positive correlation between the density of the knowledge graph and unlearning difficulty, and (c) when the to-be-forgotten data is skewed towards one domain, balancing retaining performance across all domains is challenging.</description>

      <title>Detect, Investigate, Judge and Determine: A Knowledge-guided Framework for Few-shot Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Fake News Detection (FS-FND) aims to distinguish inaccurate news from real ones in extremely low-resource scenarios. This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Knowledge-guided Fake News Detection (DKFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DKFND first identifies the knowledge concepts of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DKFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to evaluate the relevance and confidence of them. Finally, a Determination Module further derives two respective predictions and obtain the final result. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Selective Debiasing to Enhance Fairness in Text Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism designed to enhance the overall model quality in terms of prediction performance and fairness, especially in scenarios where retraining the model is impractical. The method draws inspiration from selective classification, where at inference time, predictions with low quality, as indicated by their uncertainty scores, are discarded. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we remove bias from these predictions using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard uncertainty quantification methods. Experiments on text classification datasets with encoder-based classification models demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to reduce the performance gap between post-processing methods and debiasing techniques from the at-training and pre-processing categories.</description>

      <title>Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</description>

      <title>Training with Differential Privacy: A Gradient-Preserving Noise Reduction Approach with Provable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been extensively adopted in various regions due to their ability to represent hierarchical features, which highly rely on the training set and procedures. Thus, protecting the training process and deep learning algorithms is paramount in privacy preservation. Although Differential Privacy (DP) as a powerful cryptographic primitive has achieved satisfying results in deep learning training, the existing schemes still fall short in preserving model utility, i.e., they either invoke a high noise scale or inevitably harm the original gradients. To address the above issues, in this paper, we present a more robust and provably secure approach for differentially private training called GReDP. Specifically, we compute the model gradients in the frequency domain and adopt a new approach to reduce the noise level. Unlike previous work, our GReDP only requires half of the noise scale compared to DPSGD [1] while keeping all the gradient information intact. We present a detailed analysis of our method both theoretically and empirically. The experimental results show that our GReDP works consistently better than the baselines on all models and training settings.</description>

      <title>LEMMo-Plan: LLM-Enhanced Learning from Multi-Modal Demonstration for Planning Sequential Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in task planning for long-horizon manipulation tasks. To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots. In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance LLMs' ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations. Real-world experiments on two different sequential manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving LLMs' understanding of multi-modal demonstrations and enhancing the overall planning performance.</description>

      <title>Meta-RTL: Reinforcement-Based Meta-Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>What Information Contributes to Log-based Anomaly Detection? Insights from a Configurable Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems. State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear. In addition, most existing approaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide fine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a configurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection. The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths. The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aware Embedding Fusion in LLMs (Flan-T5, LLAMA 2, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT 4) for Intelligent Response Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathetic and coherent responses are critical in auto-mated chatbot-facilitated psychotherapy. This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the emotional and contextual understanding of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatric applications. We introduce Emotion-Aware Embedding Fusion, a novel framework integrating hierarchical fusion and attention mechanisms to prioritize semantic and emotional features in therapy transcripts. Our approach combines multiple emotion lexicons, including NRC Emotion Lexicon, VADER, WordNet, and SentiWordNet, with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Flan-T5, LLAMA 2, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT 4. Therapy session transcripts, comprising over 2,000 samples are segmented into hierarchical levels (word, sentence, and session) using neural networks, while hierarchical fusion combines these features with pooling techniques to refine emotional representations. Atten-tion mechanisms, including multi-head self-attention and cross-attention, further prioritize emotional and contextual features, enabling temporal modeling of emotion-al shifts across sessions. The processed embeddings, computed using BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa are stored in the Facebook AI similarity search vector database, which enables efficient similarity search and clustering across dense vector spaces. Upon user queries, relevant segments are retrieved and provided as context to LLMs, enhancing their ability to generate empathetic and con-textually relevant responses. The proposed framework is evaluated across multiple practical use cases to demonstrate real-world applicability, including AI-driven therapy chatbots. The system can be integrated into existing mental health platforms to generate personalized responses based on retrieved therapy session data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines. However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research. CAX delivers cutting-edge performance through hardware acceleration while maintaining flexibility through its modular architecture, intuitive API, and support for both discrete and continuous cellular automata in arbitrary dimensions. We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture. Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</description>

      <title>6DGS: Enhanced Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

      <title>Taylor Unswift: Secured Weight Release for Large Language Models via Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</description>

      <title>LLM-HDR: Bridging LLM-based Perception and Self-Supervision for Unpaired LDR-to-HDR Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</description>

      <title>V-LoRA: An Efficient and Flexible System Boosts Vision Applications with LoRA LMM</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown significant progress in various complex vision tasks with the solid linguistic and reasoning capacity inherited from large language models (LMMs). Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a promising method to integrate external knowledge into LMMs, compensating for their limitations on domain-specific tasks. However, the existing LoRA model serving is excessively computationally expensive and causes extremely high latency. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that empowers diverse vision tasks and enriches vision applications with LoRA LMMs. Our system, VaLoRA, enables accurate and efficient vision tasks by 1) an accuracy-aware LoRA adapter generation approach that generates LoRA adapters rich in domain-specific knowledge to meet application-specific accuracy requirements, 2) an adaptive-tiling LoRA adapters batching operator that efficiently computes concurrent heterogeneous LoRA adapters, and 3) a flexible LoRA adapter orchestration mechanism that manages application requests and LoRA adapters to achieve the lowest average response latency. We prototype VaLoRA on five popular vision tasks on three LMMs. Experiment results reveal that VaLoRA improves 24-62% of the accuracy compared to the original LMMs and reduces 20-89% of the latency compared to the state-of-the-art LoRA model serving systems.</description>

      <title>AtlasSeg: Atlas Prior Guided Dual-U-Net for Cortical Segmentation in Fetal Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate automatic tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI is a crucial step in clinical diagnosis but remains challenging, particularly due to the dynamically changing anatomy and tissue contrast during fetal development. Existing segmentation networks can only implicitly learn age-related features, leading to a decline in accuracy at extreme early or late gestational ages (GAs). To improve segmentation performance throughout gestation, we introduce AtlasSeg, a dual-U-shape convolution network that explicitly integrates GA-specific information as guidance. By providing a publicly available fetal brain atlas with segmentation labels corresponding to relevant GAs, AtlasSeg effectively extracts age-specific patterns in the atlas branch and generates precise tissue segmentation in the segmentation branch. Multi-scale spatial attention feature fusions are constructed during both encoding and decoding stages to enhance feature flow and facilitate better information interactions between two branches. We compared AtlasSeg with six well-established networks in a seven-tissue segmentation task, achieving the highest average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91. The improvement was particularly evident in extreme early or late GA cases, where training data was scare. Furthermore, AtlasSeg exhibited minimal performance degradation on low-quality images with contrast changes and noise, attributed to its anatomical shape priors. Overall, AtlasSeg demonstrated enhanced segmentation accuracy, better consistency across fetal ages, and robustness to perturbations, making it a powerful tool for reliable fetal brain MRI tissue segmentation, particularly suited for diagnostic assessments during early gestation.</description>

      <title>Fair Summarization: Bridging Quality and Diversity in Extractive Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization of user-generated content remains a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods often fail to ensure equitable representation across different social groups, leading to biased outputs. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods for fair extractive summarization: FairExtract, a clustering-based approach, and FairGPT, which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints. We evaluate these methods using Divsumm summarization dataset of White-aligned, Hispanic, and African-American dialect tweets and compare them against relevant baselines. The results obtained using a comprehensive set of summarization quality metrics such as SUPERT, BLANC, SummaQA, BARTScore, and UniEval, as well as a fairness metric F, demonstrate that FairExtract and FairGPT achieve superior fairness while maintaining competitive summarization quality. Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework, offering a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between these objectives. Our code is available online.</description>

      <title>PyGen: A Collaborative Human-AI Approach to Python Package Creation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

      <title>MTA: Multimodal Task Alignment for BEV Perception and Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</description>

      <title>OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15098v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OminiControl, a novel approach that rethinks how image conditions are integrated into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures. Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</description>

      <title>KinMo: Kinematic-aware Human Motion Understanding and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as ``run", fails to capture details like variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{KinMo}, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global action by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment, improving spatial understanding by integrating additional motion details. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

      <title>Proto Successor Measure: Representing the Behavior Space of an RL Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having explored an environment, intelligent agents should be able to transfer their knowledge to most downstream tasks within that environment without additional interactions. Referred to as "zero-shot learning", this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present Proto Successor Measure: the basis set for all possible behaviors of a Reinforcement Learning Agent in a dynamical system. We prove that any possible behavior (represented using visitation distributions) can be represented using an affine combination of these policy-independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these bases corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using reward-free interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

      <title>RL-MILP Solver: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programs with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a widely used optimization technique across various fields. Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>LayoutVLM: Differentiable Optimization of 3D Layout via Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, enabling intuitive understanding and manipulation of objects in three-dimensional space. While foundation models demonstrate remarkable performance on some benchmarks, they still struggle with 3D reasoning tasks like arranging objects in space according to open-ended language instructions, particularly in dense and physically constrained environments. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve their reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation in Context through Collaborative LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</description>

      <title>DMin: Scalable Training Data Influence Estimation for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models (DMs), yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</description>

      <title>SweetTok: Semantic-Aware Spatial-Temporal Tokenizer for Compact Video Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the \textbf{S}emantic-a\textbf{W}ar\textbf{E} spatial-t\textbf{E}mporal \textbf{T}okenizer (SweetTok), a novel video tokenizer to overcome the limitations in current video tokenization methods for compacted yet effective discretization. Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Faster Vision Mamba is Rebuilt in Minutes via Merged Token Re-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Mamba has shown close to state of the art performance on computer vision tasks, drawing much interest in increasing it's efficiency. A promising approach is token reduction (that has been successfully implemented in ViTs). Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and degraded performance. An alternative, of merging tokens preserves more information than pruning, also suffers for large compression ratios. Our key insight is that a quick round of retraining after token merging yeilds robust results across various compression ratios. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drops 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</description>

      <title>Multi-P$^2$A: A Multi-perspective Benchmark on Privacy Assessment for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive potential across various tasks but also face significant privacy risks, limiting their practical applications. Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-P$^2$A covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-P$^2$A, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.</description>

      <title>TexAVi: Generating Stereoscopic VR Video Clips from Text Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.
  Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.
  We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.
  Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</description>

      <title>KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</description>

      <title>MambaQuant: Quantizing the Mamba Family with Variance Aligned Rotation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MambaQuant is the first comprehensive PTQ design for the Mamba family, paving the way for further advancements in its application.</description>

      <title>Data Duplication: A Novel Multi-Purpose Attack Paradigm in Machine Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Duplication is a prevalent issue within datasets. Existing research has demonstrated that the presence of duplicated data in training datasets can significantly influence both model performance and data privacy. However, the impact of data duplication on the unlearning process remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by pioneering a comprehensive investigation into the role of data duplication, not only in standard machine unlearning but also in federated and reinforcement unlearning paradigms. Specifically, we propose an adversary who duplicates a subset of the target model's training set and incorporates it into the training set. After training, the adversary requests the model owner to unlearn this duplicated subset, and analyzes the impact on the unlearned model. For example, the adversary can challenge the model owner by revealing that, despite efforts to unlearn it, the influence of the duplicated subset remains in the model. Moreover, to circumvent detection by de-duplication techniques, we propose three novel near-duplication methods for the adversary, each tailored to a specific unlearning paradigm. We then examine their impacts on the unlearning process when de-duplication techniques are applied. Our findings reveal several crucial insights: 1) the gold standard unlearning method, retraining from scratch, fails to effectively conduct unlearning under certain conditions; 2) unlearning duplicated data can lead to significant model degradation in specific scenarios; and 3) meticulously crafted duplicates can evade detection by de-duplication methods.</description>

      <title>Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</description>

      <title>Reflection-Window Decoding: Text Generation with Selective Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Rationalization Models for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</description>

      <title>ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing more explainable reasoning structures than DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

      <title>Automated Consistency Analysis of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (Gen AI) with large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across the industry, academia and government. Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>IRepair: An Intent-Aware Approach to Repair Data-Driven Errors in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not a day goes by without hearing about the impressive feats of large language models (LLMs), and equally, not a day passes without hearing about their challenges. LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset, leading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been employed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model parameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair quality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach selectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair. Specifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers that require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas. This method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the model's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We evaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families, with parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our results show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing 46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline, direct preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors are more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of layers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\%. This highlights the need for selective repair. Additionally, we demonstrate that a dynamic selection approach is essential for addressing errors dispersed throughout the model, ensuring a robust and efficient repair.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Masked Position Prediction for Efficient Molecular Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown considerable promise in computational chemistry. However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</description>

      <title>Reasoning-Augmented Conversation for Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks simulate real-world human interactions by engaging large language models (LLMs) in iterative dialogues, exposing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</description>

      <title>IMLE Policy: Fast and Sample Efficient Visuomotor Policy Learning via Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning, particularly using generative modelling techniques like diffusion, have enabled policies to capture complex multi-modal action distributions. However, these methods often require large datasets and multiple inference steps for action generation, posing challenges in robotics where the cost for data collection is high and computation resources are limited. To address this, we introduce IMLE Policy, a novel behaviour cloning approach based on Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). IMLE Policy excels in low-data regimes, effectively learning from minimal demonstrations and requiring 38\% less data on average to match the performance of baseline methods in learning complex multi-modal behaviours. Its simple generator-based architecture enables single-step action generation, improving inference speed by 97.3\% compared to Diffusion Policy, while outperforming single-step Flow Matching. We validate our approach across diverse manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments, showcasing its ability to capture complex behaviours under data constraints. Videos and code are provided on our project page: https://imle-policy.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Helix-mRNA: A Hybrid Foundation Model For Full Sequence mRNA Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: mRNA-based vaccines have become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry. The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model (https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights (https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).</description>

      <title>FR-Spec: Accelerating Large-Vocabulary Language Models via Frequency-Ranked Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.

      <title>Q-PETR: Quant-aware Position Embedding Transformation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection has emerged as an attractive solution for autonomous driving due to its low cost and broad applicability. However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Forgotten Polygons: Multimodal Large Language Models are Shape-Blind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

      <title>PaCA: Partial Connection Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms reduce memory usage and computational costs of fine-tuning large neural network models by training only a few additional adapter parameters, rather than the entire model. However, the reduction in computational costs due to PEFT does not necessarily translate to a reduction in training time; although the computational costs of the adapter layers are much smaller than the pretrained layers, it is well known that those two types of layers are processed sequentially on GPUs, resulting in significant latency overhead. LoRA and its variants merge low-rank adapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency overhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the adapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate this issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes randomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of introducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed by eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the adapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only partial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for gradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and total memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various fine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction tuning on the Oasst1 dataset. PaCA can also be combined with quantization, enabling the fine-tuning of large models such as LLaMA3.1-70B. In addition, PaCA enables training with 23% longer sequence and improves throughput by 16% on both NVIDIA A100 GPU and INTEL Gaudi2 HPU compared to LoRA.

      <title>IterPref: Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from
  candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</description>

      <title>(How) Do Language Models Track State?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</description>

      <title>KunlunBaize: LLM with Multi-Scale Convolution and Multi-Token Prediction Under TransformerX Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they face challenges such as low computational efficiency, gradient vanishing, and difficulties in capturing complex feature interactions. To address these limitations, a novel framework has been proposed. This framework incorporates a learnable dense residual skip connection mechanism, a TransformerX module a transformer based component integrating multiscale convolution and adaptive activation functions and a multitoken prediction interaction module. The learnable dense residual connections enhance information flow and feature capture across layers. Within the TransformerX module, large convolutional kernels aggregate semantic information from extensive text segments, while smaller convolutions focus on local word order and syntactic structures. The adaptive activation function dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the semantic features of the input text, improving the model's ability to handle diverse semantic expressions and complex relationships. The multitoken prediction module boosts data utilization and accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens. These components significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models.</description>

      <title>Call for Rigor in Reporting Quality of Instruction Tuning Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for adapting large language models (LLMs) to align with user intentions. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frozen Region Growth in Kidney Cryoablation Intervention Using a 3D Flow-Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a 3D flow-matching model designed to predict the progression of the frozen region (iceball) during kidney cryoablation. Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.</description>

      <title>Balcony: A Lightweight Approach to Dynamic Inference of Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is often hindered by strict computational and latency constraints. While dynamic inference offers the flexibility to adjust model behavior based on varying resource budgets, existing methods are frequently limited by hardware inefficiencies or performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Balcony, a simple yet highly effective framework for depth-based dynamic inference. By freezing the pretrained LLM and inserting additional transformer layers at selected exit points, Balcony maintains the full model's performance while enabling real-time adaptation to different computational budgets. These additional layers are trained using a straightforward self-distillation loss, aligning the sub-model outputs with those of the full model. This approach requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters, drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining data, Balcony achieves minimal performance degradation while enabling significant speedups. Remarkably, we show that Balcony outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Flextron and Layerskip as well as other leading compression techniques on multiple models and at various scales, across a variety of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Enables Parameter Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</description>

      <title>VideoPainter: Any-length Video Inpainting and Editing with Plug-and-Play Context Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video inpainting, which aims to restore corrupted video content, has experienced substantial progress. Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</description>

      <title>The Lazy Student's Dream: ChatGPT Passing an Engineering Course on Its Own</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to successfully complete a semester-long undergraduate control systems course. Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a "minimal effort" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education. Additional materials including syllabus, examination papers, design projects, and example responses can be found at the project website: https://gradegpt.github.io.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Reaction Products from Generic Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</description>

      <title>LightMotion: A Light and Tuning-free Method for Simulating Camera Motion in Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description>

      <title>Interactive Medical Image Analysis with Concept-based Similarity Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.</description>

      <title>FaceID-6M: A Large-Scale, Open-Source FaceID Customization Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the data-driven nature of current face identity (FaceID) customization methods, all state-of-the-art models rely on large-scale datasets containing millions of high-quality text-image pairs for training. However, none of these datasets are publicly available, which restricts transparency and hinders further advancements in the field.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we collect and release FaceID-6M, the first large-scale, open-source FaceID dataset containing 6 million high-quality text-image pairs. Filtered from LAION-5B \cite{schuhmann2022laion}, FaceID-6M undergoes a rigorous image and text filtering steps to ensure dataset quality, including resolution filtering to maintain high-quality images and faces, face filtering to remove images that lack human faces, and keyword-based strategy to retain descriptions containing human-related terms (e.g., nationality, professions and names). Through these cleaning processes, FaceID-6M provides a high-quality dataset optimized for training powerful FaceID customization models, facilitating advancements in the field by offering an open resource for research and development.
  We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our FaceID-6M, demonstrating that models trained on our FaceID-6M dataset achieve performance that is comparable to, and slightly better than currently available industrial models. Additionally, to support and advance research in the FaceID customization community, we make our code, datasets, and models fully publicly available. Our codes, models, and datasets are available at: https://github.com/ShuheSH/FaceID-6M.</description>

      <title>Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>LMM-R1: Empowering 3B LMMs with Strong Reasoning Abilities Through Two-Stage Rule-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning, particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.
  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.
  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</description>

      <title>Inductive Moment Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</description>
