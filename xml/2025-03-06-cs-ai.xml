      <title>Neural Manifolds and Cognitive Consistency: A New Approach to Memory Consolidation in Artificial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mathematical framework that unifies neural population dynamics, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SpWR) generation, and cognitive consistency constraints inspired by Heider's theory. Our model leverages low-dimensional manifold representations to capture structured neural drift and incorporates a balance energy function to enforce coherent synaptic interactions, effectively simulating the memory consolidation processes observed in biological systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach not only reproduces key features of SpWR events but also enhances network interpretability. This work paves the way for scalable neuromorphic architectures that bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering more robust and adaptive learning mechanisms for future intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Embeddings as a Behavior Specification Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to formally specifying the behavioral properties of systems that rely on a perception model for interactions with the physical world. The key idea is to introduce embeddings -- mathematical representations of a real-world concept -- as a first-class construct in a specification language, where properties are expressed in terms of distances between a pair of ideal and observed embeddings. To realize this approach, we propose a new type of temporal logic called Embedding Temporal Logic (ETL), and describe how it can be used to express a wider range of properties about AI-enabled systems than previously possible. We demonstrate the applicability of ETL through a preliminary evaluation involving planning tasks in robots that are driven by foundation models; the results are promising, showing that embedding-based specifications can be used to steer a system towards desirable behaviors.</description>

      <title>EPEE: Towards Efficient and Effective Foundation Models in Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, including language models, e.g., GPT, and vision models, e.g., CLIP, have significantly advanced numerous biomedical tasks. Despite these advancements, the high inference latency and the "overthinking" issues in model inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models, thus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address these challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of foundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based and patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective weaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical tasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets, including clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE significantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed critical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It potentially provided a practical solution for real-time clinical decision-making with foundation models, supporting reliable and efficient workflows.</description>

      <title>TMIQ: Quantifying Test and Measurement Domain Intelligence in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Test and Measurement domain, known for its strict requirements for accuracy and efficiency, is increasingly adopting Generative AI technologies to enhance the performance of data analysis, automation, and decision-making processes. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise for advancing automation and precision in testing. However, the evaluation of LLMs in this specialized area remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the Test and Measurement Intelligence Quotient (TMIQ), a benchmark designed to quantitatively assess LLMs across a wide range of electronic engineering tasks. TMIQ offers a comprehensive set of scenarios and metrics for detailed evaluation, including SCPI command matching accuracy, ranked response evaluation, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT), and the impact of output formatting variations required by LLMs on performance. In testing various LLMs, our findings indicate varying levels of proficiency, with exact SCPI command match accuracy ranging from around 56% to 73%, and ranked matching first-position scores achieving around 33% for the best-performing model. We also assess token usage, cost-efficiency, and response times, identifying trade-offs between accuracy and operational efficiency. Additionally, we present a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate datasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs. TMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs for production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying strengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections for applications within the Test and Measurement industry.</description>

      <title>KGCompiler: Deep Learning Compilation Optimization for Knowledge Graph Complex Logical Query Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Logical Query Answering (CLQA) involves intricate multi-hop logical reasoning over large-scale and potentially incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Although existing CLQA algorithms achieve high accuracy in answering such queries, their reasoning time and memory usage scale significantly with the number of First-Order Logic (FOL) operators involved, creating serious challenges for practical deployment. In addition, current research primarily focuses on algorithm-level optimizations for CLQA tasks, often overlooking compiler-level optimizations, which can offer greater generality and scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a Knowledge Graph Compiler, namely KGCompiler, the first deep learning compiler specifically designed for CLQA tasks. By incorporating KG-specific optimizations proposed in this paper, KGCompiler enhances the reasoning performance of CLQA algorithms without requiring additional manual modifications to their implementations. At the same time, it significantly reduces memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KGCompiler accelerates CLQA algorithms by factors ranging from 1.04x to 8.26x, with an average speedup of 3.71x. We also provide an interface to enable hands-on experience with KGCompiler.</description>

      <title>Attention Bootstrapping for Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt a well-trained model to potential distribution shifts at test time using only unlabeled test data, without access to the original training data. While previous efforts mainly focus on a single modality, test-time distribution shift in the multi-modal setting is more complex and calls for new solutions. This paper tackles the problem of multi-modal test-time adaptation by proposing a novel method named Attention Bootstrapping with Principal Entropy Minimization (ABPEM). We observe that test-time distribution shift causes misalignment across modalities, leading to a large gap between intra-modality discrepancies (measured by self-attention) and inter-modality discrepancies (measured by cross-attention). We name this the attention gap. This attention gap widens with more severe distribution shifts, hindering effective modality fusion. To mitigate this attention gap and encourage better modality fusion, we propose attention bootstrapping that promotes cross-attention with the guidance of self-attention. Moreover, to reduce the gradient noise in the commonly-used entropy minimization, we adopt principal entropy minimization, a refinement of entropy minimization that reduces gradient noise by focusing on the principal parts of entropy, excluding less reliable gradient information. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed ABPEM in comparison with competing baselines.</description>

      <title>V2X-LLM: Enhancing V2X Integration and Understanding in Connected Vehicle Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) offers significant potential for enhancing transportation safety, mobility, and sustainability. However, the integration and analysis of the diverse and voluminous V2X data, including Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) and Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data, present substantial challenges, especially on Connected Vehicle Corridors. These challenges include managing large data volumes, ensuring real-time data integration, and understanding complex traffic scenarios. Although these projects have developed an advanced CAV data pipeline that enables real-time communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users for managing connected vehicle and roadside unit (RSU) data, significant hurdles in data comprehension and real-time scenario analysis and reasoning persist. To address these issues, we introduce the V2X-LLM framework, a novel enhancement to the existing CV data pipeline. V2X-LLM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the understanding and real-time analysis of V2X data. The framework includes four key tasks: Scenario Explanation, offering detailed narratives of traffic conditions; V2X Data Description, detailing vehicle and infrastructure statuses; State Prediction, forecasting future traffic states; and Navigation Advisory, providing optimized routing instructions. By integrating LLM-driven reasoning with V2X data within the data pipeline, the V2X-LLM framework offers real-time feedback and decision support for traffic management. This integration enhances the accuracy of traffic analysis, safety, and traffic optimization. Demonstrations in a real-world urban corridor highlight the framework's potential to advance intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>AppAgentX: Evolving GUI Agents as Proficient Smartphone Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</description>

      <title>Memorize or Generalize? Evaluating LLM Code Generation with Evolved Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit a memorization phenomenon in code generation: instead of truly understanding the underlying principles of a programming problem, they tend to memorize the original prompt and its solution together in the training. Consequently, when facing variants of the original problem, their answers very likely resemble the memorized solutions and fail to generalize. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by designing three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation, paraphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST similarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions, we develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of memorization. As expected, as supervised fine-tuning goes on, the memorization score rises before overfitting, suggesting more severe memorization. We demonstrate that common mitigation approaches, such as prompt translation and using evolved variants as data augmentation in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, either compromise the performance or fail to alleviate the memorization issue. Therefore, memorization remains a significant challenge in LLM code generation, highlighting the need for a more effective solution.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Product Quality of the Injection Process Using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injection molding process is a traditional technique for making products in various industries such as electronics and automobiles via solidifying liquid resin into certain molds. Although the process is not related to creating the main part of engines or semiconductors, this manufacturing methodology sets the final form of the products. Re-cently, research has continued to reduce the defect rate of the injection molding process. This study proposes an optimal injection molding process control system to reduce the defect rate of injection molding products with XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) ap-proaches. Boosting algorithms (XGBoost and LightGBM) are used as tree-based classifiers for predicting whether each product is normal or defective. The main features to control the process for improving the product are extracted by SHapley Additive exPlanations, while the individual conditional expectation analyzes the optimal control range of these extracted features. To validate the methodology presented in this work, the actual injection molding AI manufacturing dataset provided by KAMP (Korea AI Manufacturing Platform) is employed for the case study. The results reveal that the defect rate decreases from 1.00% (Original defect rate) to 0.21% with XGBoost and 0.13% with LightGBM, respectively.</description>

      <title>EchoQA: A Large Collection of Instruction Tuning Data for Echocardiogram Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel question-answering (QA) dataset using echocardiogram reports sourced from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database. This dataset is specifically designed to enhance QA systems in cardiology, consisting of 771,244 QA pairs addressing a wide array of cardiac abnormalities and their severity. We compare large language models (LLMs), including open-source and biomedical-specific models for zero-shot evaluation, and closed-source models for zero-shot and three-shot evaluation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs improves performance across various QA metrics, validating the value of our dataset. Clinicians also qualitatively evaluate the best-performing model to assess the LLM responses for correctness. Further, we conduct fine-grained fairness audits to assess the bias-performance trade-off of LLMs across various social determinants of health. Our objective is to propel the field forward by establishing a benchmark for LLM AI agents aimed at supporting clinicians with cardiac differential diagnoses, thereby reducing the documentation burden that contributes to clinician burnout and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.</description>

      <title>AutoEval: A Practical Framework for Autonomous Evaluation of Mobile Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and systematic evaluation of mobile agents can significantly advance their development and real-world applicability. However, existing benchmarks for mobile agents lack practicality and scalability due to the extensive manual effort required to define task reward signals and implement corresponding evaluation codes. To this end, we propose AutoEval, an autonomous agent evaluation framework that tests a mobile agent without any manual effort. First, we design a Structured Substate Representation to describe the UI state changes while agent execution, such that task reward signals can be automatically generated. Second, we utilize a Judge System that can autonomously evaluate agents' performance given the automatically generated task reward signals. By providing only a task description, our framework evaluates agents with fine-grained performance feedback to that task without any extra manual effort. We implement a prototype of our framework and validate the automatically generated task reward signals, finding over 93% coverage to human-annotated reward signals. Moreover, to prove the effectiveness of our autonomous Judge System, we manually verify its judge results and demonstrate that it achieves 94% accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the state-of-the-art mobile agents using our framework, providing detailed insights into their performance characteristics and limitations.</description>

      <title>Don't Get Too Excited -- Eliciting Emotions in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges of affect control in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to express appropriate emotional states during extended dialogues. We evaluated state-of-the-art open-weight LLMs to assess their affective expressive range in terms of arousal and valence. Our study employs a novel methodology combining LLM-based sentiment analysis with multiturn dialogue simulations between LLMs. We quantify the models' capacity to express a wide spectrum of emotions and how they fluctuate during interactions. Our findings reveal significant variations among LLMs in their ability to maintain consistent affect, with some models demonstrating more stable emotional trajectories than others. Furthermore, we identify key challenges in affect control, including difficulties in producing and maintaining extreme emotional states and limitations in adapting affect to changing conversational contexts. These findings have important implications for the development of more emotionally intelligent AI systems and highlight the need for improved affect modelling in LLMs.</description>

      <title>PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel PennyLane-Centric Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in code generation, natural language processing, and domain-specific reasoning. Their potential in aiding quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for the PennyLane framework-a leading platform for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific code samples of quantum circuits and their contextual descriptions, specifically curated to train/fine-tune LLM-based quantum code assistance. Our key contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic creation and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset leveraging quantum computing textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) the development of a systematic methodology for data refinement, annotation, and formatting to optimize LLM training efficiency; and (3) a thorough evaluation, based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset in streamlining PennyLane code generation and improving quantum development workflows. Compared to existing efforts that predominantly focus on Qiskit, our dataset significantly broadens the spectrum of quantum frameworks covered in AI-driven code assistance. By bridging this gap and providing reproducible dataset-creation methodologies, we aim to advance the field of AI-assisted quantum programming, making quantum computing more accessible to both newcomers and experienced developers.</description>

      <title>ROCKET-2: Steering Visuomotor Policy via Cross-View Goal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a goal specification method that is semantically clear, spatially sensitive, and intuitive for human users to guide agent interactions in embodied environments. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view goal alignment framework that allows users to specify target objects using segmentation masks from their own camera views rather than the agent's observations. We highlight that behavior cloning alone fails to align the agent's behavior with human intent when the human and agent camera views differ significantly. To address this, we introduce two auxiliary objectives: cross-view consistency loss and target visibility loss, which explicitly enhance the agent's spatial reasoning ability. According to this, we develop ROCKET-2, a state-of-the-art agent trained in Minecraft, achieving an improvement in the efficiency of inference 3x to 6x. We show ROCKET-2 can directly interpret goals from human camera views for the first time, paving the way for better human-agent interaction.</description>

      <title>Playing games with Large language models: Randomness and strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Playing games has a long history of describing intricate interactions in simplified forms. In this paper we explore if large language models (LLMs) can play games, investigating their capabilities for randomisation and strategic adaptation through both simultaneous and sequential game interactions. We focus on GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17 and test two games between LLMs: Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) and games of strategy (Prisoners Dilemma PD). LLMs are often described as stochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest that they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when prompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs appear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS converging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between cooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail programmatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI challenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games, just not very well. These results have implications for the use of LLMs in multi-agent LLM systems and showcase limitations in current approaches to model output for strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>The Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Transforming Unstructured Text to Standardized Formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.</description>

      <title>Seeding for Success: Skill and Stochasticity in Tabletop Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games often incorporate random elements in the form of dice or shuffled card decks. This randomness is a key contributor to the player experience and the variety of game situations encountered. There is a tension between a level of randomness that makes the game interesting and contributes to the player enjoyment of a game, and a level at which the outcome itself is effectively random and the game becomes dull. The optimal level for a game will depend on the design goals and target audience. We introduce a new technique to quantify the level of randomness in game outcome and use it to compare 15 tabletop games and disentangle the different contributions to the overall randomness from specific parts of some games. We further explore the interaction between game randomness and player skill, and how this innate randomness can affect error analysis in common game experiments.</description>

      <title>MindBridge: Scalable and Cross-Model Knowledge Editing via Memory-Augmented Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing is a technique for efficiently and accurately updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to alleviate obsolescence and correct errors. However, most existing methods overfit to specific models, causing edited knowledge to be discarded during each LLM update and requiring frequent re-editing, which is particularly burdensome in today's rapidly evolving open-source community. To address this issue, we propose the problem of cross-model knowledge editing and introduce MindBridge, a scalable solution inspired by the low coupling between modality processing and LLMs in multi-modal models. MindBridge introduces the novel concept of memory modality, which encodes edited knowledge as an independent modality. It first performs LLM-agnostic pre-training of the memory modality and then integrates it with various LLMs. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and popular knowledge editing datasets demonstrate that MindBridge achieves superior performance even in editing tens of thousands of knowledge entries and can flexibly adapt to different LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/CrashBugger/MindBridge.</description>

      <title>Prime Convolutional Model: Breaking the Ground for Theoretical Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theoretical approach to Explainable AI. Following the Scientific Method, this approach consists in formulating on the basis of empirical evidence, a mathematical model to explain and predict the behaviors of Neural Networks. We apply the method to a case study created in a controlled environment, which we call Prime Convolutional Model (p-Conv for short). p-Conv operates on a dataset consisting of the first one million natural numbers and is trained to identify the congruence classes modulo a given integer $m$. Its architecture uses a convolutional-type neural network that contextually processes a sequence of $B$ consecutive numbers to each input. We take an empirical approach and exploit p-Conv to identify the congruence classes of numbers in a validation set using different values for $m$ and $B$. The results show that the different behaviors of p-Conv (i.e., whether it can perform the task or not) can be modeled mathematically in terms of $m$ and $B$. The inferred mathematical model reveals interesting patterns able to explain when and why p-Conv succeeds in performing task and, if not, which error pattern it follows.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Architectural Synthesis Using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal Generative AI have the potential to democratize specialized architectural tasks, such as interpreting technical drawings and creating 3D CAD models, which traditionally require expert knowledge. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of two systems: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, in the task of architectural 3D synthesis. We conduct a case study on two buildings from Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1965): Villa Rotonda and Palazzo Porto. High-level architectural models and drawings of these buildings were prepared, inspired by Palladio's original texts and drawings. Through sequential text and image prompting, we assess the systems' abilities in (1) interpreting 2D and 3D representations of buildings from drawings, (2) encoding the buildings into a CAD software script, and (3) self-improving based on outputs. While both systems successfully generate individual parts, they struggle to accurately assemble these parts into the desired spatial relationships, with Claude 3.5 demonstrating better performance, particularly in self-correcting its output. This study contributes to ongoing research on benchmarking the strengths and weaknesses of off-the-shelf AI systems in performing intelligent human tasks that require discipline-specific knowledge. The findings highlight the potential of language-enabled AI systems to act as collaborative technical assistants in the architectural design process.</description>

Abstract: Researchers are increasingly subjecting artificial intelligence systems to psychological testing. But to rigorously compare their cognitive capacities with humans and other animals, we must avoid both over- and under-stating our similarities and differences.

      <title>Efficient Diffusion as Low Light Enhancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12346v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational burden of the iterative sampling process remains a major challenge in diffusion-based Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images. Following this, we introduce \textbf{Re}flectance-aware \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{Di}stilled \textbf{T}rajectory (\textbf{ReDDiT}), an efficient and flexible distillation framework tailored for LLIE. Our framework achieves comparable performance to previous diffusion-based methods with redundant steps in just 2 steps while establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 8 or 4 steps. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Machine Unlearning Techniques for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the machine unlearning techniques within the context of large language models (LLMs), referred to as \textit{LLM unlearning}. LLM unlearning offers a principled approach to removing the influence of undesirable data (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) from LLMs, while preserving their overall utility without requiring full retraining. Despite growing research interest, there is no comprehensive survey that systematically organizes existing work and distills key insights; here, we aim to bridge this gap. We begin by introducing the definition and the paradigms of LLM unlearning, followed by a comprehensive taxonomy of existing unlearning studies. Next, we categorize current unlearning approaches, summarizing their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we review evaluation metrics and benchmarks, providing a structured overview of current assessment methodologies. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the field.</description>

      <title>A Review of Artificial Intelligence Impacting Statistical Process Monitoring and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been 100 years since statistical process control (SPC) or statistical process monitoring (SPM) was first introduced for production processes and later applied to service, healthcare, and other industries. The techniques applied to SPM applications are mostly statistically oriented. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated the imagination of adopting AI for SPM applications. This manuscript begins with a concise review of the historical development of the statistically based SPM methods. Next, this manuscript explores AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods applied in various SPM applications, addressing quality characteristics of univariate, multivariate, profile, and image. These AI methods can be classified into the following categories: classification, pattern recognition, time series applications, and generative AI. Specifically, different kinds of neural networks, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN), are among the most implemented AI methods impacting SPM. Finally, this manuscript outlines a couple of future directions that harness the potential of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for advancing SPM research and applications in complex systems. The ultimate objective is to transform statistical process monitoring (SPM) into smart process control (SMPC), where corrective actions are autonomously implemented to either prevent quality issues or restore process performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models revolutionized medical education by enabling scalable and efficient learning solutions. This paper presents a pipeline employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to prepare comments generation for Poland's State Specialization Examination (PES) based on verified resources. The system integrates these generated comments and source documents with a spaced repetition learning algorithm to enhance knowledge retention while minimizing cognitive overload. By employing a refined retrieval system, query rephraser, and an advanced reranker, our modified RAG solution promotes accuracy more than efficiency. Rigorous evaluation by medical annotators demonstrates improvements in key metrics such as document relevance, credibility, and logical coherence of generated content, proven by a series of experiments presented in the paper. This study highlights the potential of RAG systems to provide scalable, high-quality, and individualized educational resources, addressing non-English speaking users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant technological progress and paradigm shifts. This survey provides an extensive review of recent advancements in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), which integrate visual and textual data to enhance healthcare outcomes. We discuss the foundational technology behind Med-VLMs, illustrating how general models are adapted for complex medical tasks, and examine their applications in healthcare. The transformative impact of Med-VLMs on clinical practice, education, and patient care is highlighted, alongside challenges such as data scarcity, narrow task generalization, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns like fairness, accountability, and privacy. These limitations are exacerbated by uneven dataset distribution, computational demands, and regulatory hurdles. Rigorous evaluation methods and robust regulatory frameworks are essential for safe integration into healthcare workflows. Future directions include leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets, improving cross-modal generalization, and enhancing interpretability. Innovations like federated learning, lightweight architectures, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration are explored as pathways to democratize access and improve clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Med-VLMs' strengths and limitations, fostering their ethical and balanced adoption in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Larger or Smaller Reward Margins to Select Preferences for Alignment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, with the quality of preference datasets playing a crucial role in this process. While existing metrics primarily assess data quality based on either explicit or implicit reward margins, they often provide contradictory evaluations for the same data. To address this issue, we introduce the alignment potential metric, which quantifies the gap from the model's current implicit reward margin to the target explicit reward margin, thereby estimating the model's potential to align with the preference data. Empirical results demonstrate that training on data selected by this metric consistently enhances alignment performance, surpassing existing metrics across different base models and optimization objectives. Furthermore, our method extends to self-play data generation frameworks, where the metric is used to identify high-quality data within the self-generated content by LLMs. Under this data generation scenario, our method surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various training settings and demonstrates continuous improvements in alignment performance as dataset size and training iterations increase.</description>

Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks can effectively induce unsafe behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, the transferability of these attacks across different models remains limited. This study aims to understand and enhance the transferability of gradient-based jailbreaking methods, which are among the standard approaches for attacking white-box models. Through a detailed analysis of the optimization process, we introduce a novel conceptual framework to elucidate transferability and identify superfluous constraints-specifically, the response pattern constraint and the token tail constraint-as significant barriers to improved transferability. Removing these unnecessary constraints substantially enhances the transferability and controllability of gradient-based attacks. Evaluated on Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the source model, our method increases the overall Transfer Attack Success Rate (T-ASR) across a set of target models with varying safety levels from 18.4% to 50.3%, while also improving the stability and controllability of jailbreak behaviors on both source and target models.</description>

      <title>Systems and Algorithms for Convolutional Multi-Hybrid Language Models at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce convolutional multi-hybrid architectures, with a design grounded on two simple observations. First, operators in hybrid models can be tailored to token manipulation tasks such as in-context recall, multi-token recall, and compression, with input-dependent convolutions and attention offering complementary performance. Second, co-designing convolution operators and hardware-aware algorithms enables efficiency gains in regimes where previous alternative architectures struggle to surpass Transformers. At the 40 billion parameter scale, we train end-to-end 1.2 to 2.9 times faster than optimized Transformers, and 1.1 to 1.4 times faster than previous generation hybrids. On H100 GPUs and model width 4096, individual operators in the proposed multi-hybrid StripedHyena 2 architecture achieve two-fold throughput improvement over linear attention and state-space models. Multi-hybrids excel at sequence modeling over byte-tokenized data, as demonstrated by the Evo 2 line of models. We discuss the foundations that enable these results, including architecture design, overlap-add blocked kernels for tensor cores, and dedicated all-to-all and point-to-point context parallelism strategies.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Extract Customer Needs as well as Professional Analysts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying customer needs (CNs) is important for product management, product development, and marketing. Applications rely on professional analysts interpreting textual data (e.g., interview transcripts, online reviews) to understand the nuances of customer experience and concisely formulate "jobs to be done." The task is cognitively complex and time-consuming. Current practice facilitates the process with keyword search and machine learning but relies on human judgment to formulate CNs. We examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically extract CNs. Because evaluating CNs requires professional judgment, we partnered with a marketing consulting firm to conduct a blind study of CNs extracted by: (1) a foundational LLM with prompt engineering only (Base LLM), (2) an LLM fine-tuned with professionally identified CNs (SFT LLM), and (3) professional analysts. The SFT LLM performs as well as or better than professional analysts when extracting CNs. The extracted CNs are well-formulated, sufficiently specific to identify opportunities, and justified by source content (no hallucinations). The SFT LLM is efficient and provides more complete coverage of CNs. The Base LLM was not sufficiently accurate or specific. Organizations can rely on SFT LLMs to reduce manual effort, enhance the precision of CN articulation, and provide improved insight for innovation and marketing strategy.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Instruction Following Policies via Trajectory Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of instructable agents in robotics or gaming is often hindered by limited data that pairs instructions with agent trajectories. However, large datasets of unannotated trajectories containing sequences of various agent behaviour (play trajectories) are often available. In a semi-supervised setup, we explore methods to extract labelled segments from play trajectories. The goal is to augment a small annotated dataset of instruction-trajectory pairs to improve the performance of an instruction-following policy trained downstream via imitation learning. Assuming little variation in segment length, recent video segmentation methods can effectively extract labelled segments. To address the constraint of segment length, we propose Play Segmentation (PS), a probabilistic model that finds maximum likely segmentations of extended subsegments, while only being trained on individual instruction segments. Our results in a game environment and a simulated robotic gripper setting underscore the importance of segmentation; randomly sampled segments diminish performance, while incorporating labelled segments from PS improves policy performance to the level of a policy trained on twice the amount of labelled data.</description>

      <title>FairGen: Controlling Sensitive Attributes for Fair Generations in Diffusion Models via Adaptive Latent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups, such as generating more males than females when prompted to generate images of engineers, raising ethical concerns and limiting their adoption. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., "male" for "gender") in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose FairGen, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Further, given the limitations of existing datasets in comprehensively assessing bias in diffusion models, we introduce a holistic bias evaluation benchmark HBE, covering diverse domains and incorporating complex prompts across various applications. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight FairGen's ability to flexibly and precisely control generation distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.</description>

      <title>Online Pseudo-average Shifting Attention(PASA) for Robust Low-precision LLM Inference: Algorithms and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention calculation is extremely time-consuming for long-sequence inference tasks, such as text or image/video generation, in large models. To accelerate this process, we developed a low-precision, mathematically-equivalent algorithm called PASA, based on Flash Attention. PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($&gt;65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix. This issue also applies to the Qwen models. Additionally, numerical accuracy is assessed through root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing the final generated texts and videos to those produced using high-precision attention.</description>

      <title>CABS: Conflict-Aware and Balanced Sparsification for Enhancing Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging based on task vectors, i.e., the parameter differences between fine-tuned models and a shared base model, provides an efficient way to integrate multiple task-specific models into a multitask model without retraining. Recent works have endeavored to address the conflicts between task vectors, one of the significant challenges faced by model merging, through sparsification; however, two issues significantly limit their performance: high parameter overlap and unbalanced weight distribution. To address these issues, we propose a simple, yet effective framework called CABS (Conflict-Aware and Balanced Sparsification), consisting of Conflict-Aware Sparsification (CA) and Balanced Sparsification (BS). CA can reduce parameter overlap by applying masks during sequential pruning, ensuring that each task vector retains distinct, non-overlapping parameters. BS leverages $n$: $m$ pruning to preserve critical weights while maintaining an even distribution across layers. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CABS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks and model sizes.</description>

      <title>Time-MQA: Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering with Context Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data are foundational in finance, healthcare, and energy domains. However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, executable codes, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and results have all been open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Starjob: Dataset for LLM-Driven Job Shop Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, but their potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a classic challenge in combinatorial optimization that requires efficient job allocation to machines to minimize makespan. To this end, we introduce Starjob, the first supervised dataset for JSSP, comprising 130k instances specifically designed for training LLMs. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune the LLaMA 8B 4-bit quantized model with the LoRA method to develop an end-to-end scheduling approach. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed LLM-based method not only surpasses traditional Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) but also achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art neural approaches like L2D, with an average improvement of 15.36% on DMU and 7.85% on Taillard benchmarks. These results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs in tackling combinatorial optimization problems, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</description>

      <title>District Vitality Index Using Machine Learning Methods for Urban Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: City leaders face critical decisions regarding budget allocation and investment priorities. How can they identify which city districts require revitalization? To address this challenge, a Current Vitality Index and a Long-Term Vitality Index are proposed. These indexes are based on a carefully curated set of indicators. Missing data is handled using K-Nearest Neighbors imputation, while Random Forest is employed to identify the most reliable and significant features. Additionally, k-means clustering is utilized to generate meaningful data groupings for enhanced monitoring of Long-Term Vitality. Current vitality is visualized through an interactive map, while Long-Term Vitality is tracked over 15 years with predictions made using Multilayer Perceptron or Linear Regression. The results, approved by urban planners, are already promising and helpful, with the potential for further improvement as more data becomes available. This paper proposes leveraging machine learning methods to optimize urban planning and enhance citizens' quality of life.</description>

      <title>BEYONDWORDS is All You Need: Agentic Generative AI based Social Media Themes Extractor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thematic analysis of social media posts provides a major understanding of public discourse, yet traditional methods often struggle to capture the complexity and nuance of unstructured, large-scale text data. This study introduces a novel methodology for thematic analysis that integrates tweet embeddings from pre-trained language models, dimensionality reduction using and matrix factorization, and generative AI to identify and refine latent themes. Our approach clusters compressed tweet representations and employs generative AI to extract and articulate themes through an agentic Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, with a secondary LLM for quality assurance. This methodology is applied to tweets from the autistic community, a group that increasingly uses social media to discuss their experiences and challenges. By automating the thematic extraction process, the aim is to uncover key insights while maintaining the richness of the original discourse. This autism case study demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in improving thematic analysis of social media data, offering a scalable and adaptable framework that can be applied to diverse contexts. The results highlight the potential of combining machine learning and Generative AI to enhance the depth and accuracy of theme identification in online communities.</description>

      <title>Mapping representations in Reinforcement Learning via Semantic Alignment for Zero-Shot Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) models often fail to generalize when even small changes occur in the environment's observations or task requirements. Addressing these shifts typically requires costly retraining, limiting the reusability of learned policies. In this paper, we build on recent work in semantic alignment to propose a zero-shot method for mapping between latent spaces across different agents trained on different visual and task variations. Specifically, we learn a transformation that maps embeddings from one agent's encoder to another agent's encoder without further fine-tuning. Our approach relies on a small set of "anchor" observations that are semantically aligned, which we use to estimate an affine or orthogonal transform. Once the transformation is found, an existing controller trained for one domain can interpret embeddings from a different (existing) encoder in a zero-shot fashion, skipping additional trainings. We empirically demonstrate that our framework preserves high performance under visual and task domain shifts. We empirically demonstrate zero-shot stitching performance on the CarRacing environment with changing background and task. By allowing modular re-assembly of existing policies, it paves the way for more robust, compositional RL in dynamically changing environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Surrogates for Offline Black-Box Optimization via Gradient Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline design optimization problem arises in numerous science and engineering applications including material and chemical design, where expensive online experimentation necessitates the use of in silico surrogate functions to predict and maximize the target objective over candidate designs. Although these surrogates can be learned from offline data, their predictions are often inaccurate outside the offline data regime. This challenge raises a fundamental question about the impact of imperfect surrogate model on the performance gap between its optima and the true optima, and to what extent the performance loss can be mitigated. Although prior work developed methods to improve the robustness of surrogate models and their associated optimization processes, a provably quantifiable relationship between an imperfect surrogate and the corresponding performance gap, as well as whether prior methods directly address it, remain elusive. To shed light on this important question, we present a theoretical framework to understand offline black-box optimization, by explicitly bounding the optimization quality based on how well the surrogate matches the latent gradient field that underlines the offline data. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we propose a principled black-box gradient matching algorithm to create effective surrogate models for offline optimization, improving over prior approaches on various real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Contextual Quantum Neural Networks for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply quantum machine learning (QML) to predict the stock prices of multiple assets using a contextual quantum neural network. Our approach captures recent trends to predict future stock price distributions, moving beyond traditional models that focus on entire historical data, enhancing adaptability and precision. Utilizing the principles of quantum superposition, we introduce a new training technique called the quantum batch gradient update (QBGU), which accelerates the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in quantum applications and improves convergence. Consequently, we propose a quantum multi-task learning (QMTL) architecture, specifically, the share-and-specify ansatz, that integrates task-specific operators controlled by quantum labels, enabling the simultaneous and efficient training of multiple assets on the same quantum circuit as well as enabling efficient portfolio representation with logarithmic overhead in the number of qubits. This architecture represents the first of its kind in quantum finance, offering superior predictive power and computational efficiency for multi-asset stock price forecasting. Through extensive experimentation on S\&amp;P 500 data for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon stocks, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms quantum single-task learning (QSTL) models but also effectively captures inter-asset correlations, leading to enhanced prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of QML in financial applications, paving the way for more advanced, resource-efficient quantum algorithms in stock price prediction and other complex financial modeling tasks.</description>

Abstract: Many dynamic decision problems, such as robotic control, involve a series of tasks, many of which are unknown at training time. Typical approaches for these problems, such as multi-task and meta reinforcement learning, do not generalize well when the tasks are diverse. On the other hand, approaches that aim to tackle task diversity, such as using task embedding as policy context and task clustering, typically lack performance guarantees and require a large number of training tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning a policy committee that includes at least one near-optimal policy with high probability for tasks encountered during execution. While we show that this problem is in general inapproximable, we present two practical algorithmic solutions. The first yields provable approximation and task sample complexity guarantees when tasks are low-dimensional (the best we can do due to inapproximability), whereas the second is a general and practical gradient-based approach. In addition, we provide a provable sample complexity bound for few-shot learning. Our experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task, meta-, and task clustering baselines in training, generalization, and few-shot learning, often by a large margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning methodologies such as BERT, FinBERT and ULMFiT for sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts. The objective is to investigate how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be leveraged to extract sentiment from large-scale financial transcripts, thereby aiding in more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies. We examine the strengths and limitations of each model in the context of financial sentiment analysis, focusing on data preprocessing requirements, computational efficiency, and model optimization. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate their performance using key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we discuss potential enhancements to improve the effectiveness of these models in financial text analysis, providing insights into their applicability for real-world financial decision-making.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence have led to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, adapting these pre-trained models to dynamic data distributions and various tasks efficiently remains a challenge. Fine-tuning MLLMs for specific tasks often causes performance degradation in the model's prior knowledge domain, a problem known as 'Catastrophic Forgetting'. While this issue has been well-studied in the Continual Learning (CL) community, it presents new challenges for MLLMs. This review paper, the first of its kind in MLLM continual learning, presents an overview and analysis of 440 research papers in this area.The review is structured into four sections. First, it discusses the latest research on MLLMs, covering model innovations, benchmarks, and applications in various fields. Second, it categorizes and overviews the latest studies on continual learning, divided into three parts: non-large language models unimodal continual learning (Non-LLM Unimodal CL), non-large language models multimodal continual learning (Non-LLM Multimodal CL), and continual learning in large language models (CL in LLM). The third section provides a detailed analysis of the current state of MLLM continual learning research, including benchmark evaluations, architectural innovations, and a summary of theoretical and empirical studies.Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and future directions of continual learning in MLLMs, aiming to inspire future research and development in the field. This review connects the foundational concepts, theoretical insights, method innovations, and practical applications of continual learning for multimodal large models, providing a comprehensive understanding of the research progress and challenges in this field, aiming to inspire researchers in the field and promote the advancement of related technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Transformer with GNN Structural Knowledge via Distillation: A Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating the structural inductive biases of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the global contextual modeling capabilities of Transformers represents a pivotal challenge in graph representation learning. While GNNs excel at capturing localized topological patterns through message-passing mechanisms, their inherent limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and parallelizability hinder their deployment in large-scale scenarios. Conversely, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to achieve global receptive fields but struggle to inherit the intrinsic graph structural priors of GNNs. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework that systematically transfers multiscale structural knowledge from GNN teacher models to Transformer student models, offering a new perspective on addressing the critical challenges in cross-architectural distillation. The framework effectively bridges the architectural gap between GNNs and Transformers through micro-macro distillation losses and multiscale feature alignment. This work establishes a new paradigm for inheriting graph structural biases in Transformer architectures, with broad application prospects.</description>

      <title>LIVS: A Pluralistic Alignment Dataset for Inclusive Public Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Local Intersectional Visual Spaces (LIVS) dataset, a benchmark for multi-criteria alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models in inclusive urban planning. Developed through a two-year participatory process with 30 community organizations, LIVS encodes diverse spatial preferences across 634 initial concepts, consolidated into six core criteria: Accessibility, Safety, Comfort, Invitingness, Inclusivity, and Diversity, through 37,710 pairwise comparisons. Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL, we observed a measurable increase in alignment with community preferences, though a significant proportion of neutral ratings highlights the complexity of modeling intersectional needs. Additionally, as annotation volume increases, accuracy shifts further toward the DPO-tuned model, suggesting that larger-scale preference data enhances fine-tuning effectiveness. LIVS underscores the necessity of integrating context-specific, stakeholder-driven criteria into generative modeling and provides a resource for evaluating AI alignment methodologies across diverse socio-spatial contexts.</description>

      <title>Evaluating System 1 vs. 2 Reasoning Approaches for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting: A Benchmark and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning ability is crucial for solving challenging tasks. With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

      <title>Neuroplasticity and Corruption in Model Mechanisms: A Case Study Of Indirect Object Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that fine-tuning language models on general tasks enhance their underlying mechanisms. However, the impact of fine-tuning on poisoned data and the resulting changes in these mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates the changes in a model's mechanisms during toxic fine-tuning and identifies the primary corruption mechanisms. We also analyze the changes after retraining a corrupted model on the original dataset and observe neuroplasticity behaviors, where the model relearns original mechanisms after fine-tuning the corrupted model. Our findings indicate that: (i) Underlying mechanisms are amplified across task-specific fine-tuning which can be generalized to longer epochs, (ii) Model corruption via toxic fine-tuning is localized to specific circuit components, (iii) Models exhibit neuroplasticity when retraining corrupted models on clean dataset, reforming the original model mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning-Aided Super-Resolution Scheme for Channel Reconstruction and Generalization in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel reconstruction and generalization capability are of equal importance for developing channel estimation schemes within deep learning (DL) framework. In this paper, we exploit a novel DL-based scheme for efficient OFDM channel estimation where the neural networks for channel reconstruction and generalization are respectively designed. For the former, we propose a dual-attention-aided super-resolution neural network (DA-SRNN) to map the channels at pilot positions to the whole time-frequency channels. Specifically, the channel-spatial attention mechanism is first introduced to sequentially infer attention maps along two separate dimensions corresponding to two types of underlying channel correlations, and then the lightweight SR module is developed for efficient channel reconstruction. For the latter, we introduce continual learning (CL)-aided training strategies to make the neural network adapt to different channel distributions. Specifically, the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is introduced as the regularization term in regard to loss function of channel reconstruction, which can constrain the direction and space of updating the important weights of neural networks among different channel distributions. Meanwhile, the corresponding training process is provided in detail. By evaluating under 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) channel models, numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed channel estimation scheme with significantly improved channel reconstruction and generalization performance over counterparts.</description>

      <title>FASTer: Focal Token Acquiring-and-Scaling Transformer for Long-term 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent top-performing temporal 3D detectors based on Lidars have increasingly adopted region-based paradigms. They first generate coarse proposals, followed by encoding and fusing regional features. However, indiscriminate sampling and fusion often overlook the varying contributions of individual points and lead to exponentially increased complexity as the number of input frames grows. Moreover, arbitrary result-level concatenation limits the global information extraction. In this paper, we propose a Focal Token Acquring-and-Scaling Transformer (FASTer), which dynamically selects focal tokens and condenses token sequences in an adaptive and lightweight manner. Emphasizing the contribution of individual tokens, we propose a simple but effective Adaptive Scaling mechanism to capture geometric contexts while sifting out focal points. Adaptively storing and processing only focal points in historical frames dramatically reduces the overall complexity. Furthermore, a novel Grouped Hierarchical Fusion strategy is proposed, progressively performing sequence scaling and Intra-Group Fusion operations to facilitate the exchange of global spatial and temporal information. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our FASTer significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in both performance and efficiency while also exhibiting improved flexibility and robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/FASTer.git.</description>

      <title>LLM-Empowered Class Imbalanced Graph Prompt Learning for Online Drug Trafficking Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the market for illicit drugs remains extremely profitable, major online platforms have become direct-to-consumer intermediaries for illicit drug trafficking participants. These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combating this challenge are generally impractical, due to the imbalance of classes and scarcity of labeled samples in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT, that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify drug trafficking activities in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over the unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, we employ LLM to augment the HG by generating high-quality synthetic user nodes in minority classes. Then, we fine-tune the soft prompts on the augmented HG to capture the important information in the minority classes for the downstream drug trafficking detection task. To comprehensively study online illicit drug trafficking activities, we collect a new HG dataset over Twitter, called Twitter-HetDrug. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of LLM-HetGDT.</description>

      <title>Identifying Sensitive Weights via Post-quantization Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly. However, post-training weight quantization can address this problem by both compressing their sizes for limited memory and saving bandwidth for acceleration. As not all weight dimensions are equally important, those methods typically rely on a sensitivity metric, which indicates the element-wise influence of weights on loss function and is used to preprocess original weights for better quantization. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the accuracy of the sensitivity metric, and find that existing gradient and Hessian based metrics are very inaccurate: they underestimate quantization's impact on the loss function by orders of magnitude, mainly due to the small convergence radius of local 2nd order approximation, \ie, gradient and Hessian term in Taylor's formula. To tackle this problem, we propose Post-quantization Integral (PQI), an accurate metric to estimate posterior sensitivity in a fine-grained manner. To leverage this accurate metric, we further propose ReQuant, a simple yet powerful framework that mainly consists of two Dense-and-Sparse detach components: self-adaptive outlier selection and step-wise significant weights detach. Results show that ReQuant boosts state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods, with a pronounced improvement of 2.66 perplexity gain on Llama 3.2 1B with QTIP.</description>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify online misinformation, they also show promise in tackling misinformation. In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs -- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails. Our results have implications for both researchers and non-technical users.</description>

      <title>PsychBench: A comprehensive and professional benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLM-assisted psychiatric clinical practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers potential solutions to address problems such as shortage of medical resources and low diagnostic consistency in psychiatric clinical practice. Despite this potential, a robust and comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in authentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the advancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In response to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and clinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the practical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and investigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input text length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance. Through detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential limitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement. Subsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying seniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing LLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the quantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models demonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making tools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates that, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for junior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall clinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset and evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the application of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings.</description>

      <title>What are You Looking at? Modality Contribution in Multimodal Medical Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose High dimensional, multimodal data can nowadays be analyzed by huge deep neural networks with little effort. Several fusion methods for bringing together different modalities have been developed. Particularly, in the field of medicine with its presence of high dimensional multimodal patient data, multimodal models characterize the next step. However, what is yet very underexplored is how these models process the source information in detail. Methods To this end, we implemented an occlusion-based both model and performance agnostic modality contribution method that quantitatively measures the importance of each modality in the dataset for the model to fulfill its task. We applied our method to three different multimodal medical problems for experimental purposes. Results Herein we found that some networks have modality preferences that tend to unimodal collapses, while some datasets are imbalanced from the ground up. Moreover, we could determine a link between our metric and the performance of single modality trained nets. Conclusion The information gain through our metric holds remarkable potential to improve the development of multimodal models and the creation of datasets in the future. With our method we make a crucial contribution to the field of interpretability in deep learning based multimodal research and thereby notably push the integrability of multimodal AI into clinical practice.

Abstract: Prior parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms reduce memory usage and computational costs of fine-tuning large neural network models by training only a few additional adapter parameters, rather than the entire model. However, the reduction in computational costs due to PEFT does not necessarily translate to a reduction in training time; although the computational costs of the adapter layers are much smaller than the pretrained layers, it is well known that those two types of layers are processed sequentially on GPUs, resulting in significant latency overhead. LoRA and its variants merge low-rank adapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency overhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the adapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate this issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes randomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of introducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed by eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the adapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only partial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for gradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and total memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various fine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction tuning on the Oasst1 dataset. PaCA can also be combined with quantization, enabling the fine-tuning of large models such as LLaMA3.1-70B. In addition, PaCA enables training with 23% longer sequence and improves throughput by 16% on both NVIDIA A100 GPU and INTEL Gaudi2 HPU compared to LoRA.

      <title>Learning to Chain Operations by Routing Information Through a Global Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>UDora: A Unified Red Teaming Framework against LLM Agents by Dynamically Hijacking Their Own Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for handling complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements also amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, particularly when LLM agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Moreover, because LLM agents engage in extensive reasoning or planning before executing final actions, manipulating them into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains a significant challenge. Consequently, directly embedding adversarial strings in malicious instructions or injecting malicious prompts into tool interactions has become less effective against modern LLM agents. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM Agents that dynamically leverages the agent's own reasoning processes to compel it toward malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first samples the model's reasoning for the given task, then automatically identifies multiple optimal positions within these reasoning traces to insert targeted perturbations. Subsequently, it uses the modified reasoning as the objective to optimize the adversarial strings. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can transformers learn to perform algorithmic tasks reliably across previously unseen input/output domains? While pre-trained language models show solid accuracy on benchmarks incorporating algorithmic reasoning, assessing the reliability of these results necessitates an ability to cleanse models' functional capabilities from memorization. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic benchmark comprising six tasks of infinite input domains where we can also disentangle and trace the correct, robust algorithm necessary for the task. This allows us to assess (i) models' ability to extrapolate to unseen types of inputs, including new lengths, value ranges or input domains, but also (ii) to assess the robustness of the functional mechanism in recent models through the lens of their attention maps. We make the implementation of all our tasks and interoperability methods publicly available at https://github.com/michalspiegel/AttentionSpan .</description>

      <title>dyAb: Flow Matching for Flexible Antibody Design with AlphaFold-driven Pre-binding Antigen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of therapeutic antibodies heavily relies on accurate predictions of how antigens will interact with antibodies. Existing computational methods in antibody design often overlook crucial conformational changes that antigens undergo during the binding process, significantly impacting the reliability of the resulting antibodies. To bridge this gap, we introduce dyAb, a flexible framework that incorporates AlphaFold2-driven predictions to model pre-binding antigen structures and specifically addresses the dynamic nature of antigen conformation changes. Our dyAb model leverages a unique combination of coarse-grained interface alignment and fine-grained flow matching techniques to simulate the interaction dynamics and structural evolution of the antigen-antibody complex, providing a realistic representation of the binding process. Extensive experiments show that dyAb significantly outperforms existing models in antibody design involving changing antigen conformations. These results highlight dyAb's potential to streamline the design process for therapeutic antibodies, promising more efficient development cycles and improved outcomes in clinical applications.</description>

Abstract: As deep learning models grow in complexity, achieving model-agnostic interpretability becomes increasingly vital. In this work, we employ post-hoc conceptual contrastive edits to expose noteworthy patterns and biases imprinted in representations of retrieval models. We systematically design optimal and controllable contrastive interventions targeting various parts of speech, and effectively apply them to explain both linguistic and visiolinguistic pre-trained models in a black-box manner. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric to assess the per-word impact of contrastive interventions on model outcomes, providing a comprehensive evaluation of each intervention's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>How to Steer LLM Latents for Hallucination Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs pose a significant concern to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning with combinatorial actions for coupled restless bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly been applied to solve real-world planning problems, with progress in handling large state spaces and time horizons. However, a key bottleneck in many domains is that RL methods cannot accommodate large, combinatorially structured action spaces. In such settings, even representing the set of feasible actions at a single step may require a complex discrete optimization formulation. We leverage recent advances in embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods -- which cannot address sequential planning and combinatorial selection simultaneously -- by an average of 26.4% on these difficult instances.</description>

      <title>NCL-UoR at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Detecting Multilingual Hallucination and Related Observable Overgeneration Text Spans with Modified RefChecker and Modified SeflCheckGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 3 (Mu-SHROOM) focuses on detecting hallucinations in content generated by various large language models (LLMs) across multiple languages. This task involves not only identifying the presence of hallucinations but also pinpointing their specific occurrences. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces two methods: modified RefChecker and modified SelfCheckGPT. The modified RefChecker integrates prompt-based factual verification into References, structuring them as claim-based tests rather than single external knowledge sources. The modified SelfCheckGPT incorporates external knowledge to overcome its reliance on internal knowledge. In addition, both methods' original prompt designs are enhanced to identify hallucinated words within LLM-generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving a high ranking on the test dataset in detecting hallucinations across various languages, with an average IoU of 0.5310 and an average COR of 0.5669.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, but their safety under adversarial conditions remains a challenge. This study examines the impact of output length on the robustness of DeepSeek-R1, particularly in Forced Thinking scenarios. We analyze responses across various adversarial prompts and find that while longer outputs can improve safety through self-correction, certain attack types exploit extended generations. Our findings suggest that output length should be dynamically controlled to balance reasoning effectiveness and security. We propose reinforcement learning-based policy adjustments and adaptive token length regulation to enhance LLM safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical challenge in deploying deep neural networks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is a widely recognized defense strategy, most existing studies focus on balanced datasets, overlooking the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data, which significantly complicates robustness. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions and identifies limitations in the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework, TAET, which integrates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified equalization adversarial training phase. Additionally, prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely ignored the crucial evaluation metric of balanced accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of balanced robustness, a comprehensive metric tailored for assessing robustness under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing advanced defenses, achieving significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency. This work represents a substantial advancement in addressing robustness challenges in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to process non-human-readable text sequences, such as jailbreak prompts, often viewed as a bug for aligned LLMs. In this work, we present a systematic investigation challenging this perception, demonstrating that unnatural languages - strings that appear incomprehensible to humans but maintain semantic meanings for LLMs - contain latent features usable by models. Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.</description>

      <title>QCS-ADME: Quantum Circuit Search for Drug Property Prediction with Imbalanced Data and Regression Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biomedical field is beginning to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) for tasks traditionally handled by classical machine learning, especially in predicting ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties, which are essential in drug evaluation. However, ADME tasks pose unique challenges for existing quantum computing systems (QCS) frameworks, as they involve both classification with unbalanced dataset and regression problems. These dual requirements make it necessary to adapt and refine current QCS frameworks to effectively address the complexities of ADME predictions. We propose a novel training-free scoring mechanism to evaluate QML circuit performance on imbalanced classification and regression tasks. Our mechanism demonstrates significant correlation between scoring metrics and test performance on imbalanced classification tasks. Additionally, we develop methods to quantify continuous similarity relationships between quantum states, enabling performance prediction for regression tasks. This represents the first comprehensive approach to searching and evaluating QCS circuits specifically for regression applications. Validation on representative ADME tasks-one imbalanced classification and one regression-demonstrates moderate positive correlation between our scoring metrics and circuit performance, significantly outperforming baseline scoring methods that show negligible correlation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Generative Flow Network for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research into solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained significant traction, particularly through the application of deep (reinforcement) learning for end-to-end solution construction. However, many current construction-based neural solvers predominantly utilize Transformer architectures, which can face scalability challenges and struggle to produce diverse solutions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework beyond Transformer-based approaches, i.e., Adversarial Generative Flow Networks (AGFN). This framework integrates the generative flow network (GFlowNet)-a probabilistic model inherently adept at generating diverse solutions (routes)-with a complementary model for discriminating (or evaluating) the solutions. These models are trained alternately in an adversarial manner to improve the overall solution quality, followed by a proposed hybrid decoding method to construct the solution. We apply the AGFN framework to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and travelling salesman problem (TSP), and our experimental results demonstrate that AGFN surpasses the popular construction-based neural solvers, showcasing strong generalization capabilities on synthetic and real-world benchmark instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks either focus on single-agent tasks or are confined to narrow domains, failing to capture the dynamics of multi-agent coordination and competition. In this paper, we introduce MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Our framework measures not only task completion but also the quality of collaboration and competition using novel, milestone-based key performance indicators. Moreover, we evaluate various coordination protocols (including star, chain, tree, and graph topologies) and innovative strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, gpt-4o-mini reaches the average highest task score, graph structure performs the best among coordination protocols in the research scenario, and cognitive planning improves milestone achievement rates by 3%.

      <title>Decision-Focused Fine-Tuning of Time Series Foundation Models for Dispatchable Feeder Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series foundation models provide a universal solution for generating forecasts to support optimization problems in energy systems. Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Tabular Data Detection In the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified across different tables. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose four table-agnostic detectors combined with simple preprocessing schemes that we evaluate on six evaluation protocols, with different levels of ''wildness''. Our results show that cross-table learning on a restricted set of tables is possible even with naive preprocessing schemes. They confirm however that cross-table transfer (i.e. deployment on a table that has not been seen before) is challenging. This suggests that sophisticated encoding schemes are required to handle this problem.</description>

      <title>AskToAct: Enhancing LLMs Tool Use via Self-Correcting Clarification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness by fine-tuning on error-correction augmented data using selective masking mechanism, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 79% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 48.34% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across varying complexity levels and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 with substantially fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>Task Scheduling &amp; Forgetting in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can forget tasks they have previously been trained on. There is a rich body of work on such forgetting effects in humans. Therefore we look for commonalities in the forgetting behavior of humans and RL agents across tasks and test the viability of forgetting prevention measures from learning theory in RL. We find that in many cases, RL agents exhibit forgetting curves similar to those of humans. Methods like Leitner or SuperMemo have been shown to be effective at counteracting human forgetting, but we demonstrate they do not transfer as well to RL. We identify a likely cause: asymmetrical learning and retention patterns between tasks that cannot be captured by retention-based or performance-based curriculum strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a rigorous mathematical framework for neural network explainability, and more broadly for the explainability of equivariant operators called Group Equivariant Operators (GEOs) based on Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) transformations. The central concept involves quantifying the distance between GEOs by measuring the non-commutativity of specific diagrams. Additionally, the paper proposes a definition of interpretability of GEOs according to a complexity measure that can be defined according to each user preferences. Moreover, we explore the formal properties of this framework and show how it can be applied in classical machine learning scenarios, like image classification with convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Recurrence-Enhanced Vision-and-Language Transformers for Robust Multimodal Document Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is gaining increasing efficacy and interest from the research community, thanks to large-scale training, novel architectural and learning designs, and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs. In this paper, we move a step forward and design an approach that allows for multimodal queries, composed of both an image and a text, and can search within collections of multimodal documents, where images and text are interleaved. Our model, ReT, employs multi-level representations extracted from different layers of both visual and textual backbones, both at the query and document side. To allow for multi-level and cross-modal understanding and feature extraction, ReT employs a novel Transformer-based recurrent cell that integrates both textual and visual features at different layers, and leverages sigmoidal gates inspired by the classical design of LSTMs. Extensive experiments on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks show that ReT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/ReT.</description>

      <title>Proportionality in Thumbs Up and Down Voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the decision-making setting where agents elect a panel by expressing both positive and negative preferences. Prominently, in constitutional AI, citizens democratically select a slate of ethical preferences on which a foundation model is to be trained. There, in practice, agents may both approve and disapprove of different ethical principles. Proportionality has been well-studied in computational social choice for approval ballots, but its meaning remains unclear when negative sentiments are also considered. In this work, we propose two conceptually distinct approaches to interpret proportionality in the presence of up and down votes. The first approach treats the satisfaction from electing candidates and the impact of vetoing them as comparable, leading to combined proportionality guarantees. The second approach considers veto power separately, introducing guarantees distinct from traditional proportionality. We formalize axioms for each perspective and examine their satisfiability by suitable adaptations of Phragm\'en's rule, Proportional Approval Voting rule and the Method of Equal Shares.</description>

Abstract: Manual curation of evaluation datasets is struggling to keep up with the rapidly expanding capabilities and deployment scenarios of language models. Towards scalable model profiling, we introduce and validate a framework for evaluating LLMs, called Adaptive Evaluations. Adaptive evaluations use scaffolded language models (evaluator agents) to search through a target model's behavior on a domain dataset and create difficult questions (tasks) that can discover and probe the model's failure modes. We find that frontier models lack consistency when adaptively probed with our framework on a diverse suite of datasets and tasks, including but not limited to legal reasoning, forecasting, and online harassment. Generated questions pass human validity checks and often transfer to other models with different capability profiles, demonstrating that adaptive evaluations can also be used to create difficult domain-specific datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in Generative AI enables the stylization of 3D models based on image prompts. However, these methods do not incorporate tactile information, leading to designs that lack the expected tactile properties. We present TactStyle, a system that allows creators to stylize 3D models with images while incorporating the expected tactile properties. TactStyle accomplishes this using a modified image-generation model fine-tuned to generate heightfields for given surface textures. By optimizing 3D model surfaces to embody a generated texture, TactStyle creates models that match the desired style and replicate the tactile experience. We utilize a large-scale dataset of textures to train our texture generation model. In a psychophysical experiment, we evaluate the tactile qualities of a set of 3D-printed original textures and TactStyle's generated textures. Our results show that TactStyle successfully generates a wide range of tactile features from a single image input, enabling a novel approach to haptic design.</description>

      <title>Mind the (Belief) Gap: Group Identity in the World of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%. Bridging social psychology and AI, our work provides insights to navigate real-world interactions using LLMs while addressing belief-driven biases.</description>

Abstract: This study examines how large language models categorize sentences from scientific papers using prompt engineering. We use two advanced web-based models, GPT-4o (by OpenAI) and DeepSeek R1, to classify sentences into predefined relationship categories. DeepSeek R1 has been tested on benchmark datasets in its technical report. However, its performance in scientific text categorization remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new evaluation method designed specifically for this task. We also compile a dataset of cleaned scientific papers from diverse domains. This dataset provides a platform for comparing the two models. Using this dataset, we analyze their effectiveness and consistency in categorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal learning strategies for improving radiology reporting. The source code is available at https://github.com/zzs95/abn-blip.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>FRMD: Fast Robot Motion Diffusion with Consistency-Distilled Movement Primitives for Smooth Action Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of using diffusion models to generate fast, smooth, and temporally consistent robot motions. Although diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance in robot learning due to their task scalability and multi-modal flexibility, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) they often produce non-smooth, jerky motions due to their inability to capture temporally consistent movement dynamics, and (2) their iterative sampling process incurs prohibitive latency for many robotic tasks. Inspired by classic robot motion generation methods such as DMPs and ProMPs, which capture temporally and spatially consistent dynamic of trajectories using low-dimensional vectors -- and by recent advances in diffusion-based image generation that use consistency models with probability flow ODEs to accelerate the denoising process, we propose Fast Robot Motion Diffusion (FRMD). FRMD uniquely integrates Movement Primitives (MPs) with Consistency Models to enable efficient, single-step trajectory generation. By leveraging probabilistic flow ODEs and consistency distillation, our method models trajectory distributions while learning a compact, time-continuous motion representation within an encoder-decoder architecture. This unified approach eliminates the slow, multi-step denoising process of conventional diffusion models, enabling efficient one-step inference and smooth robot motion generation. We extensively evaluated our FRMD on the well-recognized Meta-World and ManiSkills Benchmarks, ranging from simple to more complex manipulation tasks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that FRMD generates significantly faster, smoother trajectories while achieving higher success rates.</description>

      <title>Hebbian learning the local structure of language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in the brain is local and unsupervised (Hebbian). We derive the foundations of an effective human language model inspired by these microscopic constraints. It has two parts: (1) a hierarchy of neurons which learns to tokenize words from text (whichiswhatyoudowhenyoureadthis); and (2) additional neurons which bind the learned symanticless patterns of the tokenizer into a symanticful token (an embedding). The model permits continuous parallel learning without forgetting; and is a powerful tokenizer which performs renormalization group. This allows it to exploit redundancy, such that it generates tokens which are always decomposable into a basis set (e.g an alphabet), and can mix features learned from multiple languages. We find that the structure of this model allows it to learn a natural language morphology WITHOUT data. The language data generated by this model predicts the correct distribution of word-forming patterns observed in real languages, and further demonstrates why microscopically human speech is broken up into words. This model provides the basis for understanding the microscopic origins of language and human creativity.</description>

      <title>Survey Perspective: The Role of Explainable AI in Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on AI-based security tools in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) has transformed threat detection and response, yet analysts frequently struggle with alert overload, false positives, and lack of contextual relevance. The inability to effectively analyze AI-generated security alerts lead to inefficiencies in incident response and reduces trust in automated decision-making. In this paper, we show results and analysis of our investigation of how SOC analysts navigate AI-based alerts, their challenges with current security tools, and how explainability (XAI) integrated into their security workflows has the potential to become an effective decision support. In this vein, we conducted an industry survey. Using the survey responses, we analyze how security analysts' process, retrieve, and prioritize alerts. Our findings indicate that most analysts have not yet adopted XAI-integrated tools, but they express high interest in attack attribution, confidence scores, and feature contribution explanations to improve interpretability, and triage efficiency. Based on our findings, we also propose practical design recommendations for XAI-enhanced security alert systems, enabling AI-based cybersecurity solutions to be more transparent, interpretable, and actionable.</description>

      <title>AI persuading AI vs AI persuading Humans: LLMs' Differential Effectiveness in Promoting Pro-Environmental Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) is vital to combat climate change, yet turning awareness into intention and action remains elusive. We explore large language models (LLMs) as tools to promote PEB, comparing their impact across 3,200 participants: real humans (n=1,200), simulated humans based on actual participant data (n=1,200), and fully synthetic personas (n=1,200). All three participant groups faced personalized or standard chatbots, or static statements, employing four persuasion strategies (moral foundations, future self-continuity, action orientation, or "freestyle" chosen by the LLM). Results reveal a "synthetic persuasion paradox": synthetic and simulated agents significantly affect their post-intervention PEB stance, while human responses barely shift. Simulated participants better approximate human trends but still overestimate effects. This disconnect underscores LLM's potential for pre-evaluating PEB interventions but warns of its limits in predicting real-world behavior. We call for refined synthetic modeling and sustained and extended human trials to align conversational AI's promise with tangible sustainability outcomes.</description>

      <title>Superscopes: Amplifying Internal Feature Representations for Language Model Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and interpreting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge. Patchscopes introduced a method for probing internal activations by patching them into new prompts, prompting models to self-explain their hidden representations. We introduce Superscopes, a technique that systematically amplifies superposed features in MLP outputs (multilayer perceptron) and hidden states before patching them into new contexts. Inspired by the "features as directions" perspective and the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) approach from diffusion models, Superscopes amplifies weak but meaningful features, enabling the interpretation of internal representations that previous methods failed to explain-all without requiring additional training. This approach provides new insights into how LLMs build context and represent complex concepts, further advancing mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Linear Representations of Political Perspective Emerge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, \texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.</description>

      <title>Correlation to Causation: A Causal Deep Learning Framework for Arctic Sea Ice Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques rely on correlation-based learning, often failing to distinguish spurious associations from true causal relationships, which limits robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a causality-driven deep learning framework that integrates Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ causal discovery algorithms with a hybrid deep learning architecture. Using 43 years (1979-2021) of daily and monthly Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) and ocean-atmospheric datasets, our approach identifies causally significant factors, prioritizes features with direct influence, reduces feature overhead, and improves computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that integrating causal features enhances the deep learning model's predictive accuracy and interpretability across multiple lead times. Beyond SIE prediction, the proposed framework offers a scalable solution for dynamic, high-dimensional systems, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Educational Analysts: Transforming Multimodal Data Traces into Actionable Reading Assessment Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading assessments are essential for enhancing students' comprehension, yet many EdTech applications focus mainly on outcome-based metrics, providing limited insights into student behavior and cognition. This study investigates the use of multimodal data sources -- including eye-tracking data, learning outcomes, assessment content, and teaching standards -- to derive meaningful reading insights. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct reading behavior patterns, and then a large language model (LLM) synthesizes the derived information into actionable reports for educators, streamlining the interpretation process. LLM experts and human educators evaluate these reports for clarity, accuracy, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness. Our findings indicate that LLMs can effectively function as educational analysts, turning diverse data into teacher-friendly insights that are well-received by educators. While promising for automating insight generation, human oversight remains crucial to ensure reliability and fairness. This research advances human-centered AI in education, connecting data-driven analytics with practical classroom applications.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of Task-Specific Prompts for In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-context learning capabilities of modern language models have motivated a deeper mathematical understanding of sequence models. A line of recent work has shown that linear attention models can emulate projected gradient descent iterations to implicitly learn the task vector from the data provided in the context window. In this work, we consider a novel setting where the global task distribution can be partitioned into a union of conditional task distributions. We then examine the use of task-specific prompts and prediction heads for learning the prior information associated with the conditional task distribution using a one-layer attention model. Our results on loss landscape show that task-specific prompts facilitate a covariance-mean decoupling where prompt-tuning explains the conditional mean of the distribution whereas the variance is learned/explained through in-context learning. Incorporating task-specific head further aids this process by entirely decoupling estimation of mean and variance components. This covariance-mean perspective similarly explains how jointly training prompt and attention weights can provably help over fine-tuning after pretraining.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularizing continual learning techniques is important for anticipating algorithmic behavior under new realizations of data. We introduce a new approach to continual learning by imposing the properties of a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) to regularize the expected behavior of the loss over time. This class of parabolic PDEs has a number of favorable properties that allow us to analyze the error incurred through forgetting and the error induced through generalization. Specifically, we do this through imposing boundary conditions where the boundary is given by a memory buffer. By using the memory buffer as a boundary, we can enforce long term dependencies by bounding the expected error by the boundary loss. Finally, we illustrate the empirical performance of the method on a series of continual learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Near Complete Nonasymptotic Generalization Theory For Multilayer Neural Networks: Beyond the Bias-Variance Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a first near complete (that will make explicit sense in the main text) nonasymptotic generalization theory for multilayer neural networks with arbitrary Lipschitz activations and general Lipschitz loss functions (with some very mild conditions). In particular, it doens't require the boundness of loss function, as commonly assumed in the literature. Our theory goes beyond the bias-variance tradeoff, aligned with phenomenon typically encountered in deep learning. It is therefore sharp different with other existing nonasymptotic generalization error bounds for neural networks. More explicitly, we propose an explicit generalization error upper bound for multilayer neural networks with arbitrary Lipschitz activations $\sigma$ with $\sigma(0)=0$ and broad enough Lipschitz loss functions, without requiring either the width, depth or other hyperparameters of the neural network approaching infinity, a specific neural network architect (e.g. sparsity, boundness of some norms), a particular activation function, a particular optimization algorithm or boundness of the loss function, and with taking the approximation error into consideration. General Lipschitz activation can also be accommodated into our framework. A feature of our theory is that it also considers approximation errors. Furthermore, we show the near minimax optimality of our theory for multilayer ReLU networks for regression problems. Notably, our upper bound exhibits the famous double descent phenomenon for such networks, which is the most distinguished characteristic compared with other existing results. This work emphasizes a view that many classical results should be improved to embrace the unintuitive characteristics of deep learning to get a better understanding of it.</description>

      <title>Forgetting Transformer: Softmax Attention with a Forget Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An essential component of modern recurrent sequence models is the forget gate. While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, we show that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. We name this attention mechanism the Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). We show that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. We also introduce a "Pro" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/forgetting-transformer.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Loss Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularizing neural networks is important for anticipating model behavior in regions of the data space that are not well represented. In this work, we propose a regularization technique for enforcing a level of smoothness in the mapping between the data input space and the loss value. We specify the level of regularity by requiring that the loss of the network satisfies an elliptic operator over the data domain. To do this, we modify the usual empirical risk minimization objective such that we instead minimize a new objective that satisfies an elliptic operator over points within the domain. This allows us to use existing theory on elliptic operators to anticipate the behavior of the error for points outside the training set. We propose a tractable computational method that approximates the behavior of the elliptic operator while being computationally efficient. Finally, we analyze the properties of the proposed regularization to understand the performance on common problems of distribution shift and group imbalance. Numerical experiments confirm the utility of the proposed regularization technique.</description>

      <title>AugFL: Augmenting Federated Learning with Pretrained Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has garnered widespread interest in recent years. However, owing to strict privacy policies or limited storage capacities of training participants such as IoT devices, its effective deployment is often impeded by the scarcity of training data in practical decentralized learning environments. In this paper, we study enhancing FL with the aid of (large) pre-trained models (PMs), that encapsulate wealthy general/domain-agnostic knowledge, to alleviate the data requirement in conducting FL from scratch. Specifically, we consider a networked FL system formed by a central server and distributed clients. First, we formulate the PM-aided personalized FL as a regularization-based federated meta-learning problem, where clients join forces to learn a meta-model with knowledge transferred from a private PM stored at the server. Then, we develop an inexact-ADMM-based algorithm, AugFL, to optimize the problem with no need to expose the PM or incur additional computational costs to local clients. Further, we establish theoretical guarantees for AugFL in terms of communication complexity, adaptation performance, and the benefit of knowledge transfer in general non-convex cases. Extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy and superiority of AugFL over existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi-based mobility monitoring in urban environments can provide valuable insights into pedestrian and vehicle movements. However, MAC address randomization introduces a significant obstacle in accurately estimating congestion levels and path trajectories. To this end, we consider radio frequency fingerprinting and re-identification for attributing WiFi traffic to emitting devices without the use of MAC addresses.
  We present MobRFFI, an AI-based device fingerprinting and re-identification framework for WiFi networks that leverages an encoder deep learning model to extract unique features based on WiFi chipset hardware impairments. It is entirely independent of frame type. When evaluated on the WiFi fingerprinting dataset WiSig, our approach achieves 94% and 100% device accuracy in multi-day and single-day re-identification scenarios, respectively.
  We also collect a novel dataset, MobRFFI, for granular multi-receiver WiFi device fingerprinting evaluation. Using the dataset, we demonstrate that the combination of fingerprints from multiple receivers boosts re-identification performance from 81% to 100% on a single-day scenario and from 41% to 100% on a multi-day scenario.</description>

      <title>MedHEval: Benchmarking Hallucinations and Mitigation Strategies in Medical Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are becoming increasingly important in the medical domain, yet Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) frequently generate hallucinations due to limited expertise and the complexity of medical applications. Existing benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate hallucinations based on their underlying causes and lack assessments of mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce MedHEval, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates hallucinations and mitigation strategies in Med-LVLMs by categorizing them into three underlying causes: visual misinterpretation, knowledge deficiency, and context misalignment. We construct a diverse set of close- and open-ended medical VQA datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess these hallucination types. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 popular (Med)-LVLMs and evaluate 7 state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation techniques. Results reveal that Med-LVLMs struggle with hallucinations arising from different causes while existing mitigation methods show limited effectiveness, especially for knowledge- and context-based errors. These findings underscore the need for improved alignment training and specialized mitigation strategies to enhance Med-LVLMs' reliability. MedHEval establishes a standardized framework for evaluating and mitigating medical hallucinations, guiding the development of more trustworthy Med-LVLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain shift remains a persistent challenge in deep-learning-based computer vision, often requiring extensive model modifications or large labeled datasets to address. Inspired by human visual perception, which adjusts input quality through corrective lenses rather than over-training the brain, we propose Lens, a novel camera sensor control method that enhances model performance by capturing high-quality images from the model's perspective rather than relying on traditional human-centric sensor control. Lens is lightweight and adapts sensor parameters to specific models and scenes in real-time. At its core, Lens utilizes VisiT, a training-free, model-specific quality indicator that evaluates individual unlabeled samples at test time using confidence scores without additional adaptation costs. To validate Lens, we introduce ImageNet-ES Diverse, a new benchmark dataset capturing natural perturbations from varying sensor and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments on both ImageNet-ES and our new ImageNet-ES Diverse show that Lens significantly improves model accuracy across various baseline schemes for sensor control and model modification while maintaining low latency in image captures. Lens effectively compensates for large model size differences and integrates synergistically with model improvement techniques. Our code and dataset are available at github.com/Edw2n/Lens.git.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current LLM pipelines account for only one possible tokenization for a given string, ignoring exponentially many alternative tokenizations during training and inference. For example, the standard Llama3 tokenization of penguin is [p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models.</description>

      <title>DivPrune: Diversity-based Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of understanding various data modalities, including text, images, and videos. LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/vbdi/divprune}{\text{here}}$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Differential Evolution Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Energy Saving Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem Considering Machine Multi States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the continuous deepening of low-carbon emission reduction policies, the manufacturing industries urgently need sensible energy-saving scheduling schemes to achieve the balance between improving production efficiency and reducing energy consumption. In energy-saving scheduling, reasonable machine states-switching is a key point to achieve expected goals, i.e., whether the machines need to switch speed between different operations, and whether the machines need to add extra setup time between different jobs. Regarding this matter, this work proposes a novel machine multi states-based energy saving flexible job scheduling problem (EFJSP-M), which simultaneously takes into account machine multi speeds and setup time. To address the proposed EFJSP-M, a kind of discrete differential evolution particle swarm optimization algorithm (D-DEPSO) is designed. In specific, D-DEPSO includes a hybrid initialization strategy to improve the initial population performance, an updating mechanism embedded with differential evolution operators to enhance population diversity, and a critical path variable neighborhood search strategy to expand the solution space. At last, based on datasets DPs and MKs, the experiment results compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the feasible of EFJSP-M and the superior of D-DEPSO.</description>

      <title>ATLaS: Agent Tuning via Learning Critical Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Words or Vision: Do Vision-Language Models Have Blind Faith in Text?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \emph{``blind faith in text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies.</description>

      <title>One Patient's Annotation is Another One's Initialization: Towards Zero-Shot Surgical Video Segmentation with Cross-Patient Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video object segmentation is an emerging technology that is well-suited for real-time surgical video segmentation, offering valuable clinical assistance in the operating room by ensuring consistent frame tracking. However, its adoption is limited by the need for manual intervention to select the tracked object, making it impractical in surgical settings. In this work, we tackle this challenge with an innovative solution: using previously annotated frames from other patients as the tracking frames. We find that this unconventional approach can match or even surpass the performance of using patients' own tracking frames, enabling more autonomous and efficient AI-assisted surgical workflows. Furthermore, we analyze the benefits and limitations of this approach, highlighting its potential to enhance segmentation accuracy while reducing the need for manual input. Our findings provide insights into key factors influencing performance, offering a foundation for future research on optimizing cross-patient frame selection for real-time surgical video analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Reliability via Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate due to misaligned self-awareness, generating erroneous outputs when addressing queries beyond their knowledge boundaries. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations via uncertainty estimation or query rejection, they suffer from computational inefficiency or sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate use of high-confidence outputs. For uncertain predictions, a slow refinement model conducts targeted reasoning to improve accuracy. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. Our work establishes a scalable paradigm for advancing LLM reliability and balancing accuracy and practical utility in error-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Natural Selector for Embodied Soft Robot Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing soft robots is a complex and iterative process that demands cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, mechanics, and control, often relying on intuition and extensive experimentation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to learn and apply embodied design principles--crucial for creating functional robotic systems--remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. We further demonstrate the practical utility of LLMs for robot design initialization. Our code and benchmark will be available to encourage the community to foster this exciting research direction.</description>

      <title>REAct: Rational Exponential Activation for Better Learning and Generalization in PINNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising approach to simulating physical systems. Still, their application is limited by optimization challenges, mainly due to the lack of activation functions that generalize well across several physical systems. Existing activation functions often lack such flexibility and generalization power. To address this issue, we introduce Rational Exponential Activation (REAct), a generalized form of tanh consisting of four learnable shape parameters. Experiments show that REAct outperforms many standard and benchmark activations, achieving an MSE three orders of magnitude lower than tanh on heat problems and generalizing well to finer grids and points beyond the training domain. It also excels at function approximation tasks and improves noise rejection in inverse problems, leading to more accurate parameter estimates across varying noise levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experience replay is a key component in reinforcement learning for stabilizing learning and improving sample efficiency. Its typical implementation samples transitions with replacement from a replay buffer. In contrast, in supervised learning with a fixed dataset, it is a common practice to shuffle the dataset every epoch and consume data sequentially, which is called random reshuffling (RR). RR enjoys theoretically better convergence properties and has been shown to outperform with-replacement sampling empirically. To leverage the benefits of RR in reinforcement learning, we propose sampling methods that extend RR to experience replay, both in uniform and prioritized settings. We evaluate our sampling methods on Atari benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Action Recognition with Audio Source Localization Guided Mixup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video action recognition is a challenging but important task for understanding and discovering what the video does. However, acquiring annotations for a video is costly, and semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been studied to improve performance even with a small number of labeled data in the task. Prior studies for semi-supervised video action recognition have mostly focused on using single modality - visuals - but the video is multi-modal, so utilizing both visuals and audio would be desirable and improve performance further, which has not been explored well. Therefore, we propose audio-visual SSL for video action recognition, which uses both visual and audio together, even with quite a few labeled data, which is challenging. In addition, to maximize the information of audio and video, we propose a novel audio source localization-guided mixup method that considers inter-modal relations between video and audio modalities. In experiments on UCF-51, Kinetics-400, and VGGSound datasets, our model shows the superior performance of the proposed semi-supervised audio-visual action recognition framework and audio source localization-guided mixup.</description>

      <title>Flexible Prefrontal Control over Hippocampal Episodic Memory for Goal-Directed Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.</description>

      <title>Target Return Optimizer for Multi-Game Decision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving autonomous agents with robust generalization capabilities across diverse games and tasks remains one of the ultimate goals in AI research. Recent advancements in transformer-based offline reinforcement learning, exemplified by the MultiGame Decision Transformer [Lee et al., 2022], have shown remarkable performance across various games or tasks. However, these approaches depend heavily on human expertise, presenting substantial challenges for practical deployment, particularly in scenarios with limited prior game-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Game Target Return Optimizer (MTRO) to autonomously determine game-specific target returns within the Multi-Game Decision Transformer framework using solely offline datasets. MTRO addresses the existing limitations by automating the target return configuration process, leveraging environmental reward information extracted from offline datasets. Notably, MTRO does not require additional training, enabling seamless integration into existing Multi-Game Decision Transformer architectures. Our experimental evaluations on Atari games demonstrate that MTRO enhances the performance of RL policies across a wide array of games, underscoring its potential to advance the field of autonomous agent development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%). Our findings stress the core of structured CoT training in advancing audio reasoning.</description>

      <title>PromptCoT: Synthesizing Olympiad-level Problems for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of large language models to solve complex mathematical problems has progressed significantly, particularly for tasks requiring advanced reasoning. However, the scarcity of sufficiently challenging problems, particularly at the Olympiad level, hinders further advancements. In this work, we introduce PromptCoT, a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality Olympiad-level math problems. The proposed method synthesizes complex problems based on mathematical concepts and the rationale behind problem construction, emulating the thought processes of experienced problem designers. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that an optimal rationale should maximize both the likelihood of rationale generation given the associated concepts and the likelihood of problem generation conditioned on both the rationale and the concepts. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, where it consistently outperforms existing problem generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PromptCoT exhibits superior data scalability, consistently maintaining high performance as the dataset size increases, outperforming the baselines. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/PromptCoT.</description>

      <title>Examining the Mental Health Impact of Misinformation on Social Media Using a Hybrid Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media has significantly reshaped interpersonal communication, fostering connectivity while also enabling the proliferation of misinformation. The unchecked spread of false narratives has profound effects on mental health, contributing to increased stress, anxiety, and misinformation-driven paranoia. This study presents a hybrid transformer-based approach using a RoBERTa-LSTM classifier to detect misinformation, assess its impact on mental health, and classify disorders linked to misinformation exposure. The proposed models demonstrate accuracy rates of 98.4, 87.8, and 77.3 in detecting misinformation, mental health implications, and disorder classification, respectively. Furthermore, Pearson's Chi-Squared Test for Independence (p-value = 0.003871) validates the direct correlation between misinformation and deteriorating mental well-being. This study underscores the urgent need for better misinformation management strategies to mitigate its psychological repercussions. Future research could explore broader datasets incorporating linguistic, demographic, and cultural variables to deepen the understanding of misinformation-induced mental health distress.</description>

      <title>BiasICL: In-Context Learning and Demographic Biases of Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, but their performance across demographic subgroups when using in-context learning (ICL) remains poorly understood. We examine how the demographic composition of demonstration examples affects VLM performance in two medical imaging tasks: skin lesion malignancy prediction and pneumothorax detection from chest radiographs. Our analysis reveals that ICL influences model predictions through multiple mechanisms: (1) ICL allows VLMs to learn subgroup-specific disease base rates from prompts and (2) ICL leads VLMs to make predictions that perform differently across demographic groups, even after controlling for subgroup-specific disease base rates. Our empirical results inform best-practices for prompting current VLMs (specifically examining demographic subgroup performance, and matching base rates of labels to target distribution at a bulk level and within subgroups), while also suggesting next steps for improving our theoretical understanding of these models.</description>

      <title>GRADEO: Towards Human-Like Evaluation for Text-to-Video Generation via Multi-Step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent great advances in video generation models have demonstrated their potential to produce high-quality videos, bringing challenges to effective evaluation. Unlike human evaluation, existing automated evaluation metrics lack high-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities for video, thus making them infeasible and unexplainable. To fill this gap, we curate GRADEO-Instruct, a multi-dimensional T2V evaluation instruction tuning dataset, including 3.3k videos from over 10 existing video generation models and multi-step reasoning assessments converted by 16k human annotations. We then introduce GRADEO, one of the first specifically designed video evaluation models, which grades AI-generated videos for explainable scores and assessments through multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that our method aligns better with human evaluations than existing methods. Furthermore, our benchmarking reveals that current video generation models struggle to produce content that aligns with human reasoning and complex real-world scenarios. The models, datasets, and codes will be released soon.</description>

      <title>CQ CNN: A Hybrid Classical Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Diffusion Generated and U Net Segmented 3D MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) from clinical MRI data is an active area of research in medical imaging. Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with classical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop models that may outperform traditional methods. However, quantum machine learning (QML) remains in its early stages and requires further experimental analysis to better understand its behavior and limitations. In this paper, we propose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ CNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach involves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine learning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net), and training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority class. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3 qubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA) models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. In particular, the architecture employs only 13K parameters (0.48 MB), reducing the parameter count by more than 99.99% compared to current SOTA models. Furthermore, the diffusion-generated data used to train our quantum models, in conjunction with real samples, preserve clinical structural standards, representing a notable first in the field of QML. We conclude that CQCNN architecture like models, with further improvements in gradient optimization techniques, could become a viable option and even a potential alternative to classical models for AD detection, especially in data limited and resource constrained clinical settings.</description>

      <title>MindSimulator: Exploring Brain Concept Localization via Synthetic FMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept-selective regions within the human cerebral cortex exhibit significant activation in response to specific visual stimuli associated with particular concepts. Precisely localizing these regions stands as a crucial long-term goal in neuroscience to grasp essential brain functions and mechanisms. Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns. Using the synthetic recordings, we successfully localize several well-studied concept-selective regions and validate them against empirical findings, achieving promising prediction accuracy. The feasibility opens avenues for exploring novel concept-selective regions and provides prior hypotheses for future neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>CoServe: Efficient Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) Model Inference with Limited Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4 are resource-intensive, but recent advancements suggest that smaller, specialized experts can outperform the monolithic models on specific tasks. The Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) approach integrates multiple expert models, improving the accuracy of generated results and offering great potential for precision-critical applications, such as automatic circuit board quality inspection. However, deploying CoE serving systems presents challenges to memory capacity due to the large number of experts required, which can lead to significant performance overhead from frequent expert switching across different memory and storage tiers.
  We propose CoServe, an efficient CoE model serving system on heterogeneous CPU and GPU with limited memory. CoServe reduces unnecessary expert switching by leveraging expert dependency, a key property of CoE inference. CoServe introduces a dependency-aware request scheduler and dependency-aware expert management for efficient inference. It also introduces an offline profiler to automatically find optimal resource allocation on various processors and devices. In real-world intelligent manufacturing workloads, CoServe achieves 4.5$\times$ to 12$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>Are Large Vision Language Models Good Game Players?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding and reasoning about both visual and textual information. However, existing evaluation methods for LVLMs, primarily based on benchmarks like Visual Question Answering and image captioning, often fail to capture the full scope of LVLMs' capabilities. These benchmarks are limited by issues such as inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of focus on multi-turn reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose \method{}, a game-based evaluation framework designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. \method{} uses a set of games to evaluate LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, with each target task designed to assess specific abilities, including visual perception, reasoning, decision-making, etc. Based on this framework, we conduct extensive experiments that explore the limitations of current LVLMs, such as handling long structured outputs and perceiving detailed and dense elements. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/xinke-wang/LVLM-Playground.</description>

      <title>BdSLW401: Transformer-Based Word-Level Bangla Sign Language Recognition Using Relative Quantization Encoding (RQE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) for low-resource languages like Bangla suffers from signer variability, viewpoint variations, and limited annotated datasets. In this paper, we present BdSLW401, a large-scale, multi-view, word-level Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) dataset with 401 signs and 102,176 video samples from 18 signers in front and lateral views. To improve transformer-based SLR, we introduce Relative Quantization Encoding (RQE), a structured embedding approach anchoring landmarks to physiological reference points and quantize motion trajectories. RQE improves attention allocation by decreasing spatial variability, resulting in 44.3% WER reduction in WLASL100, 21.0% in SignBD-200, and significant gains in BdSLW60 and SignBD-90. However, fixed quantization becomes insufficient on large-scale datasets (e.g., WLASL2000), indicating the need for adaptive encoding strategies. Further, RQE-SF, an extended variant that stabilizes shoulder landmarks, achieves improvements in pose consistency at the cost of small trade-offs in lateral view recognition. The attention graphs prove that RQE improves model interpretability by focusing on the major articulatory features (fingers, wrists) and the more distinctive frames instead of global pose changes. Introducing BdSLW401 and demonstrating the effectiveness of RQE-enhanced structured embeddings, this work advances transformer-based SLR for low-resource languages and sets a benchmark for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Iterative Value Function Optimization for Guided Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant method for controlling language model outputs, it suffers from high computational costs and training instability. Guided decoding, especially value-guided methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by controlling outputs without re-training models. However, the accuracy of the value function is crucial for value-guided decoding, as inaccuracies can lead to suboptimal decision-making and degraded performance. Existing methods struggle with accurately estimating the optimal value function, leading to less effective control. We propose Iterative Value Function Optimization, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: Monte Carlo Value Estimation, which reduces estimation variance by exploring diverse trajectories, and Iterative On-Policy Optimization, which progressively improves value estimation through collecting trajectories from value-guided policies. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of value-guided decoding approaches in aligning language models. These approaches not only achieve alignment but also significantly reduce computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.</description>

      <title>JPDS-NN: Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Task Allocation for Agricultural Vehicle Routing Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Entrance Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (EDVRP) is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the scale of cities influences routing outcomes, necessitating consideration of their entrances. This paper addresses EDVRP in agriculture, focusing on multi-parameter vehicle planning for irregularly shaped fields. To address the limitations of traditional methods, such as heuristic approaches, which often overlook field geometry and entrance constraints, we propose a Joint Probability Distribution Sampling Neural Network (JPDS-NN) to effectively solve the EDVRP. The network uses an encoder-decoder architecture with graph transformers and attention mechanisms to model routing as a Markov Decision Process, and is trained via reinforcement learning for efficient and rapid end-to-end planning. Experimental results indicate that JPDS-NN reduces travel distances by 48.4-65.4%, lowers fuel consumption by 14.0-17.6%, and computes two orders of magnitude faster than baseline methods, while demonstrating 15-25% superior performance in dynamic arrangement scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of cross-attention and pre-training. The framework enables scalable, intelligent routing for large-scale farming under dynamic constraints.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Precise Training Data Construction Framework for Process-supervised Reward Model in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is of great scientific and practical significance. Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM, which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps. Compared to other publicly available datasets, the PRM trained on Epic50k demonstrates significantly superior performance. Getting Epic50k at https://github.com/xiaolizh1/EpicPRM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social networks have a vast range of applications with graphs. The available benchmark datasets are citation, co-occurrence, e-commerce networks, etc, with classes ranging from 3 to 15. However, there is no benchmark classification social network dataset for graph machine learning. This paper fills the gap and presents the Binary Classification Social Network Dataset (\textit{BiSND}), designed for graph machine learning applications to predict binary classes. We present the BiSND in \textit{tabular and graph} formats to verify its robustness across classical and advanced machine learning. We employ a diverse set of classifiers, including four traditional machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, XGBoost), one Deep Neural Network (multi-layer perceptrons), one Graph Neural Network (Graph Convolutional Network), and three state-of-the-art Graph Contrastive Learning methods (BGRL, GRACE, DAENS). Our findings reveal that BiSND is suitable for classification tasks, with F1-scores ranging from 67.66 to 70.15, indicating promising avenues for future enhancements.</description>

However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.</description>

      <title>VisAgent: Narrative-Preserving Story Visualization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Story visualization is the transformation of narrative elements into image sequences. While existing research has primarily focused on visual contextual coherence, the deeper narrative essence of stories often remains overlooked. This limitation hinders the practical application of these approaches, as generated images frequently fail to capture the intended meaning and nuances of the narrative fully. To address these challenges, we propose VisAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework designed to comprehend and visualize pivotal scenes within a given story. By considering story distillation, semantic consistency, and contextual coherence, VisAgent employs an agentic workflow. In this workflow, multiple specialized agents collaborate to: (i) refine layered prompts based on the narrative structure and (ii) seamlessly integrate \gt{generated} elements, including refined prompts, scene elements, and subject placement, into the final image. The empirically validated effectiveness confirms the framework's suitability for practical story visualization applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based weed control systems often suffer from limited training data diversity and constrained on-board computation, impacting their real-world performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework that leverages Stable Diffusion-based inpainting to augment training data progressively in 10% increments -- up to an additional 200%, thus enhancing both the volume and diversity of samples. Our approach is evaluated on two state-of-the-art object detection models, YOLO11(l) and RT-DETR(l), using the mAP50 metric to assess detection performance. We explore quantization strategies (FP16 and INT8) for both the generative inpainting and detection models to strike a balance between inference speed and accuracy. Deployment of the downstream models on the Jetson Orin Nano demonstrates the practical viability of our framework in resource-constrained environments, ultimately improving detection accuracy and computational efficiency in intelligent weed management systems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Meets Dense: Unified Generative Recommendations with Cascaded Sparse-Dense Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have recently gained attention in recommendation systems by directly predicting item identifiers from user interaction sequences. However, existing methods suffer from significant information loss due to the separation of stages such as quantization and sequence modeling, hindering their ability to achieve the modeling precision and accuracy of sequential dense retrieval techniques. Integrating generative and dense retrieval methods remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce the Cascaded Organized Bi-Represented generAtive retrieval (COBRA) framework, which innovatively integrates sparse semantic IDs and dense vectors through a cascading process. Our method alternates between generating these representations by first generating sparse IDs, which serve as conditions to aid in the generation of dense vectors. End-to-end training enables dynamic refinement of dense representations, capturing both semantic insights and collaborative signals from user-item interactions. During inference, COBRA employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, starting with sparse ID generation and refining them into dense vectors via the generative model. We further propose BeamFusion, an innovative approach combining beam search with nearest neighbor scores to enhance inference flexibility and recommendation diversity. Extensive experiments on public datasets and offline tests validate our method's robustness. Online A/B tests on a real-world advertising platform with over 200 million daily users demonstrate substantial improvements in key metrics, highlighting COBRA's practical advantages.</description>

      <title>BioD2C: A Dual-level Semantic Consistency Constraint Framework for Biomedical VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical visual question answering (VQA) has been widely studied and has demonstrated significant application value and potential in fields such as assistive medical diagnosis. Despite their success, current biomedical VQA models perform multimodal information interaction only at the model level within large language models (LLMs), leading to suboptimal multimodal semantic alignment when dealing with complex tasks. To address this issue, we propose BioD2C: a novel Dual-level Semantic Consistency Constraint Framework for Biomedical VQA, which achieves dual-level semantic interaction alignment at both the model and feature levels, enabling the model to adaptively learn visual features based on the question. Specifically, we firstly integrate textual features into visual features via an image-text fusion mechanism as feature-level semantic interaction, obtaining visual features conditioned on the given text; and then introduce a text-queue-based cross-modal soft semantic loss function to further align the image semantics with the question semantics. Specifically, in this work, we establish a new dataset, BioVGQ, to address inherent biases in prior datasets by filtering manually-altered images and aligning question-answer pairs with multimodal context, and train our model on this dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BioD2C achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple downstream datasets, showcasing its robustness, generalizability, and potential to advance biomedical VQA research.</description>

      <title>ERetinex: Event Camera Meets Retinex Theory for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to restore the under-exposure image captured in dark scenarios. Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</description>

      <title>Union of Experts: Adapting Hierarchical Routing to Equivalently Decomposed Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhances model performance while maintaining computational efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. However, expert in exist MoE paradigm works as an individual, thereby lacking high-quality expert interactions. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention block, which constrains further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes transformer into an equitant group of experts, and then implement dynamic routing on input data and experts. Our approach advances MoE design with three key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the model employed with UoE surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains.

      <description>arXiv:2503.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for verifying Memoryful Neural Multi-Agent Systems (MN-MAS) against full Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. In MN-MAS, agents interact with a non-deterministic, partially observable environment. Examples of MN-MAS include multi-agent systems based on feed-forward and recurrent neural networks or state-space models. Different from previous approaches, we support the verification of both bounded and unbounded LTL specifications. We leverage well-established bounded model checking techniques, including lasso search and invariant synthesis, to reduce the verification problem to that of constraint solving. To solve these constraints, we develop efficient methods based on bound propagation, mixed-integer linear programming, and adaptive splitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms in single and multi-agent environments from the Gymnasium and PettingZoo libraries, verifying unbounded specifications for the first time and improving the verification time for bounded specifications by an order of magnitude compared to the SoA.</description>

      <title>RectifiedHR: Enable Efficient High-Resolution Image Generation via Energy Rectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable advances in various image generation tasks. However, their performance notably declines when generating images at resolutions higher than those used during the training period. Despite the existence of numerous methods for producing high-resolution images, they either suffer from inefficiency or are hindered by complex operations. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, an efficient and straightforward solution for training-free high-resolution image generation. Specifically, we introduce the noise refresh strategy, which theoretically only requires a few lines of code to unlock the model's high-resolution generation ability and improve efficiency. Additionally, we first observe the phenomenon of energy decay that may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution image generation process. To address this issue, we propose an Energy Rectification strategy, where modifying the hyperparameters of the classifier-free guidance effectively improves the generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and boasts a simple implementation logic. Through extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods, our RectifiedHR demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Federated nnU-Net for Privacy-Preserving Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation and has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting different diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the data collected from hospitals are stored in one center and used to train the nnU-Net. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning is one of the approaches to train a segmentation model in a decentralized manner that helps preserve patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a federated learning extension of nnU-Net. We introduce two novel federated learning methods to the nnU-Net framework - Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg) - and experimentally show their consistent performance for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation using 6 datasets representing samples from 18 institutions. Additionally, to further promote research and deployment of decentralized training in privacy constrained institutions, we make our plug-n-play framework public.

      <title>World Models for Anomaly Detection during Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based controllers are often purposefully kept out of real-world applications due to concerns about their safety and reliability. We explore how state-of-the-art world models in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning can be utilized beyond the training phase to ensure a deployed policy only operates within regions of the state-space it is sufficiently familiar with. This is achieved by continuously monitoring discrepancies between a world model's predictions and observed system behavior during inference. It allows for triggering appropriate measures, such as an emergency stop, once an error threshold is surpassed. This does not require any task-specific knowledge and is thus universally applicable. Simulated experiments on established robot control tasks show the effectiveness of this method, recognizing changes in local robot geometry and global gravitational magnitude. Real-world experiments using an agile quadcopter further demonstrate the benefits of this approach by detecting unexpected forces acting on the vehicle. These results indicate how even in new and adverse conditions, safe and reliable operation of otherwise unpredictable learning-based controllers can be achieved.</description>

      <title>RaceVLA: VLA-based Racing Drone Navigation with Human-like Behaviour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RaceVLA presents an innovative approach for autonomous racing drone navigation by leveraging Visual-Language-Action (VLA) to emulate human-like behavior. This research explores the integration of advanced algorithms that enable drones to adapt their navigation strategies based on real-time environmental feedback, mimicking the decision-making processes of human pilots. The model, fine-tuned on a collected racing drone dataset, demonstrates strong generalization despite the complexity of drone racing environments. RaceVLA outperforms OpenVLA in motion (75.0 vs 60.0) and semantic generalization (45.5 vs 36.3), benefiting from the dynamic camera and simplified motion tasks. However, visual (79.6 vs 87.0) and physical (50.0 vs 76.7) generalization were slightly reduced due to the challenges of maneuvering in dynamic environments with varying object sizes. RaceVLA also outperforms RT-2 across all axes - visual (79.6 vs 52.0), motion (75.0 vs 55.0), physical (50.0 vs 26.7), and semantic (45.5 vs 38.8), demonstrating its robustness for real-time adjustments in complex environments. Experiments revealed an average velocity of 1.04 m/s, with a maximum speed of 2.02 m/s, and consistent maneuverability, demonstrating RaceVLA's ability to handle high-speed scenarios effectively. These findings highlight the potential of RaceVLA for high-performance navigation in competitive racing contexts.

      <description>arXiv:2503.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that current safety alignment research efforts for large language models are hindered by many intertwined sources of noise, such as small datasets, methodological inconsistencies, and unreliable evaluation setups. This can, at times, make it impossible to evaluate and compare attacks and defenses fairly, thereby slowing progress. We systematically analyze the LLM safety evaluation pipeline, covering dataset curation, optimization strategies for automated red-teaming, response generation, and response evaluation using LLM judges. At each stage, we identify key issues and highlight their practical impact. We also propose a set of guidelines for reducing noise and bias in evaluations of future attack and defense papers. Lastly, we offer an opposing perspective, highlighting practical reasons for existing limitations. We believe that addressing the outlined problems in future research will improve the field's ability to generate easily comparable results and make measurable progress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce StageDesigner, the first comprehensive framework for artistic stage generation using large language models combined with layout-controlled diffusion models. Given the professional requirements of stage scenography, StageDesigner simulates the workflows of seasoned artists to generate immersive 3D stage scenes. Specifically, our approach is divided into three primary modules: Script Analysis, which extracts thematic and spatial cues from input scripts; Foreground Generation, which constructs and arranges essential 3D objects; and Background Generation, which produces a harmonious background aligned with the narrative atmosphere and maintains spatial coherence by managing occlusions between foreground and background elements. Furthermore, we introduce the StagePro-V1 dataset, a dedicated dataset with 276 unique stage scenes spanning different historical styles and annotated with scripts, images, and detailed 3D layouts, specifically tailored for this task. Finally, evaluations using both standard and newly proposed metrics, along with extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of StageDesigner.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in perceiving and reasoning over multimodal inquiries, ushering in a new research era for foundation models. However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Threat Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some game scenarios, due to the uncertainty of the number of enemy units and the priority of various attributes, the evaluation of the threat level of enemy units as well as the screening has been a challenging research topic, and the core difficulty lies in how to reasonably set the priority of different attributes in order to achieve quantitative evaluation of the threat. In this paper, we innovatively transform the problem of threat assessment into a reinforcement learning problem, and through systematic reinforcement learning training, we successfully construct an efficient neural network evaluator. The evaluator can not only comprehensively integrate the multidimensional attribute features of the enemy, but also effectively combine our state information, thus realizing a more accurate and scientific threat assessment.</description>

      <title>Rewarding Doubt: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Confidence Calibration of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for LLM calibration that fine-tunes LLMs to elicit calibrated confidence estimations in their answers to factual questions. We model the problem as a betting game where the model predicts a confidence score together with every answer, and design a reward function that penalizes both over and under-confidence. We prove that under our reward design an optimal policy would result in a perfectly calibrated confidence estimation. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved confidence calibration and generalization to new tasks without re-training, indicating that our approach teaches a general confidence awareness. This approach enables the training of inherently calibrated LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Event Extraction with Massive Types: LLM-based Collaborative Annotation and Partitioning Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a general-purpose extraction system that can extract events with massive types is a long-standing target in Event Extraction (EE). In doing so, the challenge comes from two aspects: 1) The absence of an efficient and effective annotation method. 2) The absence of a powerful extraction method can handle massive types. For the first challenge, we propose a collaborative annotation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through collaboration among multiple LLMs, it first refines annotations of trigger words from distant supervision and then carries out argument annotation. Next, a voting phase consolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we create the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000 samples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we propose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE. To overcome the limited context length of LLMs, LLM-PEE first recalls candidate event types and then splits them into multiple partitions for LLMs to extract events. The results in the supervised setting show that LLM-PEE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 5.4 in event detection and 6.1 in argument extraction. In the zero-shot setting, LLM-PEE achieves up to 12.9 improvement compared to mainstream LLMs, demonstrating its strong generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Reflection on Data Storytelling Tools in the Generative AI Era from the Human-AI Collaboration Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-AI collaborative tools attract attentions from the data storytelling community to lower the barrier of expertise and streamline the workflow. The recent advance in large-scale generative AI techniques, e.g., large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image models, has the potential to enhance data storytelling with their power in visual and narration generation. After two years since these techniques were publicly available, it is important to reflect our progress of applying them and have an outlook for future opportunities. To achieve the goal, we compare the collaboration patterns of the latest tools with those of earlier ones using a dedicated framework for understanding human-AI collaboration in data storytelling. Through comparison, we identify persistent collaboration patterns, e.g., human-creator + AI-assistant, and emerging ones, e.g., AI-creator + human-reviewer. The benefits of these AI techniques and other implications to human-AI collaboration are also revealed. We further propose future directions to hopefully ignite innovations.</description>

      <title>YARE-GAN: Yet Another Resting State EEG-GAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in synthesising realistic neural data, yet their potential for unsupervised representation learning in resting-state EEG remains under explored. In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesised signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be fine-tuned for age group classification, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A dataset-free approach for self-supervised learning of 3D reflectional symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a self-supervised model that learns to detect the symmetry of a single object without requiring a dataset-relying solely on the input object itself. We hypothesize that the symmetry of an object can be determined by its intrinsic features, eliminating the need for large datasets during training. Additionally, we design a self-supervised learning strategy that removes the necessity of ground truth labels. These two key elements make our approach both effective and efficient, addressing the prohibitive costs associated with constructing large, labeled datasets for this task. The novelty of our method lies in computing features for each point on the object based on the idea that symmetric points should exhibit similar visual appearances. To achieve this, we leverage features extracted from a foundational image model to compute a visual descriptor for the points. This approach equips the point cloud with visual features that facilitate the optimization of our self-supervised model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art models trained on large datasets. Furthermore, our model is more efficient, effective, and operates with minimal computational and data resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent tremendous advancements in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) have also resulted into corresponding remarkable progress in the field of Computer Vision (CV), showcasing robust technological solutions in a wide range of application sectors of high industrial interest (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, automation, etc.). Despite the outstanding performance of CV systems in specific domains, their development and exploitation at industrial-scale necessitates, among other, the addressing of requirements related to the reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, safety, and robustness of the developed AI models. The latter raises the imperative need for the development of efficient, comprehensive and widely-adopted industrial standards. In this context, this study investigates the current state of play regarding the development of industrial computer vision AI standards, emphasizing on critical aspects, like model interpretability, data quality, and regulatory compliance. In particular, a systematic analysis of launched and currently developing CV standards, proposed by the main international standardization bodies (e.g. ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, etc.) is performed. The latter is complemented by a comprehensive discussion on the current challenges and future directions observed in this regularization endeavor.</description>

      <title>MPO: Boosting LLM Agents with Meta Plan Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Class-Aware PillarMix: Can Mixed Sample Data Augmentation Enhance 3D Object Detection with Radar Point Clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.</description>

      <title>Memory Efficient Continual Learning for Edge-Based Visual Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a critical task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. However, deploying these models on edge devices presents significant challenges, such as constrained computational and memory resources. Additionally, dynamic data distributions in real-world settings necessitate continuous model adaptation, further complicating deployment under limited resources. To address these challenges, we present a novel investigation into the problem of Continual Learning for Visual Anomaly Detection (CLAD) on edge devices. We evaluate the STFPM approach, given its low memory footprint on edge devices, which demonstrates good performance when combined with the Replay approach. Furthermore, we propose to study the behavior of a recently proposed approach, PaSTe, specifically designed for the edge but not yet explored in the Continual Learning context. Our results show that PaSTe is not only a lighter version of STPFM, but it also achieves superior anomaly detection performance, improving the f1 pixel performance by 10% with the Replay technique. In particular, the structure of PaSTe allows us to test it using a series of Compressed Replay techniques, reducing memory overhead by a maximum of 91.5% compared to the traditional Replay for STFPM. Our study proves the feasibility of deploying VAD models that adapt and learn incrementally on CLAD scenarios on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Generative Tools for Graphical Assets: Empirical Guidelines based on Game Designers' and Developers' Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical assets play an important role in the design and development of games. There is potential in the use of generative tools, to aid in creating graphical assets, thus improving game design and development pipelines. However, there is little research to address how the generative methods can fit into the wider pipeline. We conducted a user study with 16 game designers and developers to examine their preferences regarding generative tools for graphical assets. The findings highlight that early design stage is preferred by all participants (mean values above 0.67 and p &lt; .001 for early stages). Designers and developers prefer to use such tools for creating large amounts of variations at the cost of quality as they can improve the quality of the artefacts once they generate a suitable asset (mean value 0.17 where 1 is high quality, p &lt; .001). They also strongly (mean value .78, p &lt; .001) raised the need for better integration of such tools in existing design and development environments and the need for the outputs to be in common data formats, to be manipulatable and integrate smoothly into existing environments (mean 3.5 out of 5, p = .004). The study also highlights the requirement for further emphasis on the needs of the users to incorporate these tools effectively in existing pipelines. Informed by these results, we provide a set of guidelines for creating tools that meet the expectations and needs of game designers and developers.</description>

      <title>Vibration-Assisted Hysteresis Mitigation for Achieving High Compensation Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tendon-sheath mechanisms (TSMs) are widely used in minimally invasive surgical (MIS) applications, but their inherent hysteresis-caused by friction, backlash, and tendon elongation-leads to significant tracking errors. Conventional modeling and compensation methods struggle with these nonlinearities and require extensive parameter tuning. To address this, we propose a vibration-assisted hysteresis compensation approach, where controlled vibrational motion is applied along the tendon's movement direction to mitigate friction and reduce dead zones. Experimental results demonstrate that the exerted vibration consistently reduces hysteresis across all tested frequencies, decreasing RMSE by up to 23.41% (from 2.2345 mm to 1.7113 mm) and improving correlation, leading to more accurate trajectory tracking. When combined with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based compensation model, vibration further enhances performance, achieving an 85.2% reduction in MAE (from 1.334 mm to 0.1969 mm). Without vibration, the TCN-based approach still reduces MAE by 72.3% (from 1.334 mm to 0.370 mm) under the same parameter settings. These findings confirm that vibration effectively mitigates hysteresis, improving trajectory accuracy and enabling more efficient compensation models with fewer trainable parameters. This approach provides a scalable and practical solution for TSM-based robotic applications, particularly in MIS.</description>

      <title>UAR-NVC: A Unified AutoRegressive Framework for Memory-Efficient Neural Video Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have demonstrated significant potential in video compression by representing videos as neural networks. However, as the number of frames increases, the memory consumption for training and inference increases substantially, posing challenges in resource-constrained scenarios. Inspired by the success of traditional video compression frameworks, which process video frame by frame and can efficiently compress long videos, we adopt this modeling strategy for INRs to decrease memory consumption, while aiming to unify the frameworks from the perspective of timeline-based autoregressive modeling. In this work, we present a novel understanding of INR models from an autoregressive (AR) perspective and introduce a Unified AutoRegressive Framework for memory-efficient Neural Video Compression (UAR-NVC). UAR-NVC integrates timeline-based and INR-based neural video compression under a unified autoregressive paradigm. It partitions videos into several clips and processes each clip using a different INR model instance, leveraging the advantages of both compression frameworks while allowing seamless adaptation to either in form. To further reduce temporal redundancy between clips, we design two modules to optimize the initialization, training, and compression of these model parameters. UAR-NVC supports adjustable latencies by varying the clip length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UAR-NVC, with its flexible video clip setting, can adapt to resource-constrained environments and significantly improve performance compared to different baseline models.</description>

Abstract: Accurate simulations of oil spill trajectories are essential for supporting practitioners' response and mitigating environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias in LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the implement of guardrails by developers, Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in explicit bias tests. However, bias in LLMs may occur not only explicitly, but also implicitly, much like humans who consciously strive for impartiality yet still harbor implicit bias. The unconscious and automatic nature of implicit bias makes it particularly challenging to study. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing key concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology, extending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and decision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias into two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based metrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the broad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in LLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on future challenges. We aim for this work to serve as a clear guide for researchers and inspire innovative ideas to advance exploration in this task.</description>

      <title>IterPref: Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from
  candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Licenses You See -- Dataset Compliance Requires Massive-Scale AI-Powered Lifecycle Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.</description>

      <title>A Causal Framework for Aligning Image Quality Metrics and Deep Neural Network Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image quality plays an important role in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) and DNNs have been widely shown to exhibit sensitivity to changes in imaging conditions. Large-scale datasets often contain images under a wide range of conditions prompting a need to quantify and understand their underlying quality distribution in order to better characterize DNN performance and robustness. Aligning the sensitivities of image quality metrics and DNNs ensures that estimates of quality can act as proxies for image/dataset difficulty independent of the task models trained/evaluated on the data. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but here we seek a quality measure that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. In order to answer this question, we reframe IQA from a causal perspective and examine conditions under which quality metrics are predictive of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that current IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance in the context of classification. We then use our causal framework to provide an alternative formulation and a new image quality metric that is more strongly correlated with DNN performance and can act as a prior on performance without training new task models. Our approach provides a means to directly estimate the quality distribution of large-scale image datasets towards characterizing the relationship between dataset composition and DNN performance.</description>

      <title>Q-Filters: Leveraging QK Geometry for Efficient KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives, Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups. Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task with a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by up to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Symphony: Integrating Taste and Sound through Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, neuroscientific and psychological research has traced direct relationships between taste and auditory perceptions. This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI. We release our dataset, code and pre-trained model at: https://osf.io/xs5jy/.</description>

      <title>Developing a PET/CT Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Anatomical and Functional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In oncology, Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is widely used in cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring, as it combines anatomical details from CT with functional metabolic activity and molecular marker expression information from PET. However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</description>

      <title>AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</description>

      <title>SeqFusion: Sequential Fusion of Pre-Trained Models for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional time-series forecasting methods that require extensive in-task data for training, zero-shot forecasting can directly predict future values given a target time series without additional training data. Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for Subtype Classification in Breast Cancer Using Histopathological Images and Gene Expression Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular subtyping of breast cancer is crucial for personalized treatment and prognosis. Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>(How) Do Language Models Track State?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</description>

      <title>Deepfake-Eval-2024: A Multi-Modal In-the-Wild Benchmark of Deepfakes Circulated in 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of increasingly realistic generative AI, robust deepfake detection is essential for mitigating fraud and disinformation. While many deepfake detectors report high accuracy on academic datasets, we show that these academic benchmarks are out of date and not representative of recent deepfakes. We introduce Deepfake-Eval-2024, a new deepfake detection benchmark consisting of in-the-wild deepfakes collected from social media and deepfake detection platform users in 2024. Deepfake-Eval-2024 consists of 44 hours of videos, 56.5 hours of audio, and 1,975 images, encompassing the latest manipulation technologies. The benchmark contains diverse media content from 88 different websites in 52 different languages. We find that the performance of open-source state-of-the-art deepfake detection models drops precipitously when evaluated on Deepfake-Eval-2024, with AUC decreasing by 50% for video, 48% for audio, and 45% for image models compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate commercial deepfake detection models and models finetuned on Deepfake-Eval-2024, and find that they have superior performance to off-the-shelf open-source models, but they do not yet reach the accuracy of human deepfake forensic analysts. The dataset is available at https://github.com/nuriachandra/Deepfake-Eval-2024.</description>

Abstract: Collecting ground truth task completion rewards or human demonstrations for multi-step reasoning tasks is often cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, especially in interactive domains like web tasks. To address this bottleneck, we present self-taught lookahead, a self-supervised method that leverages state-transition dynamics to train a value model capable of effectively guiding language model-controlled search. We find that moderately sized (8 billion parameters) open-weight value models improved with self-taught lookahead can match the performance of using a frontier LLM such as gpt-4o as the value model. Furthermore, we find that self-taught lookahead improves performance by 20% while reducing costs 37x compared to previous LLM-based tree search, without relying on ground truth rewards.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Wikipedia, examining the evolution of Wikipedia through existing data and using simulations to explore potential risks. We begin by analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks.</description>

      <title>Reactive Diffusion Policy: Slow-Fast Visual-Tactile Policy Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can accomplish complex contact-rich tasks using vision and touch, with highly reactive capabilities such as quick adjustments to environmental changes and adaptive control of contact forces; however, this remains challenging for robots. Existing visual imitation learning (IL) approaches rely on action chunking to model complex behaviors, which lacks the ability to respond instantly to real-time tactile feedback during the chunk execution. Furthermore, most teleoperation systems struggle to provide fine-grained tactile / force feedback, which limits the range of tasks that can be performed. To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost teleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented Reality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast visual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich manipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent diffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low frequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback control at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling and quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive evaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines through rapid response to tactile / force feedback. Furthermore, experiments show that RDP is applicable across different tactile / force sensors. Code and videos are available on https://reactive-diffusion-policy.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method combined with dedicated heuristics for solving the Weighted Vertex Coloring Problem. In addition to the basic MCTS algorithm, we study several MCTS variants where the conventional random simulation is replaced by other simulation strategies including greedy and local search heuristics. We conduct experiments on well-known benchmark instances to assess these combined MCTS variants. We provide empirical evidence to shed light on the advantages and limits of each simulation strategy. This is an extension of the work of Grelier and al. presented at EvoCOP2022.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Framework for Learning Argumentation Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Argumentation is a very active research field of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the representation and evaluation of arguments used in dialogues between humans and/or artificial agents. Acceptability semantics of formal argumentation systems define the criteria for the acceptance or rejection of arguments. Several software systems, known as argumentation solvers, have been developed to compute the accepted/rejected arguments using such criteria. These include systems that learn to identify the accepted arguments using non-interpretable methods. In this paper we present a novel framework, which uses an Inductive Logic Programming approach to learn the acceptability semantics for several abstract and structured argumentation frameworks in an interpretable way. Through an empirical evaluation we show that our framework outperforms existing argumentation solvers, thus opening up new future research directions in the area of formal argumentation and human-machine dialogues.</description>

      <title>Lean-STaR: Learning to Interleave Thinking and Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR achieves state-of-the-art results on the miniF2F-test benchmark within the Lean theorem proving environment, significantly outperforming base models ($\boldsymbol{43.4\% \rightarrow 46.3\%,}$ Pass@64). We also analyze the impact of the augmented thoughts on various aspects of the theorem proving process, providing insights into their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-)Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce miniCTX, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. miniCTX contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for miniCTX, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as miniF2F. Alongside miniCTX, we offer ntp-toolkit for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into miniCTX to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. miniCTX offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers.</description>

      <title>Advancing Molecular Graph-Text Pre-training via Fine-grained Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding molecular structure and related knowledge is crucial for scientific research. Recent studies integrate molecular graphs with their textual descriptions to enhance molecular representation learning. However, they focus on the whole molecular graph and neglect frequently occurring subgraphs, known as motifs, which are essential for determining molecular properties. Without such fine-grained knowledge, these models struggle to generalize to unseen molecules and tasks that require motif-level insights. To bridge this gap, we propose FineMolTex, a novel Fine-grained Molecular graph-Text pre-training framework to jointly learn coarse-grained molecule-level knowledge and fine-grained motif-level knowledge. Specifically, FineMolTex consists of two pre-training tasks: a contrastive alignment task for coarse-grained matching and a masked multi-modal modeling task for fine-grained matching. In particular, the latter predicts the labels of masked motifs and words, which are selected based on their importance. By leveraging insights from both modalities, FineMolTex is able to understand the fine-grained matching between motifs and words. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across three downstream tasks, achieving up to 238% improvement in the text-based molecule editing task. Additionally, our case studies reveal that FineMolTex successfully captures fine-grained knowledge, potentially offering valuable insights for drug discovery and catalyst design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a structured framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but their application requires efficient belief updates. Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filters (SIRPF), also known as Bootstrap Particle Filters, are commonly used as belief updaters in large approximate POMDP solvers, but they face challenges such as particle deprivation and high computational costs as the system's state dimension grows. To address these issues, this study introduces Rao-Blackwellized POMDP (RB-POMDP) approximate solvers and outlines generic methods to apply Rao-Blackwellization in both belief updates and online planning. We compare the performance of SIRPF and Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) in a simulated localization problem where an agent navigates toward a target in a GPS-denied environment using POMCPOW and RB-POMCPOW planners. Our results not only confirm that RBPFs maintain accurate belief approximations over time with fewer particles, but, more surprisingly, RBPFs combined with quadrature-based integration improve planning quality significantly compared to SIRPF-based planning under the same computational limits.</description>

      <title>Simulating Human-like Daily Activities with Desire-driven Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Desires motivate humans to interact autonomously with the complex world. In contrast, current AI agents require explicit task specifications, such as instructions or reward functions, which constrain their autonomy and behavioral diversity. In this paper, we introduce a Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) that can enable a large language model (LLM) to autonomously propose and select tasks, motivated by satisfying its multi-dimensional desires. Specifically, the motivational framework of D2A is mainly constructed by a dynamic Value System, inspired by the Theory of Needs. It incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. At each step, the agent evaluates the value of its current state, proposes a set of candidate activities, and selects the one that best aligns with its intrinsic motivations. We conduct experiments on Concordia, a text-based simulator, to demonstrate that our agent generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based agents demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.</description>

      <title>From Specific-MLLMs to Omni-MLLMs: A Survey on MLLMs Aligned with Multi-modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To tackle complex tasks in real-world scenarios, more researchers are focusing on Omni-MLLMs, which aim to achieve omni-modal understanding and generation. Beyond the constraints of any specific non-linguistic modality, Omni-MLLMs map various non-linguistic modalities into the embedding space of LLMs and enable the interaction and understanding of arbitrary combinations of modalities within a single model. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research and provide a comprehensive survey of Omni-MLLMs. Specifically, we first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLMs for unified multi-modal modeling with a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Then, we introduce the effective integration achieved through two-stage training and discuss the corresponding datasets as well as evaluation. Furthermore, we summarize the main challenges of current Omni-MLLMs and outline future directions. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and promotes the advancement of related research.

      <title>LABIIUM: AI-Enhanced Zero-configuration Measurement Automation System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</description>

      <title>B-STaR: Monitoring and Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in Self-Taught Reasoners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks, self-improvement -- where models are trained on their own outputs -- has emerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. However, the critical factors underlying the mechanism of these iterative self-improving methods remain poorly understood, such as under what conditions self-improvement is effective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations. In this work, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors in this iterative process: (1) the model's ability to generate sufficiently diverse responses (exploration); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in distinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones (exploitation). Using mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a quantitative analysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering that a model's exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations, and the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well. Motivated by these findings, we introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning framework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance exploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that B-STaR not only enhances the model's exploratory capabilities throughout training but also achieves a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to superior performance.</description>

      <title>POI-Enhancer: An LLM-based Semantic Enhancement Framework for POI Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: POI representation learning plays a crucial role in handling tasks related to user mobility data. Recent studies have shown that enriching POI representations with multimodal information can significantly enhance their task performance. Previously, the textual information incorporated into POI representations typically involved only POI categories or check-in content, leading to relatively weak textual features in existing methods. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive text data have been found to possess rich textual knowledge. However leveraging such knowledge to enhance POI representation learning presents two key challenges: first, how to extract POI-related knowledge from LLMs effectively, and second, how to integrate the extracted information to enhance POI representations. To address these challenges, we propose POI-Enhancer, a portable framework that leverages LLMs to improve POI representations produced by classic POI learning models. We first design three specialized prompts to extract semantic information from LLMs efficiently. Then, the Dual Feature Alignment module enhances the quality of the extracted information, while the Semantic Feature Fusion module preserves its integrity. The Cross Attention Fusion module then fully adaptively integrates such high-quality information into POI representations and Multi-View Contrastive Learning further injects human-understandable semantic information into these representations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing significant improvements across all baseline representations.</description>

      <title>Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the urbanization process, an increasing number of sensors are being deployed in transportation systems, leading to an explosion of big data. To harness the power of this vast transportation data, various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to address numerous transportation challenges. However, these methods often require significant investment in data collection, processing, storage, and the employment of professionals with expertise in transportation and ML. Additionally, privacy issues are a major concern when processing data for real-world traffic control and management. To address these challenges, the research team proposes an innovative Multi-agent framework named Independent Mobility GPT (IDM-GPT) based on large language models (LLMs) for customized traffic analysis, management suggestions, and privacy preservation. IDM-GPT efficiently connects users, transportation databases, and ML models economically. IDM-GPT trains, customizes, and applies various LLM-based AI agents for multiple functions, including user query comprehension, prompts optimization, data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation and enhancement. With IDM-GPT, users without any background in transportation or ML can efficiently and intuitively obtain data analysis and customized suggestions in near real-time based on their questions. Experimental results demonstrate that IDM-GPT delivers satisfactory performance across multiple traffic-related tasks, providing comprehensive and actionable insights that support effective traffic management and urban mobility improvement.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Speculative Decoding for a Tunable Accuracy-Runtime Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) enforces strict distributional equivalence to the target model, limiting potential speed ups as distributions of near-equivalence achieve comparable outcomes in many cases. Furthermore, enforcing distributional equivalence means that users are unable to trade deviations from the target model distribution for further inference speed gains. To address these limitations, we introduce Fuzzy Speculative Decoding (FSD) - a decoding algorithm that generalizes SD by accepting candidate tokens purely based on the divergences between the target and draft model distributions. By allowing for controlled divergence from the target model, FSD enables users to flexibly trade generation quality for inference speed. Across several benchmarks, our method is able to achieve significant runtime improvements of over 5 tokens per second faster than SD at only an approximate 2% absolute reduction in benchmark accuracy. In many cases, FSD is even able to match SD benchmark accuracy at over 2 tokens per second faster, demonstrating that distributional equivalence is not necessary to maintain target model performance.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Help Experimental Design for Causal Discovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing proper experiments and selecting optimal intervention targets is a longstanding problem in scientific or causal discovery. Identifying the underlying causal structure from observational data alone is inherently difficult. Obtaining interventional data, on the other hand, is crucial to causal discovery, yet it is usually expensive and time-consuming to gather sufficient interventional data to facilitate causal discovery. Previous approaches commonly utilize uncertainty or gradient signals to determine the intervention targets. However, numerical-based approaches may yield suboptimal results due to the inaccurate estimation of the guiding signals at the beginning when with limited interventional data. In this work, we investigate a different approach, whether we can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with the intervention targeting in causal discovery by making use of the rich world knowledge about the experimental design in LLMs. Specifically, we present Large Language Model Guided Intervention Targeting (LeGIT) -- a robust framework that effectively incorporates LLMs to augment existing numerical approaches for the intervention targeting in causal discovery. Across 4 realistic benchmark scales, LeGIT demonstrates significant improvements and robustness over existing methods and even surpasses humans, which demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs in assisting with experimental design for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't use the CLT in LLM evals with fewer than a few hundred datapoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.13986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine whether data generated by explanation techniques, which promote a process of self-reflection, can improve classifier performance. Our work is based on the idea that humans have the ability to make quick, intuitive decisions as well as to reflect on their own thinking and learn from explanations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the potential of mimicking this process by using explanations generated by explainability methods has been explored. We found that combining explanations with traditional labeled data leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and training efficiency across multiple image classification datasets and convolutional neural network architectures. It is worth noting that during training, we not only used explanations for the correct or predicted class, but also for other classes. This serves multiple purposes, including allowing for reflection on potential outcomes and enriching the data through augmentation.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.03223v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on overall more than 40 data sets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods including the threshold selection-based Median Sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman's mixture model, and Friedman's method that performs best in the binary setting. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the Generalized Probabilistic Adjusted Count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman's method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers to identify opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Explainable fetal ultrasound quality assessment with progressive concept bottleneck models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of fetal ultrasound screening scans directly influences the precision of biometric measurements. However, acquiring high-quality scans is labor-intensive and highly relies on the operator's skills. Considering the low contrastiveness and imaging artifacts that widely exist in ultrasound, even a dedicated deep-learning model can be vulnerable to learning from confounding information in the image. In this paper, we propose a holistic and explainable method for fetal ultrasound quality assessment, where we design a hierarchical concept bottleneck model by introducing human-readable ``concepts" into the task and imitating the sequential expert decision-making process. This hierarchical information flow forces the model to learn concepts from semantically meaningful areas: The model first passes through a layer of visual, segmentation-based concepts, and next a second layer of property concepts directly associated with the decision-making task. We consider the quality assessment to be in a more challenging but more realistic setting, with fine-grained image recognition. Experiments show that our model outperforms equivalent concept-free models on an in-house dataset, and shows better generalizability on two public benchmarks, one from Spain and one from Africa, without any fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Modeling Relational Patterns for Logical Query Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering first-order logical (FOL) queries over knowledge graphs (KG) remains a challenging task mainly due to KG incompleteness. Query embedding approaches this problem by computing the low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and logical queries. KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the advantage of relational patterns for enhancing logical query answering task.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Adversarial Training over Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Computing via Autonomous Quantum Thermal Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a physics-based model for classical computation based on autonomous quantum thermal machines. These machines consist of few interacting quantum bits (qubits) connected to several environments at different temperatures. Heat flows through the machine are here exploited for computing. The process starts by setting the temperatures of the environments according to the logical input. The machine evolves, eventually reaching a non-equilibrium steady state, from which the output of the computation can be determined via the temperature of an auxilliary finite-size reservoir. Such a machine, which we term a ``thermodynamic neuron'', can implement any linearly-separable function, and we discuss explicitly the cases of NOT, 3-MAJORITY and NOR gates. In turn, we show that a network of thermodynamic neurons can perform any desired function. We discuss the close connection between our model and artificial neurons (perceptrons), and argue that our model provides an alternative physics-based analogue implementation of neural networks, and more generally a platform for thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Diversifying Question Generation over Knowledge Base via External Natural Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous methods on knowledge base question generation (KBQG) primarily focus on enhancing the quality of a single generated question. Recognizing the remarkable paraphrasing ability of humans, we contend that diverse texts should convey the same semantics through varied expressions. The above insights make diversifying question generation an intriguing task, where the first challenge is evaluation metrics for diversity. Current metrics inadequately assess the above diversity since they calculate the ratio of unique n-grams in the generated question itself, which leans more towards measuring duplication rather than true diversity. Accordingly, we devise a new diversity evaluation metric, which measures the diversity among top-k generated questions for each instance while ensuring their relevance to the ground truth. Clearly, the second challenge is how to enhance diversifying question generation. To address this challenge, we introduce a dual model framework interwoven by two selection strategies to generate diverse questions leveraging external natural questions. The main idea of our dual framework is to extract more diverse expressions and integrate them into the generation model to enhance diversifying question generation. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks for KBQG demonstrate that our proposed approach generates highly diverse questions and improves the performance of question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Assessing Robustness via Score-Based Adversarial Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most adversarial attacks and defenses focus on perturbations within small $\ell_p$-norm constraints. However, $\ell_p$ threat models cannot capture all relevant semantics-preserving perturbations, and hence, the scope of robustness evaluations is limited. In this work, we introduce Score-Based Adversarial Generation (ScoreAG), a novel framework that leverages the advancements in score-based generative models to generate unrestricted adversarial examples that overcome the limitations of $\ell_p$-norm constraints. Unlike traditional methods, ScoreAG maintains the core semantics of images while generating adversarial examples, either by transforming existing images or synthesizing new ones entirely from scratch. We further exploit the generative capability of ScoreAG to purify images, empirically enhancing the robustness of classifiers. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that ScoreAG improves upon the majority of state-of-the-art attacks and defenses across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the importance of investigating adversarial examples bounded by semantics rather than $\ell_p$-norm constraints. ScoreAG represents an important step towards more encompassing robustness assessments.</description>

      <title>AI-based association analysis for medical imaging using latent-space geometric confounder correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of confounding effects and interpretability in artificial-intelligence-based medical image analysis. Whereas existing literature often resolves confounding by removing confounder-related information from latent representations, this strategy risks affecting image reconstruction quality in generative models, thus limiting their applicability in feature visualization. To tackle this, we propose a different strategy that retains confounder-related information in latent representations while finding an alternative confounder-free representation of the image data.
  Our approach views the latent space of an autoencoder as a vector space, where imaging-related variables, such as the learning target (t) and confounder (c), have a vector capturing their variability. The confounding problem is addressed by searching a confounder-free vector which is orthogonal to the confounder-related vector but maximally collinear to the target-related vector. To achieve this, we introduce a novel correlation-based loss that not only performs vector searching in the latent space, but also encourages the encoder to generate latent representations linearly correlated with the variables. Subsequently, we interpret the confounder-free representation by sampling and reconstructing images along the confounder-free vector.
  The efficacy and flexibility of our proposed method are demonstrated across three applications, accommodating multiple confounders and utilizing diverse image modalities. Results affirm the method's effectiveness in reducing confounder influences, preventing wrong or misleading associations, and offering a unique visual interpretation for in-depth investigations by clinical and epidemiological researchers. The code is released in the following GitLab repository: https://gitlab.com/radiology/compopbio/ai_based_association_analysis}</description>

      <title>DiffTORI: Differentiable Trajectory Optimization for Deep Reinforcement and Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05421v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/wkwan7/DiffTORI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) is essential for robots to interact with the world and accomplish complex tasks. The TAMP problem involves a critical gap: exploring the robot's configuration parameters (such as chassis position and robotic arm joint angles) within continuous space to ensure that task-level global constraints are met while also enhancing the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Existing methods still have significant room for improvement in terms of efficiency. Recognizing that robot kinematics is a key factor in motion planning, we propose a framework called the Robotic Kinematics Informed Neural Network (RobKiNet) as a bridge between task and motion layers. RobKiNet integrates kinematic knowledge into neural networks to train models capable of efficient configuration prediction. We designed a Chassis Motion Predictor(CMP) and a Full Motion Predictor(FMP) using RobKiNet, which employed two entirely different sets of forward and inverse kinematics constraints to achieve loosely coupled control and whole-body control, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that CMP and FMP can predict configuration parameters with 96.67% and 98% accuracy, respectively. That means that the corresponding motion planning can achieve a speedup of 24.24x and 153x compared to random sampling. Furthermore, RobKiNet demonstrates remarkable data efficiency. CMP only requires 1/71 and FMP only requires 1/15052 of the training data for the same prediction accuracy compared to other deep learning methods. These results demonstrate the great potential of RoboKiNet in robot applications.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal and Computationally Efficient Algorithms for Distributionally Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), which seeks robust policy training against environment perturbation by modeling dynamics uncertainty, calls for function approximations when facing large state-action spaces. However, the consideration of dynamics uncertainty introduces essential nonlinearity and computational burden, posing unique challenges for analyzing and practically employing function approximation. Focusing on a basic setting where the nominal model and perturbed models are linearly parameterized, we propose minimax optimal and computationally efficient algorithms realizing function approximation and initiate the study on instance-dependent suboptimality analysis in the context of robust offline RL. Our results uncover that function approximation in robust offline RL is essentially distinct from and probably harder than that in standard offline RL. Our algorithms and theoretical results crucially depend on a novel function approximation mechanism incorporating variance information, a new procedure of suboptimality and estimation uncertainty decomposition, a quantification of the robust value function shrinkage, and a meticulously designed family of hard instances, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>From Matching to Generation: A Survey on Generative Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, which have long been dominated by traditional methods relying on similarity matching. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, generative information retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: \textbf{(1) Generative Document Retrieval} (GR) leverages the generative model's parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. \textbf{(2) Reliable Response Generation} employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This paper aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, etc., as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, etc. We also review the evaluation, challenges and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field. Github Repository: https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/GenIR-Survey</description>

      <title>Bootstrap-GS: Self-Supervised Augmentation for High-Fidelity Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have established new benchmarks for rendering quality and efficiency in 3D reconstruction. However, 3D-GS faces critical limitations when generating novel views that significantly deviate from those encountered during training. Moreover, issues such as dilation and aliasing arise during zoom operations. These challenges stem from a fundamental issue: training sampling deficiency. In this paper, we introduce a bootstrapping framework to address this problem. Our approach synthesizes pseudo-ground truth from novel views that align with the limited training set and reintegrates these synthesized views into the training pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that our bootstrapping technique not only reduces artifacts but also improves quantitative metrics. Furthermore, our technique is highly adaptable, allowing various Gaussian-based method to benefit from its integration.</description>

      <title>UniDEC : Unified Dual Encoder and Classifier Training for Extreme Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) involves predicting a subset of relevant labels from an extremely large label space, given an input query and labels with textual features. Models developed for this problem have conventionally made use of dual encoder (DE) to embed the queries and label texts and one-vs-all (OvA) classifiers to rerank the shortlisted labels by the DE. While such methods have shown empirical success, a major drawback is their computational cost, often requiring upto 16 GPUs to train on the largest public dataset. Such a high cost is a consequence of calculating the loss over the entire label space. While shortlisting strategies have been proposed for classifiers, we aim to study such methods for the DE framework. In this work, we develop UniDEC, a loss-independent, end-to-end trainable framework which trains the DE and classifier together in a unified manner with a multi-class loss, while reducing the computational cost by 4-16x. This is done via the proposed pick-some-label (PSL) reduction, which aims to compute the loss on only a subset of positive and negative labels. These labels are carefully chosen in-batch so as to maximise their supervisory signals. Not only does the proposed framework achieve state-of-the-art results on datasets with labels in the order of millions, it is also computationally and resource efficient in achieving this performance on a single GPU. Code is made available at https://github.com/the-catalyst/UniDEC.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion: Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment and Spatially-variant Deformation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) has been extensively studied and great progress has been made, there are still key challenges that hinder their broad real-world applications: 1) the inherent motion/rotation ambiguity requires either explicit camera motion recovery with extra constraint or complex Procrustean Alignment; 2) existing low-rank modeling of the global shape can over-penalize drastic deformations in the 3D shape sequence. This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Interaction Modeling for Trajectory Prediction via Agent Selection and Physical Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13152v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Laurel: Unblocking Automated Verification with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Program verifiers such as Dafny automate proofs by outsourcing them to an SMT solver. This automation is not perfect, however, and the solver often requires hints in the form of assertions, creating a burden for the proof engineer. In this paper, we propose Laurel, a tool that alleviates this burden by automatically generating assertions using large language models (LLMs). To improve the success rate of LLMs in this task, we design two domain-specific prompting techniques. First, we help the LLM determine the location of the missing assertion by analyzing the verifier's error message and inserting an assertion placeholder at that location. Second, we provide the LLM with example assertions from the same codebase, which we select based on a new proof similarity metric. We evaluate our techniques on our new benchmark DafnyGym, a dataset of complex lemmas we extracted from three real-world Dafny codebases. Our evaluation shows that Laurel is able to generate over 56.6\% of the required assertions given only a few attempts, making LLMs an affordable tool for unblocking program verifiers without human intervention.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resetting Mitigates Latent Gradient Bias of SGD from Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Spread Preference Annotation: Direct Preference Judgment for Efficient LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data. Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data. To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective. In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs. For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce chain-of-thought reasoning, they lack a principled framework to capture latent structures and model uncertainty, especially in compositional reasoning tasks. We propose Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian prompting framework that guides LLMs to simulate key principles of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) in natural language. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise or specialized training, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions or scarce data. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.</description>

      <title>Talking Heads: Understanding Inter-layer Communication in Transformer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used in two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that it underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval behaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later layers, forming low-rank communication channels (Elhage et al., 2021) between layers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed to positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct information from context when many items ``crowd" this limited space. By decomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence-Guided User Studies: An Application for Air Taxi Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User studies are crucial for meeting user needs. In user studies, real experimental scenarios and participants are constructed and recruited. However, emerging and unfamiliar studies face limitations, including safety concerns and iterative efficiency. To address these challenges, this study utilises a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create GenAI-generated scenarios for user experience (UX). By recruiting real users to evaluate this experience, we can collect feedback that enables rapid iteration in the early design phase. The air taxi is particularly representative of these challenges and has been chosen as the case study for this research. The key contribution was designing an Air Taxi Journey (ATJ) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI image and video generators. Based on the GPT-4-generated scripts, key visuals were created for the air taxi, and the ATJ was evaluated by 72 participants. Furthermore, the LLMs demonstrated the ability to identify and suggest environments that significantly improve participants' willingness toward air taxis. Education level and gender significantly influenced participants' the difference in willingness and their satisfaction with the ATJ. Satisfaction with the ATJ serves as a mediator, significantly influencing participants' willingness to take air taxis. Our study confirms the capability of GenAI to support user studies, providing a feasible approach and valuable insights for designing air taxi UX in the early design phase.</description>

      <title>The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specifying reward functions that capture the intended task can be very challenging. Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the data distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. We hope our results stimulate the theoretical and empirical study of improved methods to learn reward models, and better ways to measure their quality reliably.</description>

      <title>M2Lingual: Enhancing Multilingual, Multi-Turn Instruction Alignment in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction finetuning (IFT) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. While many effective IFT datasets have been introduced recently, they predominantly focus on high-resource languages like English. To better align LLMs across a broad spectrum of languages and tasks, we propose a fully synthetic, novel taxonomy (Evol) guided Multilingual, Multi-turn instruction finetuning dataset, called M2Lingual. It is constructed by first selecting a diverse set of seed examples and then utilizing the proposed Evol taxonomy to convert these seeds into complex and challenging multi-turn instructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of M2Lingual by training LLMs of varying sizes and showcasing the enhanced performance across a diverse set of languages. We contribute the 2 step Evol taxonomy with the guided generation code: https://github.com/ServiceNow/M2Lingual, as well as the first fully synthetic, general and task-oriented, multi-turn, multilingual dataset built with Evol - M2Lingual: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow-AI/ M2Lingual - containing 182K total IFT pairs, covering 70 languages and 17+ NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Few-shot Personalization of LLMs with Mis-aligned Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the diversity of users increases, the capability of providing personalized responses by large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important. Existing approaches have only limited successes in LLM personalization, due to the absence of personalized learning or the reliance on shared personal data. This paper proposes a new approach for a few-shot personalization of LLMs with their mis-aligned responses (Fermi). Our key idea is to learn a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile (e.g., demographic information) and a few examples of previous opinions. During an iterative process of prompt improvement, we incorporate the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are especially crucial for the effective personalization of LLMs. In addition, we develop an effective inference method to further leverage the context of the test query and the personalized prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks, compared to best-performing baselines.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Random Walks for Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a simple model class for machine learning on graphs, where a random walk on a graph produces a machine-readable record, and this record is processed by a deep neural network to directly make vertex-level or graph-level predictions. We call these stochastic machines random walk neural networks (RWNNs), and through principled analysis, show that we can design them to be isomorphism invariant while capable of universal approximation of graph functions in probability. A useful finding is that almost any kind of record of random walks guarantees probabilistic invariance as long as the vertices are anonymized. This enables us, for example, to record random walks in plain text and adopt a language model to read these text records to solve graph tasks. We further establish a parallelism to message passing neural networks using tools from Markov chain theory, and show that over-smoothing in message passing is alleviated by construction in RWNNs, while over-squashing manifests as probabilistic under-reaching. We empirically demonstrate RWNNs on a range of problems, verifying our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the use of language models for separating strongly regular graphs where 3-WL test fails, and transductive classification on arXiv citation network.

      <title>Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Best-of-N Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) is a popular and effective algorithm for aligning language models to human preferences. The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled generation and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective alignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest performance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard KL-constrained RL objective. In the controlled generation task, vBoN appears more frequently on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to other alignment methods. In the summarization task, vBoN achieves high reward values across various sampling temperatures.</description>

      <title>Transformer Block Coupling and its Correlation with Generalization in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07810v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we analyze the trajectories of token embeddings as they pass through transformer blocks, linearizing the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these block Jacobians, we uncover the phenomenon of \textbf{transformer block coupling} in a multitude of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling \textit{positively correlates} with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters such as parameter count, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate the emergence of these properties through training, observing the progressive development of coupling, as well as increased linearity and layer-wise exponential growth in the token trajectories. Additionally, experiments with ViTs further validate emergence of coupling and its correlation between coupling and generalization, complementing our findings in LLMs. Collectively, these insights provide a novel perspective on token interactions in transformers and open directions for studying and improving training and generalization.</description>

      <title>TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09164v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. In this paper, we reveal that both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process, which may not be practical; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an attack success rate of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an attack success rate of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional perturbation.</description>

      <title>Affordance-Guided Reinforcement Learning via Visual Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10341v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots equipped with reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to learn a wide range of skills solely from a reward signal. However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive reasoning about affordances through keypoints in zero-shot, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 20K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 35K online fine-tuning steps.

      <title>KiVA: Kid-inspired Visual Analogies for Testing Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates visual analogical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) compared to human adults and children. A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.</description>

Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries (i.e., NL2SQL, a.k.a., Text-to-SQL) can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Causal Reasoning Benchmark: Challenging Vision Large Language Models to Discern Causal Links Across Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased exceptional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning ability in complex textual inference tasks including causal reasoning. However, will these causalities remain straightforward when crucial hints hide in visual details? If not, what factors might influence cross-modal generalization? Whether we can effectively enhance their capacity for robust causal inference across both text and vision? Motivated by these, we introduce MuCR - a novel Multimodal Causal Reasoning benchmark that leverages synthetic siamese images and text pairs to challenge MLLMs. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess MLLMs' comprehension abilities. Our experiments reveal that current MLLMs fall short in multimodal causal reasoning compared to their performance in purely textual settings. Additionally, we find that identifying visual cues across images is key to effective cross-modal generalization. Finally, we propose a VcCoT strategy that better highlights visual cues, and our results confirm its efficacy in enhancing multimodal causal reasoning.

      <title>R2Det: Exploring Relaxed Rotation Equivariance in 2D object detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore underlying symmetry in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness. The code is available in \texttt{https://github.com/wuer5/r2det}.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Development Through Longitudinal Study: Insights from the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper conducts a longitudinal study over eleven months to address the limitations of prior research on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard, which have relied on empirical studies with restricted observation periods of only five months. By extending the analysis duration, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the progression in developing Korean large language models (LLMs). Our study is guided by three primary research questions: (1) What are the specific challenges in improving LLM performance across diverse tasks on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard over time? (2) How does model size impact task performance correlations across various benchmarks? (3) How have the patterns in leaderboard rankings shifted over time on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard?. By analyzing 1,769 models over this period, our research offers a comprehensive examination of the ongoing advancements in LLMs and the evolving nature of evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Continual Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn new data while remembering previously acquired knowledge. In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</description>

      <title>Analyzing mixed construction and demolition waste in material recovery facilities: evolution, challenges, and applications of computer vision and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the automatic and timely recognition of construction and demolition waste composition is crucial for enhancing business returns, economic outcomes and sustainability. While deep learning models show promise in recognizing and classifying homogenous materials, the current literature lacks research assessing their performance for mixed, contaminated material in commercial material recycling facility settings. Despite the increasing numbers of deep learning models and datasets generated in this area, the sub-domain of deep learning analysis of construction and demolition waste piles remains underexplored. To address this gap, recent deep learning algorithms and techniques were explored. This review examines the progression in datasets, sensors and the evolution from object detection towards real-time segmentation models. It also synthesizes research from the past five years on deep learning for construction and demolition waste management, highlighting recent advancements while acknowledging limitations that hinder widespread commercial adoption. The analysis underscores the critical requirement for diverse and high-fidelity datasets, advanced sensor technologies, and robust algorithmic frameworks to facilitate the effective integration of deep learning methodologies into construction and demolition waste management systems. This integration is envisioned to contribute significantly towards the advancement of a more sustainable and circular economic model.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Autism Diagnosis: Identifying Critical Brain Regions Using fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.</description>

      <title>From homeostasis to resource sharing: Biologically and economically aligned multi-objective multi-agent AI safety benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing safe, aligned agentic AI systems requires comprehensive empirical testing, yet many existing benchmarks neglect crucial themes aligned with biology and economics, both time-tested fundamental sciences describing our needs and preferences. To address this gap, the present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in current mainstream discussions on AI safety - namely a set of multi-objective, multi-agent alignment benchmarks that emphasize homeostasis for bounded and biological objectives, diminishing returns for unbounded, instrumental, and business objectives, sustainability principle, and resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, to illustrate key pitfalls and challenges in agentic AI-s, such as unboundedly maximizing a homeostatic objective, over-optimizing one objective at the expense of others, neglecting safety constraints, or depleting shared resources.</description>

      <title>Layer Swapping for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</description>

      <title>Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Enhanced Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep neural networks (CNNs) are costly to train, while modern architectures can retain hundreds of convolutional layers in network depth. Standard convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where multiple layers are needed to learn complex patterns, making this approach computationally inefficient and prone to optimization difficulties. As a result, we introduce RKAN (Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network), which could be easily implemented into stages of traditional networks, such as ResNet. The module also integrates polynomial feature transformation that provides the expressive power of many convolutional layers through learnable, non-linear feature refinement. Our proposed RKAN module offers consistent improvements over the base models on various well-known benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-100, Food-101, and ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.
  We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts. We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Slow Decision Frequencies in Continuous Control: Model-Based Sequence Reinforcement Learning for Model-Free Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning. Lastly, we highlight the biological relevance of SRL, showing that it replicates the "action chunking" behavior observed in the basal ganglia, offering insights into brain-inspired control mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Improving Semantic Understanding in Speech Language Models via Brain-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech language models align with human brain responses to natural language to an impressive degree. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories, a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on a range of downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models' semantic understanding.</description>

      <title>Speculative Knowledge Distillation: Bridging the Teacher-Student Gap Through Interleaved Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) have enabled smaller student models to approach the performance of larger teacher models. However, popular methods such as supervised KD and on-policy KD, are adversely impacted by the knowledge gaps between teacher-student in practical scenarios. Supervised KD suffers from a distribution mismatch between training with a static dataset and inference over final student-generated outputs. Conversely, on-policy KD, which uses student-generated samples for training, can suffer from low-quality training examples with which teacher models are not familiar, resulting in inaccurate teacher feedback. To address these limitations, we introduce Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a novel approach that leverages cooperation between student and teacher models to generate high-quality training data on-the-fly while aligning with the student's inference-time distribution. In SKD, the student proposes tokens, and the teacher replaces poorly ranked ones based on its own distribution, transferring high-quality knowledge adaptively. We evaluate SKD on various text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, math, and instruction following, and show that SKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods across different domains, data sizes, and model initialization strategies.</description>

      <title>GaVaMoE: Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts for Explainable Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model-based explainable recommendation (LLM-based ER) systems show promise in generating human-like explanations for recommendations. However, they face challenges in modeling user-item collaborative preferences, personalizing explanations, and handling sparse user-item interactions. To address these issues, we propose GaVaMoE, a novel Gaussian-Variational Gated Mixture of Experts framework for explainable recommendation. GaVaMoE introduces two key components: (1) a rating reconstruction module that employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to capture complex user-item collaborative preferences, serving as a pre-trained multi-gating mechanism; and (2) a set of fine-grained expert models coupled with the multi-gating mechanism for generating highly personalized explanations. The VAE component models latent factors in user-item interactions, while the GMM clusters users with similar behaviors. Each cluster corresponds to a gate in the multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert models. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for specific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging user similarities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GaVaMoE significantly outperforms existing methods in explanation quality, personalization, and consistency. Notably, GaVaMoE exhibits robust performance in scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, maintaining high-quality explanations even for users with limited historical data.</description>

      <title>Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2: Bridging Foundational and Practical Evaluation for Korean LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard has been instrumental in benchmarking Korean Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it has certain limitations. Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</description>

      <title>Improving Pronunciation and Accent Conversion through Knowledge Distillation And Synthetic Ground-Truth from Native TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous approaches on accent conversion (AC) mainly aimed at making non-native speech sound more native while maintaining the original content and speaker identity. However, non-native speakers sometimes have pronunciation issues, which can make it difficult for listeners to understand them. Hence, we developed a new AC approach that not only focuses on accent conversion but also improves pronunciation of non-native accented speaker. By providing the non-native audio and the corresponding transcript, we generate the ideal ground-truth audio with native-like pronunciation with original duration and prosody. This ground-truth data aids the model in learning a direct mapping between accented and native speech. We utilize the end-to-end VITS framework to achieve high-quality waveform reconstruction for the AC task. As a result, our system not only produces audio that closely resembles native accents and while retaining the original speaker's identity but also improve pronunciation, as demonstrated by evaluation results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19302</link>

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on high-dimensional (latent) embeddings for modeling user-item interactions, often resulting in opaque representations that lack interpretability. Moreover, these systems offer limited control to users over their recommendations. Inspired by recent work, we introduce TExtuAl Representations for Scrutable recommendations (TEARS) to address these challenges. Instead of representing a user's interests through a latent embedding, TEARS encodes them in natural text, providing transparency and allowing users to edit them. To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user summaries based on user preferences. We find the summaries capture user preferences uniquely. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we use an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with the learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering. We find this approach can surpass the performance of three popular VAE models while providing user-controllable recommendations. We also analyze the controllability of TEARS through three simulated user tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of a user editing its summary.</description>

      <title>Danoliteracy of Generative Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The language technology moonshot moment of Generative Large Language Models (GLLMs) was not limited to English: These models brought a surge of technological applications, investments, and hype to low-resource languages as well. However, the capabilities of these models in languages such as Danish were, until recently, difficult to verify beyond qualitative demonstrations due to a lack of applicable evaluation corpora. We present a GLLM benchmark to evaluate \emph{Danoliteracy}, a measure of Danish language and cultural competency across eight diverse scenarios such as Danish citizenship tests and abstractive social media question answering. This limited-size benchmark was found to produce a robust ranking that correlates to human feedback at $\rho \sim 0.8$ with GPT-4 and Claude Opus models achieving the highest rankings. Analyzing these model results across scenarios, we find one strong underlying factor explaining $95\%$ of scenario performance variance for GLLMs in Danish, suggesting a $g$ factor of model consistency in language adaptation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend anytime constraints to the Markov game setting and the corresponding solution concept of an anytime-constrained equilibrium (ACE). Then, we present a comprehensive theory of anytime-constrained equilibria that includes (1) a computational characterization of feasible policies, (2) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing ACE, and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for approximately computing ACE. Since computing a feasible policy is NP-hard even for two-player zero-sum games, our approximation guarantees are optimal so long as $P \neq NP$. We also develop the first theory of efficient computation for action-constrained Markov games, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>GlotCC: An Open Broad-Coverage CommonCrawl Corpus and Pipeline for Minority Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The need for large text corpora has increased with the advent of pretrained language models and, in particular, the discovery of scaling laws for these models. Most available corpora have sufficient data only for languages with large dominant communities. However, there is no corpus available that (i) covers a wide range of minority languages; (ii) is generated by an open-source reproducible pipeline; and (iii) is rigorously cleaned from noise, making it trustworthy to use. We present GlotCC, a clean, document-level, 2TB general domain corpus derived from CommonCrawl, covering more than 1000 languages. We make GlotCC and the system used to generate it - including the pipeline, language identification model, and filters - available to the research community.

      <title>SkyServe: Serving AI Models across Regions and Clouds with Spot Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of AI models. The high cost of hosting AI services on GPUs and their demanding service requirements, make it timely and challenging to lower service costs and guarantee service quality. While spot instances have long been offered with a large discount, spot preemptions have discouraged users from using them to host model replicas when serving AI models.
  To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient policy, SpotHedge, that leverages spot replicas across different failure domains (e.g., regions and clouds) to ensure availability, lower costs, and high service quality. SpotHedge intelligently spreads spot replicas across different regions and clouds to improve availability and reduce correlated preemptions, overprovisions cheap spot replicas than required as a safeguard against possible preemptions, and dynamically falls back to on-demand replicas when spot replicas become unavailable. We built SkyServe, a system leveraging SpotHedge to efficiently serve AI models over a mixture of spot and on-demand replicas across regions and clouds. We compared SkyServe with both research and production systems on real AI workloads: SkyServe reduces cost by 43% on average while achieving high resource availability compared to using on-demand replicas. Additionally, SkyServe improves P50, P90, and P99 latency by 2.3$\times$, 2.1$\times$, 2.1$\times$ on average compared to other research and production systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Creative Short Story Generation in Humans and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.</description>

      <title>Neural Internal Model Control: Learning a Robust Control Policy via Predictive Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion control in the face of disturbances within complex environments remains a major challenge in robotics. Classical model-based approaches often struggle with nonlinearities and unstructured disturbances, while RL-based methods can be fragile when encountering unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Neural Internal Model Control, which integrates model-based control with RL-based control to enhance robustness. Our framework streamlines the predictive model by applying Newton-Euler equations for rigid-body dynamics, eliminating the need to capture complex high-dimensional nonlinearities. This internal model combines model-free RL algorithms with predictive error feedback. Such a design enables a closed-loop control structure to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the control system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both quadrotors and quadrupedal robots, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment on a quadrotor with rope-suspended payloads highlights the framework's robustness in sim-to-real transfer. Our code is released at https://github.com/thu-uav/NeuralIMC.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Quantum Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative quantum machine learning has gained significant attention for its ability to produce quantum states with desired distributions. Among various quantum generative models, quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 100602 (2024)] provide a promising approach with stepwise learning that resolves the training issues. However, the requirement of high-fidelity scrambling unitaries in QuDDPM poses a challenge in near-term implementation. We propose the \textit{mixed-state quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model} (MSQuDDPM) to eliminate the need for scrambling unitaries. Our approach focuses on adapting the quantum noise channels to the model architecture, which integrates depolarizing noise channels in the forward diffusion process and parameterized quantum circuits with projective measurements in the backward denoising steps. We also introduce several techniques to improve MSQuDDPM, including a cosine-exponent schedule of noise interpolation, the use of single-qubit random ancilla, and superfidelity-based cost functions to enhance the convergence. We evaluate MSQuDDPM on quantum ensemble generation tasks, demonstrating its successful performance.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>

      <title>SeqAfford: Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D affordance segmentation aims to link human instructions to touchable regions of 3D objects for embodied manipulations. Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Generalization Through the Data-Centric Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon is the driver for important machine learning applications including highly data-efficient learning and, most recently, performing superalignment. While decades of research have resulted in numerous algorithms that produce strong empirical performance, understanding what aspects of data enable weak-to-strong generalization has been understudied. We propose a simple data-centric mechanism that characterizes weak-to-strong generalization: the overlap density. Intuitively, generalization tracks the number of points that contain overlaps, i.e., both easy patterns (learnable by a weak model) and challenging patterns (only learnable by a stronger model), as with such points, weak predictions can be used to learn challenging patterns by stronger models. We provide a practical overlap detection algorithm to find such points in datasets and leverage them to learn, among multiple sources of data, which to query when seeking to maximize overlap density and thereby enhance weak-to-strong generalization. We present a theoretical result showing that the generalization benefit is a function of the overlap density and a regret bound for our data selection algorithm. Empirically, we validate the mechanism and the overlap detection algorithm on a wide array of settings.</description>

      <title>Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</description>

Abstract: The paper ``Tropical Geometry of Deep Neural Networks'' by L. Zhang et al. introduces an equivalence between integer-valued neural networks (IVNN) with $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ and tropical rational functions, which come with a map to polytopes. Here, IVNN refers to a network with integer weights but real biases, and $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ is defined as $\text{ReLU}_{t}(x)=\max(x,t)$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.
  For every poset with $n$ points, there exists a corresponding order polytope, i.e., a convex polytope in the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ whose coordinates obey the inequalities of the poset. We study neural networks whose associated polytope is an order polytope. We then explain how posets with four points induce neural networks that can be interpreted as $2\times 2$ convolutional filters. These poset filters can be added to any neural network, not only IVNN.
  Similarly to maxout, poset pooling filters update the weights of the neural network during backpropagation with more precision than average pooling, max pooling, or mixed pooling, without the need to train extra parameters. We report experiments that support our statements.
  We also define the structure of algebra over the operad of posets on poset neural networks and tropical polynomials. This formalism allows us to study the composition of poset neural network arquitectures and the effect on their corresponding Newton polytopes, via the introduction of the generalization of two operations on polytopes: the Minkowski sum and the convex envelope.</description>

      <title>Balancing Efficiency and Effectiveness: An LLM-Infused Approach for Optimized CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is essential in online advertising, where semantic information plays a pivotal role in shaping user decisions and enhancing CTR effectiveness. Capturing and modeling deep semantic information, such as a user's preference for "H\"aagen-Dazs' HEAVEN strawberry light ice cream" due to its health-conscious and premium attributes, is challenging. Traditional semantic modeling often overlooks these intricate details at the user and item levels. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel approach that models deep semantic information end-to-end, leveraging the comprehensive world knowledge capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed LLM-infused CTR prediction framework(Multi-level Deep Semantic Information Infused CTR model via Distillation, MSD) is designed to uncover deep semantic insights by utilizing LLMs to extract and distill critical information into a smaller, more efficient model, enabling seamless end-to-end training and inference. Importantly, our framework is carefully designed to balance efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that the model not only achieves high performance but also operates with optimal resource utilization. Online A/B tests conducted on the Meituan sponsored-search system demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of Cost Per Mile (CPM) and CTR, validating its effectiveness, scalability, and balanced approach in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Toxicity Detection towards Adaptability to Changing Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.</description>

      <title>WalkVLM:Aid Visually Impaired People Walking by Vision Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximately 200 million individuals around the world suffer from varying degrees of visual impairment, making it crucial to leverage AI technology to offer walking assistance for these people. With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), applying VLMs to offer walking guidance has become popular. However, the existing methods of walking guidance are mainly based on self-curated question-answering datasets that are not publicly accessible, without a standardized benchmark for training or evaluation. Moreover, walking assistance often requires real-time streaming video analysis and the generation of concise yet informative reminders, making VLMs struggle due to excessive responses and low efficiency in inferences. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale dataset dedicated to walking assistance, comprising 12,000 video-annotation pairs, to provide a unified benchmark for training and evaluating systems to help visually-impaired individuals walk. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code are available at https://walkvlm2024.github.io.</description>

      <title>Key-value memory in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical models of memory in psychology and neuroscience rely on similarity-based retrieval of stored patterns, where similarity is a function of retrieval cues and the stored patterns. While parsimonious, these models do not allow distinct representations for storage and retrieval, despite their distinct computational demands. Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.</description>

      <title>VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy for improving the factual accuracy of models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into the generation process. However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/starsuzi/VideoRAG.</description>

      <title>AutoRestTest: A Tool for Automated REST API Testing Using LLMs and MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As REST APIs have become widespread in modern web services, comprehensive testing of these APIs is increasingly crucial. Because of the vast search space of operations, parameters, and parameter values, along with their dependencies and constraints, current testing tools often achieve low code coverage, resulting in suboptimal fault detection. To address this limitation, we present AutoRestTest, a novel tool that integrates the Semantic Property Dependency Graph (SPDG) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) for effective REST API testing. AutoRestTest determines operation-dependent parameters using the SPDG and employs five specialized agents (operation, parameter, value, dependency, and header) to identify dependencies of operations and generate operation sequences, parameter combinations, and values. Through an intuitive command-line interface, users can easily configure and monitor tests with successful operation count, unique server errors detected, and time elapsed. Upon completion, AutoRestTest generates a detailed report highlighting errors detected and operations exercised. In this paper, we introduce our tool and present preliminary findings, with a demonstration video available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVus2W8rap8.</description>

      <title>PolaFormer: Polarity-aware Linear Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a promising alternative to softmax-based attention, leveraging kernelized feature maps to reduce complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. However, the non-negative constraint on feature maps and the relaxed exponential function used in approximation lead to significant information loss compared to the original query-key dot products, resulting in less discriminative attention maps with higher entropy. To address the missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we propose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both same-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relational information. Furthermore, to restore the spiky properties of attention maps, we provide a theoretical analysis proving the existence of a class of element-wise functions (with positive first and second derivatives) that can reduce entropy in the attention distribution. For simplicity, and recognizing the distinct contributions of each dimension, we employ a learnable power function for rescaling, allowing strong and weak attention signals to be effectively separated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PolaFormer improves performance on various vision tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.6%.</description>

      <title>AxBench: Steering LLMs? Even Simple Baselines Outperform Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</description>

      <title>DermaSynth: Rich Synthetic Image-Text Pairs Using Open Access Dermatology Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major barrier to developing vision large language models (LLMs) in dermatology is the lack of large image--text pairs dataset. We introduce DermaSynth, a dataset comprising of 92,020 synthetic image--text pairs curated from 45,205 images (13,568 clinical and 35,561 dermatoscopic) for dermatology-related clinical tasks. Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically related prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic texts. Metadata of the datasets were incorporated into the input prompts by targeting to reduce potential hallucinations. The resulting dataset builds upon open access dermatological image repositories (DERM12345, BCN20000, PAD-UFES-20, SCIN, and HIBA) that have permissive CC-BY-4.0 licenses. We also fine-tuned a preliminary Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model, DermatoLlama 1.0, on 5,000 samples. We anticipate this dataset to support and accelerate AI research in dermatology.

Abstract: Social media has become an important source for understanding mental health, providing researchers with a way to detect conditions like depression from user-generated posts. This tutorial provides practical guidance to address common challenges in applying machine learning and deep learning methods for mental health detection on these platforms. It focuses on strategies for working with diverse datasets, improving text preprocessing, and addressing issues such as imbalanced data and model evaluation. Real-world examples and step-by-step instructions demonstrate how to apply these techniques effectively, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and ethical considerations.

      <description>arXiv:2502.07273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that variational learning naturally induces an adaptive label smoothing where label noise is specialized for each example. Such label-smoothing is useful to handle examples with labeling errors and distribution shifts, but designing a good adaptivity strategy is not always easy. We propose to skip this step and simply use the natural adaptivity induced during the optimization of a variational objective. We show empirical results where a variational algorithm called IVON outperforms traditional label smoothing and yields adaptivity strategies similar to those of an existing approach. By connecting Bayesian methods to label smoothing, our work provides a new way to handle overconfident predictions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Weak-to-Strong Generalization in Theory and Practice: Reverse KL vs. Forward KL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models advance toward superhuman performance, ensuring their alignment with human values and abilities grows increasingly complex. Weak-to-strong generalization offers a promising approach by leveraging predictions from weaker models to guide stronger systems, but its effectiveness could be constrained by the inherent noise and inaccuracies in these weak predictions. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that replaces forward KL divergence-whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting to imperfect weak signals-with reverse KL divergence. Reverse KL divergence's zero-forcing effect prioritizes high-confidence predictions, effectively mitigating the influence of unreliable weak supervision. Theoretically, we extend existing bounds and derive tighter lower bounds for both forward and reverse KL divergence, establishing that reverse KL achieves at least comparable guarantees to forward KL. Notably, when a sufficiently pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned on the last linear layer, reverse KL guarantees that it outperforms its weak supervisor by the magnitude of their disagreement. Empirically, we demonstrate that reverse KL and reverse cross-entropy enable strong models to successfully outperform those trained with forward KL and standard cross-entropy across most settings, highlighting the practical advantages of these reverse losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize a novel modeling framework for achieving interpretability in deep learning, anchored in the principle of inference equivariance. While the direct verification of interpretability scales exponentially with the number of variables of the system, we show that this complexity can be mitigated by treating interpretability as a Markovian property and employing neural re-parametrization techniques. Building on these insights, we propose a new modeling paradigm -- neural generation and interpretable execution -- that enables scalable verification of equivariance. This paradigm provides a general approach for designing Neural Interpretable Reasoners that are not only expressive but also transparent.</description>

      <title>LegalCore: A Dataset for Legal Documents Event Coreference Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing events and their coreferential mentions in a document is essential for understanding semantic meanings of text. The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamic Diffusion Process of LLM-based Agents under Information Asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we study the dynamics of information diffusion in 12 asymmetric open environments defined by information content and distribution mechanisms. We first present a general framework to capture the features of information diffusion. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of LLM-based attention. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we observe the emergence of information cocoons, the evolution of information gaps, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</description>

The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a pivotal task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requiring models to understand and reason about visual content in response to natural language questions. Analyzing VQA datasets is essential for developing robust models that can handle the complexities of multimodal reasoning. Several approaches have been developed to examine these datasets, each offering distinct perspectives on question diversity, answer distribution, and visual-textual correlations. Despite significant progress, existing VQA models face challenges related to dataset bias, limited model complexity, commonsense reasoning gaps, rigid evaluation methods, and generalization to real world scenarios. This paper offers a detailed study of the original VQA dataset, baseline models and methods along with a comparative study of five advanced VQA models, ABC-CNN, KICNLE, Masked Vision and Language Modeling, BLIP-2, and OFA, each employing distinct methods to address these ongoing challenges.</description>

      <title>Lightweight yet Efficient: An External Attentive Graph Convolutional Network with Positional Prompts for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based Sequential Recommender systems (GSRs) have gained significant research attention due to their ability to simultaneously handle user-item interactions and sequential relationships between items. Current GSRs often utilize composite or in-depth structures for graph encoding (e.g., the Graph Transformer). Nevertheless, they have high computational complexity, hindering the deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Moreover, the relative position encoding in Graph Transformer has difficulty in considering the complicated positional dependencies within sequence. To this end, we propose an External Attentive Graph convolutional network with Positional prompts for Sequential recommendation, namely EA-GPS. Specifically, we first introduce an external attentive graph convolutional network that linearly measures the global associations among nodes via two external memory units. Then, we present a positional prompt-based decoder that explicitly treats the absolute item positions as external prompts. By introducing length-adaptive sequential masking and a soft attention network, such a decoder facilitates the model to capture the long-term positional dependencies and contextual relationships within sequences. Extensive experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed EA-GPS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, it achieves the superior performance while maintaining a smaller parameter size and lower training overhead. The implementation of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ZZY-GraphMiningLab/EA-GPS.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR): A New Benchmark for Multimodal Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</description>

      <title>Tool or Tutor? Experimental evidence from AI deployment in cancer diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Professionals increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities and assist with task execution. While prior research has examined these uses separately, their potential interaction remains underexplored. We propose that AI-driven training ("tutor" effect) and AI-assisted task completion ("tool" effect) can be complementary and test this hypothesis in the context of lung cancer diagnosis. In a field experiment with 336 medical students, we manipulated AI deployment in training, in practice, and in both. Our findings reveal that while AI-integrated training and AI assistance independently improved diagnostic performance, their combination yielded the highest accuracy. These results underscore AI's dual role in enhancing human performance through both learning and real-time support, offering insights into AI deployment in professional settings where human expertise remains essential.</description>

      <title>Unposed Sparse Views Room Layout Reconstruction in the Age of Pretrain Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Room layout estimation from multiple-perspective images is poorly investigated due to the complexities that emerge from multi-view geometry, which requires muti-step solutions such as camera intrinsic and extrinsic estimation, image matching, and triangulation. However, in 3D reconstruction, the advancement of recent 3D foundation models such as DUSt3R has shifted the paradigm from the traditional multi-step structure-from-motion process to an end-to-end single-step approach. To this end, we introduce Plane-DUSt3R, a novel method for multi-view room layout estimation leveraging the 3D foundation model DUSt3R. Plane-DUSt3R incorporates the DUSt3R framework and fine-tunes on a room layout dataset (Structure3D) with a modified objective to estimate structural planes. By generating uniform and parsimonious results, Plane-DUSt3R enables room layout estimation with only a single post-processing step and 2D detection results. Unlike previous methods that rely on single-perspective or panorama image, Plane-DUSt3R extends the setting to handle multiple-perspective images. Moreover, it offers a streamlined, end-to-end solution that simplifies the process and reduces error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that Plane-DUSt3R not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the synthetic dataset but also proves robust and effective on in the wild data with different image styles such as cartoon.

      <title>Large Language Models are Powerful EHR Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>External Large Foundation Model: How to Efficiently Serve Trillions of Parameters for Online Ads Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ads recommendation is a prominent service of online advertising systems and has been actively studied. Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</description>

      <title>SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition with Uninterrupted Retention and Low-Rank Adaptation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models is becoming increasingly infeasible due to high computational demands. Moreover, FT also increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. By fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, LoRA achieves performance similar to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting still remains. To address these limitations, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel PEFT variant designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a novel normalization technique, Sigmoid-based Magnitude Norm (S-MagNorm), which enhances parameter retention and fine-tuning efficiency. SECURA has been evaluated on a diverse range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), complex question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four MCQ tasks and 2.51% across five QA tasks on Gemma2 2B, Qwen2 1.5B, Qwen2 7B, Llama3 8B, and Llama3.1 8B, outperforming DoRA. Additionally, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 16 continual learning tests and maintaining more than 70% accuracy on LLMs' basic knowledge compared to Experience Replay (ER), sequential learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is an emerging yet challenging task that allows users to search for target images using a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text specifying the user's desired changes to the reference image. Given its significant academic and practical value, CIR has become a rapidly growing area of interest in the computer vision and machine learning communities, particularly with the advances in deep learning. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive review of CIR to provide a timely overview of this field. Therefore, we synthesize insights from over 120 publications in top conferences and journals, including ACM TOIS, SIGIR, and CVPR In particular, we systematically categorize existing supervised CIR and zero-shot CIR models using a fine-grained taxonomy. For a comprehensive review, we also briefly discuss approaches for tasks closely related to CIR, such as attribute-based CIR and dialog-based CIR. Additionally, we summarize benchmark datasets for evaluation and analyze existing supervised and zero-shot CIR methods by comparing experimental results across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we present promising future directions in this field, offering practical insights for researchers interested in further exploration. The curated collection of related works is maintained and continuously updated in https://github.com/haokunwen/Awesome-Composed-Image-Retrieval.</description>

      <title>Assistance or Disruption? Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</description>

      <title>Comet: Fine-grained Computation-communication Overlapping for Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been extensively employed to scale large language models to trillion-plus parameters while maintaining a fixed computational cost. The development of large MoE models in the distributed scenario encounters the problem of large communication overhead. The inter-device communication of a MoE layer can occupy 47% time of the entire model execution with popular models and frameworks. Therefore, existing methods suggest the communication in a MoE layer to be pipelined with the computation for overlapping. However, these coarse grained overlapping schemes introduce a notable impairment of computational efficiency and the latency concealing is sub-optimal.
  To this end, we present COMET, an optimized MoE system with fine-grained communication-computation overlapping. Leveraging data dependency analysis and task rescheduling, COMET achieves precise fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation. Through adaptive workload assignment, COMET effectively eliminates fine-grained communication bottlenecks and enhances its adaptability across various scenarios. Our evaluation shows that COMET accelerates the execution of a single MoE layer by $1.96\times$ and for end-to-end execution, COMET delivers a $1.71\times$ speedup on average. COMET has been adopted in the production environment of clusters with ten-thousand-scale of GPUs, achieving savings of millions of GPU hours.</description>

      <title>WalnutData: A UAV Remote Sensing Dataset of Green Walnuts and Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UAV technology is gradually maturing and can provide extremely powerful support for smart agriculture and precise monitoring. Currently, there is no dataset related to green walnuts in the field of agricultural computer vision. Thus, in order to promote the algorithm design in the field of agricultural computer vision, we used UAV to collect remote-sensing data from 8 walnut sample plots. Considering that green walnuts are subject to various lighting conditions and occlusion, we constructed a large-scale dataset with a higher-granularity of target features - WalnutData. This dataset contains a total of 30,240 images and 706,208 instances, and there are 4 target categories: being illuminated by frontal light and unoccluded (A1), being backlit and unoccluded (A2), being illuminated by frontal light and occluded (B1), and being backlit and occluded (B2). Subsequently, we evaluated many mainstream algorithms on WalnutData and used these evaluation results as the baseline standard. The dataset and all evaluation results can be obtained at https://github.com/1wuming/WalnutData.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Generated Korean Text through Linguistic Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_generated_korean_text_through_linguistic_analysis.</description>

      <title>VOILA: Evaluation of MLLMs For Perceptual Understanding and Analogical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a powerful tool for integrating visual and textual information. Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since 2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy objectives.</description>

      <title>Shifting Power: Leveraging LLMs to Simulate Human Aversion in ABMs of Bilateral Financial Exchanges, A bond market study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.</description>

      <title>Smoothing Grounding and Reasoning for MLLM-Powered GUI Agents with Query-Oriented Pivot Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning ( RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO ( LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Fence Theorem: Towards Dual-Objective Semantic-Structure Isolation in Preprocessing Phase for 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (AD) is prominent but difficult due to lacking a unified theoretical foundation for preprocessing design. We establish the Fence Theorem, formalizing preprocessing as a dual-objective semantic isolator: (1) mitigating cross-semantic interference to the greatest extent feasible and (2) confining anomaly judgments to aligned semantic spaces wherever viable, thereby establishing intra-semantic comparability. Any preprocessing approach achieves this goal through a two-stage process of Emantic-Division and Spatial-Constraints stage. Through systematic deconstruction, we theoretically and experimentally subsume existing preprocessing methods under this theorem via tripartite evidence: qualitative analyses, quantitative studies, and mathematical proofs. Guided by the Fence Theorem, we implement Patch3D, consisting of Patch-Cutting and Patch-Matching modules, to segment semantic spaces and consolidate similar ones while independently modeling normal features within each space. Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD with different settings demonstrate that progressively finer-grained semantic alignment in preprocessing directly enhances point-level AD accuracy, providing inverse validation of the theorem's causal logic.</description>

      <title>Tera-MIND: Tera-scale mouse brain simulation via spatial mRNA-guided diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holistic 3D modeling of molecularly defined brain structures is crucial for understanding complex brain functions. Emerging tissue profiling technologies enable the construction of a comprehensive atlas of the mammalian brain with sub-cellular resolution and spatially resolved gene expression data. However, such tera-scale volumetric datasets present significant computational challenges in understanding complex brain functions within their native 3D spatial context. Here, we propose the novel generative approach $\textbf{Tera-MIND}$, which can simulate $\textbf{Tera}$-scale $\textbf{M}$ouse bra$\textbf{IN}$s in 3D using a patch-based and boundary-aware $\textbf{D}$iffusion model. Taking spatial transcriptomic data as the conditional input, we generate virtual mouse brains with comprehensive cellular morphological detail at teravoxel scale. Through the lens of 3D $gene$-$gene$ self-attention, we identify spatial molecular interactions for key transcriptomic pathways in the murine brain, exemplified by glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems. Importantly, these $in$-$silico$ biological findings are consistent and reproducible across three tera-scale virtual mouse brains. Therefore, Tera-MIND showcases a promising path toward efficient and generative simulations of whole organ systems for biomedical research.

      <description>arXiv:2503.01450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce POPGym Arcade, a benchmark consisting of 7 pixel-based environments each with three difficulties, utilizing a single observation and action space. Each environment offers both fully observable and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. POPGym Arcade utilizes JIT compilation on hardware accelerators to achieve substantial speedups over CPU-bound environments. Moreover, this enables Podracer-style architectures to further increase hardware utilization and training speed. We evaluate memory models on our environments using a Podracer variant of Q learning, and examine the results. Finally, we generate memory saliency maps, uncovering how memories propagate through policies. Our library is available at https://github.com/bolt-research/popgym_arcade.</description>

      <title>SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</description>
