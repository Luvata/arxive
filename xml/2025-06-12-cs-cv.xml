      <title>Toward Reliable AR-Guided Surgical Navigation: Interactive Deformation Modeling with Data-Driven Biomechanics and Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08048v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.</description>

      <title>ReCogDrive: A Reinforced Cognitive Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6 and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA by 5.6 PDMS.</description>

      <title>CuRe: Cultural Gaps in the Long Tail of Text-to-Image Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes (food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders (SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0, and DALL-E 3. The code and dataset is open-sourced and available at https://aniketrege.github.io/cure/.</description>

      <title>IGraSS: Learning to Identify Infrastructure Networks from Satellite Imagery by Iterative Graph-constrained Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08137v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral Domain Neural Reconstruction for Passband FMCW Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.</description>

      <title>Surgeon Style Fingerprinting and Privacy Risk Quantification via Discrete Diffusion Models in a Vision-Language-Action Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training, experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

      <title>Open World Scene Graph Generation using Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG, a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without task-level training.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of Differentiable Object Models for Compositional Interpretation of Complex Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors (DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation, and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space, but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach, we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training, and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the ways in which they can be addressed.</description>

      <title>GIQ: Benchmarking 3D Geometric Reasoning of Vision Foundation Models with Simulated and Real Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08194v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Decoder-Only LLMs for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12 different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced visio-linguistic reasoning skills.</description>

      <title>Using Satellite Images And Self-supervised Machine Learning Networks To Detect Water Hidden Under Vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance. Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.</description>

      <title>Jamais Vu: Exposing the Generalization Gap in Supervised Semantic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different datasets.</description>

      <title>A Good CREPE needs more than just Sugar: Investigating Biases in Compositional Vision-Language Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less prone to such simple attacks.</description>

      <title>Highly Compressed Tokenizer Can Generate Without Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.</description>

      <title>Seeing Voices: Generating A-Roll Video from Audio with Mirage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).</description>

      <title>SEMA: a Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention via Token Localization and Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.</description>

      <title>OpenRR-1k: A Scalable Dataset for Real-World Reflection Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective. Our approach is convenient, cost-effective, and scalable, while ensuring that the collected data pairs are of high quality, perfectly aligned, and represent natural and diverse scenarios. Following this paradigm, we collect a Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-1k.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Classification via Transformer-based Spectral-Spatial Attention Decoupling and Adaptive Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08324v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.</description>

      <title>Locating Tennis Ball Impact on the Racket in Real Time Using an Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact, and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>How Much To Guide: Revisiting Adaptive Guidance in Classifier-Free Guidance Text-to-Vision Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models, classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>MedMoE: Modality-Specialized Mixture of Experts for Medical Vision-Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08356v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction, overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type, which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions, without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.</description>

      <title>Image Demoir\'eing Using Dual Camera Fusion on Mobile Phones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.</description>

      <title>SECOND: Mitigating Perceptual Hallucination in Vision-Language Models via Selective and Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information, facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting across scales outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>RadioDUN: A Physics-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio map represents the spatial distribution of spectrum resources within a region, supporting efficient resource allocation and interference mitigation. However, it is difficult to construct a dense radio map as a limited number of samples can be measured in practical scenarios. While existing works have used deep learning to estimate dense radio maps from sparse samples, they are hard to integrate with the physical characteristics of the radio map. To address this challenge, we cast radio map estimation as the sparse signal recovery problem. A physical propagation model is further incorporated to decompose the problem into multiple factor optimization sub-problems, thereby reducing recovery complexity. Inspired by the existing compressive sensing methods, we propose the Radio Deep Unfolding Network (RadioDUN) to unfold the optimization process, achieving adaptive parameter adjusting and prior fitting in a learnable manner. To account for the radio propagation characteristics, we develop a dynamic reweighting module (DRM) to adaptively model the importance of each factor for the radio map. Inspired by the shadowing factor in the physical propagation model, we integrate obstacle-related factors to express the obstacle-induced signal stochastic decay. The shadowing loss is further designed to constrain the factor prediction and act as a supplementary supervised objective, which enhances the performance of RadioDUN. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Better Reasoning with Less Data: Enhancing VLMs Through Unified Modality Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest, which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text multimodal task into a unified text modality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Motion Dynamics of Image-to-Video Models via Adaptive Low-Pass Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability, recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this, we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant drop in video quality or image fidelity.</description>

      <title>MARMOT: Masked Autoencoder for Modeling Transient Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.</description>

      <title>Context-aware TFL: A Universal Context-aware Contrastive Learning Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most research efforts in the multimedia forensics domain have focused on detecting forgery audio-visual content and reached sound achievements. However, these works only consider deepfake detection as a classification task and ignore the case where partial segments of the video are tampered with. Temporal forgery localization (TFL) of small fake audio-visual clips embedded in real videos is still challenging and more in line with realistic application scenarios. To resolve this issue, we propose a universal context-aware contrastive learning framework (UniCaCLF) for TFL. Our approach leverages supervised contrastive learning to discover and identify forged instants by means of anomaly detection, allowing for the precise localization of temporal forged segments. To this end, we propose a novel context-aware perception layer that utilizes a heterogeneous activation operation and an adaptive context updater to construct a context-aware contrastive objective, which enhances the discriminability of forged instant features by contrasting them with genuine instant features in terms of their distances to the global context. An efficient context-aware contrastive coding is introduced to further push the limit of instant feature distinguishability between genuine and forged instants in a supervised sample-by-sample manner, suppressing the cross-sample influence to improve temporal forgery localization performance. Extensive experimental results over five public datasets demonstrate that our proposed UniCaCLF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Robust Visual Localization via Semantic-Guided Multi-Scale Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>LiftVSR: Lifting Image Diffusion to Video Super-Resolution via Hybrid Temporal Modeling with Only 4$\times$RTX 4090s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>TrajFlow: Multi-modal Motion Prediction via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Spectral Principal Paths: How Deep Networks Distill Linear Representations from Noisy Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Graphs: using Scene and Knowledge Graphs for HD-EPIC VQA Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents SceneNet and KnowledgeNet, our approaches developed for the HD-EPIC VQA Challenge 2025. SceneNet leverages scene graphs generated with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to capture fine-grained object interactions, spatial relationships, and temporally grounded events. In parallel, KnowledgeNet incorporates ConceptNet's external commonsense knowledge to introduce high-level semantic connections between entities, enabling reasoning beyond directly observable visual evidence. Each method demonstrates distinct strengths across the seven categories of the HD-EPIC benchmark, and their combination within our framework results in an overall accuracy of 44.21% on the challenge, highlighting its effectiveness for complex egocentric VQA tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Subject EMG Pattern Recognition via Dual-Branch Adversarial Feature Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model's potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer for Class Incremental Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.</description>

      <title>Generating Vision-Language Navigation Instructions Incorporated Fine-Grained Alignment Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate environments by integrating visual perception and natural language instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories, which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation, and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction for Efficient Large Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters.
To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/DGMR.</description>

      <title>Transformers Meet Hyperspectral Imaging: A Comprehensive Study of Models, Challenges and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction, multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles: scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models, illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining, or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for next-generation HSI applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Class-wise Fair Adversarial Training via Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness. Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes. Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of robustness and fairness.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Challenges in Visual Inductive Priors: A Retrospective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well. In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges. These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some entries.</description>

      <title>SAMSelect: A Spectral Index Search for Marine Debris Visualization using Segment Anything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for photo-interpretation.
  We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation, especially in the marine field.</description>

      <title>A Probability-guided Sampler for Neural Implicit Surface Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.</description>

      <title>ECMNet:Lightweight Semantic Segmentation with Efficient CNN-Mamba Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.</description>

      <title>RoboSwap: A GAN-driven Video Diffusion Framework For Unsupervised Robot Arm Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</description>

      <title>SurfR: Surface Reconstruction with Multi-scale Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results.</description>

      <title>Orientation Matters: Making 3D Generative Models Orientation-Aligned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image, guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data, limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches. Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Video Memorability Prediction with Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss and Its Application in Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable. Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video memorability prediction.</description>

      <title>Beyond Calibration: Physically Informed Learning for Raw-to-Raw Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08650v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight, physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across different sensors and optical systems.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-c: Continual Improved Visual Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance, neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions, which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>ATAS: Any-to-Any Self-Distillation for Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.</description>

      <title>CanadaFireSat: Toward high-resolution wildfire forecasting with multiple modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions. Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models, aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim 0.1${\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada, leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution and continental scale.</description>

      <title>VReST: Enhancing Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models through Tree Search and Self-Reward Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques. In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms. VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues, all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <title>MoSiC: Optimal-Transport Motion Trajectory for Dense Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/SMSD75/MoSiC/tree/main</description>

      <title>TraGraph-GS: Trajectory Graph-based Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary Large-Scale Scene Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>SceneSplat++: A Large Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark for Language Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Geometric deep learning for local growth prediction on abdominal aortic aneurysm surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08729v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.</description>

      <title>InceptionMamba: An Efficient Hybrid Network with Large Band Convolution and Bottleneck Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Wake1021/InceptionMamba.</description>

      <title>RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08772v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</description>

      <title>Gaussian2Scene: 3D Scene Representation Learning via Self-supervised Learning with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08777v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth imagery. However, the lack of benchmarks for this data constrains progress towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.</description>

      <title>HomographyAD: Deep Anomaly Detection Using Self Homography Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data, which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances. However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method. In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>A PDE-Based Image Dehazing Method via Atmospheric Scattering Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. By integrating the atmospheric scattering model with nonlocal regularization and dark channel prior, we propose the improved PDE: \[ -\text{div}\left(D(\nabla u)\nabla u\right) + \lambda(t) G(u) = \Phi(I,t,A) \] where $D(\nabla u) = (|\nabla u| + \epsilon)^{-1}$ is the edge-preserving diffusion coefficient, $G(u)$ is the Gaussian convolution operator, and $\lambda(t)$ is the adaptive regularization parameter based on transmission map $t$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ using Lax-Milgram theorem, and implement an efficient fixed-point iteration scheme accelerated by PyTorch GPU computation. The experimental results demonstrate that this method is a promising deghazing solution that can be generalized to the deep model paradigm.</description>

      <title>Flow Diverse and Efficient: Learning Momentum Flow Matching via Stochastic Velocity Field Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast, and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns, which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'') to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution $p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

      <title>HunyuanVideo-HOMA: Generic Human-Object Interaction in Multimodal Driven Human Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation -- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework. HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally, HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

      <title>HiSin: Efficient High-Resolution Sinogram Inpainting via Resolution-Guided Progressive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting via resolution-guided progressive inference. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. It further incorporates frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 31.25% and inference time by up to 18.15%, and maintains inpainting accuracy across datasets, resolutions, and mask conditions.</description>

      <title>Video-CoT: A Comprehensive Dataset for Spatiotemporal Understanding of Videos Based on Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08817v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video content comprehension is essential for various applications, ranging from video analysis to interactive systems. Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities. By making these resources publicly available, we aim to encourage further exploration in this critical area. Project website:https://video-cot.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>CulturalFrames: Assessing Cultural Expectation Alignment in Text-to-Image Models and Evaluation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Adapting Vision-Language Foundation Model for Next Generation Medical Ultrasound Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08849v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

      <title>Spatial Transcriptomics Expression Prediction from Histopathology Based on Cross-Modal Mask Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.</description>

      <title>StreamSplat: Towards Online Dynamic 3D Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Video Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nickwzk/StreamSplat.</description>

      <title>DiscoVLA: Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment for Parameter-Efficient Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1.

      <title>Product of Experts for Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.</description>

      <title>WetCat: Automating Skill Assessment in Wetlab Cataract Surgery Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn66401174/files.</description>

      <title>MIRAGE: Multimodal foundation model and benchmark for comprehensive retinal OCT image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08900v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available: https://github.com/j-morano/MIRAGE.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Dual Feature Augmentation for Open-Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.</description>

      <title>SkipVAR: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Adaptive Frequency-Aware Skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08908v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.</description>

      <title>Inherently Faithful Attention Maps for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Socratic-MCTS: Test-Time Visual Reasoning by Asking the Right Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.</description>

      <title>What Limits Virtual Agent Application? OmniBench: A Scalable Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Essential Virtual Agent Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements. Our project is available at https://omni-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>SSS: Semi-Supervised SAM-2 with Efficient Prompting for Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models (e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong" consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data, fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably, SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/SSS.</description>

      <title>Cross-Spectral Body Recognition with Side Information Embedding: Benchmarks on LLCM and Analyzing Range-Induced Occlusions on IJB-MDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral evaluations.</description>

      <title>Segment Concealed Objects with Incomplete Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance improvement on the DOTA dataset.</description>

      <title>ORIDa: Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale, real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background) image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.</description>

      <title>ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model using LLMs for Context-Aware Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Range-View LiDAR Segmentation in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Medical Vision-Language Alignment Through Adapting Masked Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding.

      <title>Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.</description>

      <title>SDTagNet: Leveraging Text-Annotated Navigation Maps for Online HD Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

      <title>Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09022v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab</description>

      <title>DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

      <title>Diffuse and Disperse: Image Generation with Representation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</description>

      <title>Princeton365: A Diverse Dataset with Accurate Camera Pose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Princeton365, a large-scale diverse dataset of 365 videos with accurate camera pose. Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE), allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with 360-degree camera trajectories.

      <title>Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.</description>

      <title>Cosmos-Drive-Dreams: Scalable Synthetic Driving Data Generation with World Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.

      <title>MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.</description>

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.</description>

      <title>Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Partial Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level transport provides essential structure information for the class-level knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.</description>

      <title>Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08022v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Aligning Proteins and Language: A Foundation Model for Protein Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of protein structures derived by structural determination methods like cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning 3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning. For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000 protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for structure-function understanding in protein biology.</description>

      <title>Neural-Augmented Kelvinlet: Real-Time Soft Tissue Deformation with Multiple Graspers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft tissue simulation in surgical applications.</description>

      <title>A Real-time 3D Desktop Display</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new extended version of the altiro3D C++ Library -- initially developed to get glass-free holographic displays starting from 2D images -- is here introduced aiming to deal with 3D video streams from either 2D webcam images or flat video files. These streams are processed in real-time to synthesize light-fields (in Native format) and feed realistic 3D experiences. The core function needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a single 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied to improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus, altiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a Desktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats, etc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be selected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such as Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a Desktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has been also implemented.

      <title>UniVarFL: Uniformity and Variance Regularized Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work, we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions, effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in resource-constrained settings.

      <title>A System for Accurate Tracking and Video Recordings of Rodent Eye Movements using Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in neuroscience and vision science relies heavily on careful measurements of animal subject's gaze direction. Rodents are the most widely studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms, unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g., variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible, robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming medicine, with generative AI models like ChatGPT reshaping perceptions of its potential. This study examines surgeons' awareness, expectations, and involvement with AI in surgery through comparative surveys conducted in 2021 and 2024. Two cross-sectional surveys were distributed globally in 2021 and 2024, the first before an IRCAD webinar and the second during the annual EAES meeting. The surveys assessed demographics, AI awareness, expectations, involvement, and ethics (2024 only). The surveys collected a total of 671 responses from 98 countries, 522 in 2021 and 149 in 2024. Awareness of AI courses rose from 14.5% in 2021 to 44.6% in 2024, while course attendance increased from 12.9% to 23%. Despite this, familiarity with foundational AI concepts remained limited. Expectations for AI's role shifted in 2024, with hospital management gaining relevance. Ethical concerns gained prominence, with 87.2% of 2024 participants emphasizing accountability and transparency. Infrastructure limitations remained the primary obstacle to implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration and structured training were identified as critical for successful AI adoption. Optimism about AI's transformative potential remained high, with 79.9% of respondents believing AI would positively impact surgery and 96.6% willing to integrate AI into their clinical practice. Surgeons' perceptions of AI are evolving, driven by the rise of generative AI and advancements in surgical data science. While enthusiasm for integration is strong, knowledge gaps and infrastructural challenges persist. Addressing these through education, ethical frameworks, and infrastructure development is essential.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Tuned Video-Audio Models Elucidate Functional Specialization in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity. However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].</description>

      <title>Snap-and-tune: combining deep learning and test-time optimization for high-fidelity cardiovascular volumetric meshing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality volumetric meshing from medical images is a key bottleneck for physics-based simulations in personalized medicine. For volumetric meshing of complex medical structures, recent studies have often utilized deep learning (DL)-based template deformation approaches to enable fast test-time generation with high spatial accuracy. However, these approaches still exhibit limitations, such as limited flexibility at high-curvature areas and unrealistic inter-part distances. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective snap-and-tune strategy that sequentially applies DL and test-time optimization, which combines fast initial shape fitting with more detailed sample-specific mesh corrections. Our method provides significant improvements in both spatial accuracy and mesh quality, while being fully automated and requiring no additional training labels. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility and usefulness of our newly generated meshes via solid mechanics simulations in two different software platforms. Our code is available at https://github.com/danpak94/Deep-Cardiac-Volumetric-Mesh.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Articulated Object Reconstruction from Casually Captured RGBD Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life. Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the full properties of light, including both amplitude and phase, in 3D representations is crucial for advancing physically plausible rendering, particularly in holographic displays. To support these features, we propose a novel representation that optimizes 3D scenes without relying on intensity-based intermediaries. We reformulate 3D Gaussian splatting with complex-valued Gaussian primitives, expanding support for rendering with light waves. By leveraging RGBD multi-view images, our method directly optimizes complex-valued Gaussians as a 3D holographic scene representation. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive hologram re-optimization. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 30x-10,000x speed improvements while maintaining on-par image quality, representing a first step towards geometrically aligned, physically plausible holographic scene representations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates according to activation variance. Our method enhances the stability of neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization capabilities of SGD, all while maintaining competitive execution times.

      <title>Boosting Gradient Leakage Attacks: Data Reconstruction in Realistic FL Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among multiple clients without the need to expose raw data. Its ability to safeguard privacy, at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate, several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however, contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak, which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need for more effective defense methods.</description>

Abstract: While current AI illustration tools can generate high-quality images from text prompts, they rarely reveal the step-by-step procedure that human artists follow. We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative exploration and skills acquisition.</description>

      <title>Re-Thinking the Automatic Evaluation of Image-Text Alignment in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.</description>

      <title>FEDTAIL: Federated Long-Tailed Domain Generalization with Sharpness-Guided Gradient Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

      <title>Plug-and-Play Linear Attention for Pre-trained Image and Video Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) has become a core component in modern computer vision models. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to input length poses a significant computational bottleneck in real-time and resource constrained environments. We propose PnP-Nystra, a Nystr\"om based linear approximation of self-attention, developed as a plug-and-play (PnP) module that can be integrated into the pre-trained image and video restoration models without retraining. As a drop-in replacement for MHSA, PnP-Nystra enables efficient acceleration in various window-based transformer architectures, including SwinIR, Uformer, and RVRT. Our experiments across diverse image and video restoration tasks, including denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution, demonstrate that PnP-Nystra achieves a 2-4x speed-up on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU and a 2-5x speed-up on CPU inference. Despite these significant gains, the method incurs a maximum PSNR drop of only 1.5 dB across all evaluated tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate a linear attention functioning as a training-free substitute for MHSA in restoration models.</description>

      <title>DCD: A Semantic Segmentation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Four-Chamber View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber (A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise, anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.</description>

      <title>HSG-12M: A Large-Scale Spatial Multigraph Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Biologically Inspired Deep Learning Approaches for Fetal Ultrasound Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of second-trimester fetal ultrasound images remains challenging due to low image quality, high intra-class variability, and significant class imbalance. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful, biologically inspired deep learning ensemble framework that-unlike prior studies focused on only a handful of anatomical targets-simultaneously distinguishes 16 fetal structures. Drawing on the hierarchical, modular organization of biological vision systems, our model stacks two complementary branches (a "shallow" path for coarse, low-resolution cues and a "detailed" path for fine, high-resolution features), concatenating their outputs for final prediction. To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large number of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture. We trained and evaluated on 5,298 routinely acquired clinical images (annotated by three experts and reconciled via Dawid-Skene), reflecting real-world noise and variability rather than a "cleaned" dataset. Despite this complexity, our ensemble (EfficientNet-B0 + EfficientNet-B6 with LDAM-Focal loss) identifies 90% of organs with accuracy &gt; 0.75 and 75% of organs with accuracy &gt; 0.85-performance competitive with more elaborate models applied to far fewer categories. These results demonstrate that biologically inspired modular stacking can yield robust, scalable fetal anatomy recognition in challenging clinical settings.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC-F: A Framework for Enhancing Students' Oral Presentation Skills through Personalized Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral presentation skills.</description>

      <title>Time Series Representations for Classification Lie Hidden in Pretrained Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.</description>

      <title>MAMBO: High-Resolution Generative Approach for Mammography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08700v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support, refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons, and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models, including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning: even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to 77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3 and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.</description>

      <title>PhyBlock: A Progressive Benchmark for Physical Understanding and Planning via 3D Block Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Synthetic CT from CBCT via Multimodal Fusion: A Study on the Impact of CBCT Quality and Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for real-time intraoperative imaging due to its low radiation dose and high acquisition speed. However, despite its high resolution, CBCT suffers from significant artifacts and thereby lower visual quality, compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A recent approach to mitigate these artifacts is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, translating CBCT volumes into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning, integrating intraoperative CBCT with preoperative CT. Beyond validation on two real-world datasets, we use a versatile synthetic dataset, to analyze how CBCT-CT alignment and CBCT quality affect sCT quality. The results demonstrate that multimodal sCT consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with the most significant gains observed in well-aligned, low-quality CBCT-CT cases. Finally, we demonstrate that these findings are highly reproducible in real-world clinical datasets.</description>

      <title>Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transforms for Invariance and Robustness in Optimal Transport Based Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09023v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.</description>

      <title>VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</description>

      <title>StereoVAE: A lightweight stereo-matching system using embedded GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lightweight system for stereo matching through embedded GPUs. It breaks the trade-off between accuracy and processing speed in stereo matching, enabling our embedded system to further improve the matching accuracy while ensuring real-time processing. The main idea of our method is to construct a tiny neural network based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to upsample and refinement a small size of coarse disparity map, which is first generated by a traditional matching method. The proposed hybrid structure cannot only bring the advantage of traditional methods in terms of computational complexity, but also ensure the matching accuracy under the impact of neural network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 2015 benchmark demonstrate that our tiny system exhibits high robustness in improving the accuracy of the coarse disparity maps generated by different algorithms, while also running in real-time on embedded GPUs.</description>

      <title>Tile Classification Based Viewport Prediction with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewport prediction is a crucial aspect of tile-based 360 video streaming system. However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Prior Shape Bias in Point Clouds via Differentiable Center Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked autoencoding and generative pretraining have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing, and more recently, they have been extended to the point cloud domain. Nevertheless, existing point cloud models suffer from the issue of information leakage due to the pre-sampling of center points, which leads to trivial proxy tasks for the models. These approaches primarily focus on local feature reconstruction, limiting their ability to capture global patterns within point clouds. In this paper, we argue that the reduced difficulty of pretext tasks hampers the model's capacity to learn expressive representations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel solution called the Differentiable Center Sampling Network (DCS-Net). It tackles the information leakage problem by incorporating both global feature reconstruction and local feature reconstruction as non-trivial proxy tasks, enabling simultaneous learning of both the global and local patterns within point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the expressive capacity of existing point cloud models and effectively addresses the issue of information leakage.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Rationales for Explainable Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task of predicting the answer to a question about the content of an image. Prior works directly evaluate the answering models by simply calculating the accuracy of predicted answers. However, the inner reasoning behind the predictions is disregarded in such a "black box" system, and we cannot ascertain the trustworthiness of the predictions. Even more concerning, in some cases, these models predict correct answers despite focusing on irrelevant visual regions or textual tokens. To develop an explainable and trustworthy answering system, we propose a novel model termed MRVQA (Multimodal Rationales for VQA), which provides visual and textual rationales to support its predicted answers. To measure the quality of generated rationales, a new metric vtS (visual-textual Similarity) score is introduced from both visual and textual perspectives. Considering the extra annotations distinct from standard VQA, MRVQA is trained and evaluated using samples synthesized from some existing datasets. Extensive experiments across three EVQA datasets demonstrate that MRVQA achieves new state-of-the-art results through additional rationale generation, enhancing the trustworthiness of the explainable VQA model. The code and the synthesized dataset are released under https://github.com/lik1996/MRVQA2025.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Unsupervised Domain Generalization by Retrieving Across the Modality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model which generalizes to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the unsupervised domain generalization (MUDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be accurately and efficiently searched in a joint vision-language space. We make three contributions in the MUDG setting. Firstly, we show theoretically that cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search suffers from low recall due to the large distance between text queries and the image centroids used for coarse quantization. Accordingly, we propose paired k-means, a simple clustering algorithm that improves nearest neighbor recall by storing centroids in query space instead of image space. Secondly, we propose an adaptive text augmentation scheme for target labels designed to improve zero-shot accuracy and diversify retrieved image data. Lastly, we present two simple but effective components to further improve downstream target accuracy. We compare against state-of-the-art name-only transfer, source-free DG and zero-shot (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show consistent improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse datasets.

      <title>SMCD: High Realism Motion Style Transfer via Mamba-based Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion style transfer is a significant research direction in the field of computer vision, enabling virtual digital humans to rapidly switch between different styles of the same motion, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and realism of movements. It has been widely applied in multimedia scenarios such as films, games, and the metaverse. However, most existing methods adopt a two-stream structure, which tends to overlook the intrinsic relationship between content and style motions, leading to information loss and poor alignment. Moreover, when handling long-range motion sequences, these methods fail to effectively learn temporal dependencies, ultimately resulting in unnatural generated motions. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Motion Style Diffusion (UMSD) framework, which simultaneously extracts features from both content and style motions and facilitates sufficient information interaction. Additionally, we introduce the Motion Style Mamba (MSM) denoiser, the first approach in the field of motion style transfer to leverage Mamba's powerful sequence modelling capability. Better capturing temporal relationships generates more coherent stylized motion sequences. Third, we design a diffusion-based content consistency loss and a style consistency loss to constrain the framework, ensuring that it inherits the content motion while effectively learning the characteristics of the style motion. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving more realistic and coherent motion style transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current medical AI systems are often limited to narrow applications, hindering widespread adoption. We present MedVersa, a generalist foundation model trained on tens of millions of compiled medical instances. MedVersa unlocks generalist learning from multimodal inputs and outputs, representing the first example of a generalist model reaching competitive performance with leading specialized solutions across a variety of medical imaging scenarios. MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in nine tasks, sometimes outperforming counterparts by over 10%. Radiologist evaluation shows MedVersa-generated reports get superior performance in 95% of normal studies, while matching or exceeding human reports in 71% of cases overall. User studies showed notable reductions in report writing time and discrepancies with the use of MedVersa. Our findings underscore the value of flexible, multimodal AI systems in advancing medical image interpretation and supporting clinical expertise.</description>

      <title>Markerless Multi-view 3D Human Pose Estimation: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D human pose estimation involves reconstructing the human skeleton by detecting the body joints. Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose.
  Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Vision Transformer with Transfer Learning Combined with Support Vector Machine Based Efficient Drought Stress Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging. This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17059v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their parameter-intensive nature and reliance on large amounts of data for effective performance have shifted the focus from traditional human-annotated labels to unsupervised learning and pretraining strategies that uncover hidden structures within the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL leverages inherent relationships within the data itself as a form of supervision, eliminating the need for manual labeling and offering a more scalable and resource-efficient alternative for model training. Given these advantages, it is imperative to explore the integration of SSL techniques with ViTs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.</description>

      <title>NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.</description>

      <title>EVA: An Embodied World Model for Future Video Anticipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in simulating future states, showcasing their potential as world simulators in embodied scenarios. However, existing models often lack robust understanding, limiting their ability to perform multi-step predictions or handle Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the Reflection of Generation (RoG), a set of intermediate reasoning strategies designed to enhance video prediction. It leverages the complementary strengths of pre-trained vision-language and video generation models, enabling them to function as a world model in embodied scenarios. To support RoG, we introduce Embodied Video Anticipation Benchmark(EVA-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates embodied world models across diverse tasks and scenarios, utilizing both in-domain and OOD datasets. Building on this foundation, we devise a world model, Embodied Video Anticipator (EVA), that follows a multistage training paradigm to generate high-fidelity video frames and apply an autoregressive strategy to enable adaptive generalization for longer video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EVA in various downstream tasks like video generation and robotics, thereby paving the way for large-scale pre-trained models in real-world video prediction applications.

      <title>xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): You Only Need 32 Tokens to Represent a Video Even in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

      <title>UnCLe: Benchmarking Unsupervised Continual Learning for Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose UnCLe, the first standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal 3D reconstruction task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. While unsupervised learning of depth boasts the possibility continual learning of novel data distributions over time, existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel nonstationary distributions, they ``catastrophically forget'' previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models across indoor and outdoor environments, and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.</description>

      <title>Grouped Discrete Representation for Object-Centric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aims to discover objects in images or videos by reconstructing the input. Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability. The source code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/GroupedDiscreteRepresentation.</description>

      <title>Community Forensics: Using Thousands of Generators to Train Fake Image Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key challenges of detecting AI-generated images is spotting images that have been created by previously unseen generative models. We argue that the limited diversity of the training data is a major obstacle to addressing this problem, and we propose a new dataset that is significantly larger and more diverse than prior work. As part of creating this dataset, we systematically download thousands of text-to-image latent diffusion models and sample images from them. We also collect images from dozens of popular open source and commercial models. The resulting dataset contains 2.7M images that have been sampled from 4803 different models. These images collectively capture a wide range of scene content, generator architectures, and image processing settings. Using this dataset, we study the generalization abilities of fake image detectors. Our experiments suggest that detection performance improves as the number of models in the training set increases, even when these models have similar architectures. We also find that detection performance improves as the diversity of the models increases, and that our trained detectors generalize better than those trained on other datasets. The dataset can be found in https://jespark.net/projects/2024/community_forensics</description>

      <title>Autonomous Imagination: Closed-Loop Decomposition of Visual-to-Textual Conversion in Visual Reasoning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

      <title>SnapGen-V: Generating a Five-Second Video within Five Seconds on a Mobile Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</description>

      <title>A Culturally-Aware Benchmark for Person Re-Identification in Modest Attire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in surveillance and security. Despite progress in recent years, most existing ReID models often struggle to generalize across diverse cultural contexts, particularly in Islamic regions like Iran, where modest clothing styles are prevalent. Existing datasets predominantly feature Western and East Asian fashion, limiting their applicability in these settings. To address this gap, we introduce Iran University of Science and Technology Person Re-Identification (IUST_PersonReId), a dataset designed to reflect the unique challenges of ReID in new cultural environments, emphasizing modest attire and diverse scenarios from Iran, including markets, campuses, and mosques. Experiments on IUST_PersonReId with state-of-the-art models, such as Semantic Controllable Self-supervised Learning (SOLIDER) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Re-Identification (CLIP-ReID), reveal significant performance drops compared to benchmarks like Market1501 and Multi-Scene MultiTime (MSMT17), specifically, SOLIDER shows a drop of 50.75% and 23.01% Mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to Market1501 and MSMT17 respectively, while CLIP-ReID exhibits a drop of 38.09% and 21.74% mAP, highlighting the challenges posed by occlusion and limited distinctive features. Sequence-based evaluations show improvements by leveraging temporal context, emphasizing the dataset's potential for advancing culturally sensitive and robust ReID systems. IUST_PersonReId offers a critical resource for addressing fairness and bias in ReID research globally.</description>

      <title>TinyLLaVA-Video: Towards Smaller LMMs for Video Understanding with Group Resampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video behavior recognition and scene understanding are fundamental tasks in multimodal intelligence, serving as critical building blocks for numerous real-world applications. Through large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding, most existing open-source models rely on over 7B parameters and require large-scale datasets for training, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible to many researchers. Furthermore, lightweight models face persistent challenges in effectively processing long visual sequences and temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce TinyLLaVA-Video, a lightweight yet powerful video understanding model with approximately 3.6B parameters. The cornerstone of our design is the video-level group resampler, a novel mechanism that significantly reduces and controls the number of visual tokens at the video level. Unlike traditional image-level resampler, our approach effectively mitigates redundancy while enhancing temporal comprehension, leading to improved performance on video-based tasks. In addition, TinyLLaVA-Video demonstrates exceptional efficiency, requiring only one day of training on 8 A100-40G GPUs. It surpasses several existing 7B-parameter models on multiple benchmarks. We believe this work provides a valuable foundation for future research on lightweight video understanding models. The code and weights is available at https://github.com/ZhangXJ199/TinyLLaVA-Video.</description>

Abstract: Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding of human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent performance improvements across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment methods, participants, and brain imaging modalities</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</description>

Abstract: Retrieving images from the same location as a given query is an important component of multiple computer vision tasks, like Visual Place Recognition, Landmark Retrieval, Visual Localization, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline. The code for MegaLoc is available at https://github.com/gmberton/MegaLoc</description>

It significantly improves state-of-the-art Long Video Question Answering accuracy (up to 13.7%, and 16.9% on long videos) via redundancy minimization and structured textual representation for unified multi-modal reasoning</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative technique for representing multidimensional datasets using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. Our approach combines classical projection techniques with the explicit assignment of selected data dimensions to avatar (facial) features, leveraging the innate human ability to interpret facial traits. We introduce a semantic division of data dimensions into intuitive and technical categories, assigning the former to avatar features and projecting the latter into a four-dimensional (or higher) spatial embedding. The technique is implemented as a plugin for the open-source dpVision visualization platform, enabling users to interactively explore data in the form of a swarm of avatars whose spatial positions and visual features jointly encode various aspects of the dataset. Experimental results with synthetic test data and a 12-dimensional dataset of Portuguese Vinho Verde wines demonstrate that the proposed method enhances interpretability and facilitates the analysis of complex data structures.</description>

Abstract: Reconstructing spatially and temporally coherent videos from time-varying measurements is a fundamental challenge in many scientific domains. A major difficulty arises from the sparsity of measurements, which hinders accurate recovery of temporal dynamics. Existing image diffusion-based methods rely on extracting temporal consistency directly from measurements, limiting their effectiveness on scientific tasks with high spatiotemporal uncertainty. We address this difficulty by proposing a plug-and-play framework that incorporates a learned spatiotemporal diffusion prior. Due to its plug-and-play nature, our framework can be flexibly applied to different video inverse problems without the need for task-specific design and temporal heuristics. We further demonstrate that a spatiotemporal diffusion model can be trained efficiently with limited video data. We validate our approach on two challenging scientific video reconstruction tasks: black hole video reconstruction and dynamic MRI. While baseline methods struggle to provide temporally coherent reconstructions, our approach achieves significantly improved recovery of the spatiotemporal structure of the underlying ground truth videos.</description>

      <title>LMPOcc: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction Utilizing Long-Term Memory Prior from Historical Traversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.</description>

Abstract: The field of monocular depth estimation is continually evolving with the advent of numerous innovative models and extensions. However, research on monocular depth estimation methods specifically for underwater scenes remains limited, compounded by a scarcity of relevant data and methodological support. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the existing challenges in current monocular depth estimation methods for underwater environments. We construct an economically efficient dataset suitable for underwater scenarios by employing multi-view depth estimation to generate supervisory signals and corresponding enhanced underwater images. we introduces a texture-depth fusion module, designed according to the underwater optical imaging principles, which aims to effectively exploit and integrate depth information from texture cues. Experimental results on the FLSea dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of models in underwater settings. This work offers a cost-effective solution for monocular underwater depth estimation and holds considerable promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>SpatialReasoner: Towards Explicit and Generalizable 3D Spatial Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite recent advances on multi-modal models, 3D spatial reasoning remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models. Recent studies explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance by fine-tuning models on 3D-related visual question-answering data. However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner and often fail on questions that are trivial to humans, even with long chain-of-thought reasoning. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that addresses 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between multiple stages--3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and improves the generalization ability to novel question types. Furthermore, by analyzing the explicit 3D representations in multi-step reasoning traces of SpatialReasoner, we study the factual errors and identify key shortcomings of current LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieves improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.0 by 9.2% on 3DSRBench, and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>SpatialLLM: A Compound 3D-Informed Design towards Spatially-Intelligent Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.

      <title>CAD-Llama: Leveraging Large Language Models for Computer-Aided Design Parametric 3D Model Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas. This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.</description>

      <title>EAM: Enhancing Anything with Diffusion Transformers for Blind Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study, we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

      <title>How Do Images Align and Complement LiDAR? Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are publicly available at &lt;https://github.com/IMPL-Lab/IAL.git&gt;.</description>

      <title>ZigzagPointMamba: Spatial-Semantic Mamba for Point Cloud Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.</description>

      <title>Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

      <title>Revisiting Reweighted Risk for Calibration: AURC, Focal Loss, and Inverse Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors. We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of datasets and model architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating recipe images is a key challenge in food computing, with applications in culinary education and multimodal recipe assistants. However, existing datasets lack fine-grained alignment between recipe goals, step-wise instructions, and visual content. We present RecipeGen, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for recipe-based Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Video (I2V), and Text-to-Video (T2V) generation. RecipeGen contains 26,453 recipes, 196,724 images, and 4,491 videos, covering diverse ingredients, cooking procedures, styles, and dish types. We further propose domain-specific evaluation metrics to assess ingredient fidelity and interaction modeling, benchmark representative T2I, I2V, and T2V models, and provide insights for future recipe generation models.

      <title>From Generation to Generalization: Emergent Few-Shot Learning in Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools, capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</description>

      <title>CASE: Contrastive Activation for Saliency Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets, suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than existing methods.</description>

      <title>ARGUS: Hallucination and Omission Evaluation in Video-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships. Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video captioning performance.</description>

      <title>ArchiLense: A Framework for Quantitative Analysis of Architectural Styles Based on Vision Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.</description>

      <title>OneIG-Bench: Omni-dimensional Nuanced Evaluation for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.</description>

      <title>SK-VQA: Synthetic Knowledge Generation at Scale for Training Context-Augmented Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in domains such as knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA), where external knowledge is needed to answer a question. However, existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are not designed for context-augmented generation, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks. While synthetic data generation has recently gained attention for training MLLMs, its application for context-augmented generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SK-VQA, a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million visual question-answer pairs, each associated with context documents containing information necessary to determine the final answer. Compared to previous datasets, SK-VQA contains 11x more unique questions, exhibits greater domain diversity, and covers a broader spectrum of image sources. Through human evaluations, we confirm the high quality of the generated question-answer pairs and their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments show that SK-VQA serves both as a challenging KB-VQA benchmark and as an effective training resource for adapting MLLMs to context-augmented generation. Our results further indicate that models trained on SK-VQA demonstrate enhanced generalization in both context-aware VQA and multimodal RAG settings. SK-VQA is publicly available via Hugging Face Hub.</description>

      <title>Human-like object concept representations emerge naturally in multimodal large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple, training-free mechanism which explains the generalization behaviour of diffusion models. By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head Divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Predicates: Learning Symbolic World Models via Pretrained Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in complex robotics domains given low-level skills and a handful of short-horizon demonstrations containing sequences of images. To this end, we focus on learning abstract symbolic world models that facilitate zero-shot generalization to novel goals via planning. A critical component of such models is the set of symbolic predicates that define properties of and relationships between objects. In this work, we leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to propose a large set of visual predicates potentially relevant for decision-making, and to evaluate those predicates directly from camera images. At training time, we pass the proposed predicates and demonstrations into an optimization-based model-learning algorithm to obtain an abstract symbolic world model that is defined in terms of a compact subset of the proposed predicates. At test time, given a novel goal in a novel setting, we use the VLM to construct a symbolic description of the current world state, and then use a search-based planning algorithm to find a sequence of low-level skills that achieves the goal. We demonstrate empirically across experiments in both simulation and the real world that our method can generalize aggressively, applying its learned world model to solve problems with a wide variety of object types, arrangements, numbers of objects, and visual backgrounds, as well as novel goals and much longer horizons than those seen at training time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking and mapping in large-scale, unbounded outdoor environments using only monocular RGB input presents substantial challenges for existing SLAM systems. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

Abstract: How well can one expect transfer learning to work in a new setting where the domain is shifted, the task is different, and the architecture changes? Many transfer learning metrics have been proposed to answer this question. But how accurate are their predictions in a realistic new setting? We conducted an extensive evaluation involving over 42,000 experiments comparing 23 transferability metrics across 16 different datasets to assess their ability to predict transfer performance. Our findings reveal that none of the existing metrics perform well across the board. However, we find that a simple k-nearest neighbor evaluation -- as is commonly used to evaluate feature quality for self-supervision -- not only surpasses existing metrics, but also offers better computational efficiency and ease of implementation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive path planning for efficient object search by UAVs in agricultural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of localization errors, and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8 detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the field. When the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects, resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with a high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed finding non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy. The path planner is made available at https://github.com/wur-abe/uav_adaptive_planner.</description>

      <title>VIST-GPT: Ushering in the Era of Visual Storytelling with LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Decoding: An Attention-Inspired Adaptive Decoding Strategy to Mitigate Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/xlchen0205/MoD.</description>

      <title>RAVEN: Query-Guided Representation Alignment for Question Answering over Audio, Video, Embedded Sensors, and Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.</description>

      <title>Dual Attention Residual U-Net for Accurate Brain Ultrasound Segmentation in IVH Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

      <title>Estimation of Head Motion in Structural MRI and its Impact on Cortical Thickness Measurements in Retrospective Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion-related artifacts are inevitable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and can bias automated neuroanatomical metrics such as cortical thickness. These biases can interfere with statistical analysis which is a major concern as motion has been shown to be more prominent in certain populations such as children or individuals with ADHD. Manual review cannot objectively quantify motion in anatomical scans, and existing quantitative automated approaches often require specialized hardware or custom acquisition protocols. Here, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to estimate a summary motion metric in retrospective routine research scans by leveraging a large training dataset of synthetically motion-corrupted volumes. We validate our method with one held-out site from our training cohort and with 14 fully independent datasets, including one with manual ratings, achieving a representative $R^2 = 0.65$ versus manual labels and significant thickness-motion correlations in 12/15 datasets. Furthermore, our predicted motion correlates with subject age in line with prior studies. Our approach generalizes across scanner brands and protocols, enabling objective, scalable motion assessment in structural MRI studies without prospective motion correction. By providing reliable motion estimates, our method offers researchers a tool to assess and account for potential biases in cortical thickness analyses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Safety of Foundation Models for Visual Navigation through Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CARE (Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation), a plug-and-play module that enhances the safety of vision-based navigation without requiring additional range sensors or fine-tuning of pretrained models. While recent foundation models using only RGB inputs have shown strong performance, they often fail to generalize in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments with unseen objects or variations in camera parameters (e.g., field of view, pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, these models may generate unsafe trajectories that lead to collisions, requiring costly data collection and retraining. CARE addresses this limitation by seamlessly integrating with any RGB-based navigation system that outputs local trajectories, dynamically adjusting them using repulsive force vectors derived from monocular depth maps. We evaluate CARE by combining it with state-of-the-art vision-based navigation models across multiple robot platforms. CARE consistently reduces collision rates (up to 100%) without sacrificing goal-reaching performance and improves collision-free travel distance by up to 10.7x in exploration tasks.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive precision modulation of high-level neural population activity via natural vision perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally approached using invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.</description>

      <title>Meta-Adaptive Prompt Distillation for Few-Shot Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance, especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations, improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Lingshu: A Generalist Foundation Model for Unified Multimodal Medical Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</description>
