      <title>CortexCompile: Harnessing Cortical-Inspired Architectures for Enhanced Multi-Agent NLP Code Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to automated code generation often rely on monolithic models that lack real-time adaptability and scalability. This limitation is particularly evident in complex programming tasks that require dynamic adjustment and efficiency. The integration of neuroscience principles into Natural Language Processing (NLP) has the potential to revolutionize automated code generation. This paper presents CortexCompile, a novel modular system inspired by the specialized functions of the human brain's cortical regions. By emulating the distinct roles of the Prefrontal Cortex, Parietal Cortex, Temporal Lobe, and Motor Cortex, CortexCompile achieves significant advancements in scalability, efficiency, and adaptability compared to traditional monolithic models like GPT-4o. The system's architecture features a Task Orchestration Agent that manages dynamic task delegation and parallel processing, facilitating the generation of highly accurate and optimized code across increasingly complex programming tasks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CortexCompile consistently outperforms GPT-4o in development time, accuracy, and user satisfaction, particularly in tasks involving real-time strategy games and first-person shooters. These findings underscore the viability of neuroscience-inspired architectures in addressing the limitations of current NLP models, paving the way for more efficient and human-like AI systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Epilepsy Induced by Ischemic Hypoxic Brain Injury and Hypoglycemic Brain Injury using Multilevel Fusion of Data Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aims to investigate the similarities and differences in the brain damage caused by Hypoxia-Ischemia (HI), Hypoglycemia, and Epilepsy. Hypoglycemia poses a significant challenge in improving glycemic regulation for insulin-treated patients, while HI brain disease in neonates is associated with low oxygen levels. The study examines the possibility of using a combination of medical data and Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to predict outcomes over a two-year period. The study employs a multilevel fusion of data features to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. Therefore this paper suggests a hybridized classification model for Hypoxia-Ischemia and Hypoglycemia, Epilepsy brain injury (HCM-BI). A Support Vector Machine is applied with clinical details to define the Hypoxia-Ischemia outcomes of each infant. The newborn babies are assessed every two years again to know the neural development results. A selection of four attributes is derived from the Electroencephalography records, and SVM does not get conclusions regarding the classification of diseases. The final feature extraction of the EEG signal is optimized by the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to get the clear health condition of Hypoglycemia and Epilepsy patients. Through monitoring and assessing physical effects resulting from Electroencephalography, The Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) is used to extract the test samples with the most log data and to report hypoglycemia and epilepsy Keywords- Hypoxia-Ischemia , Hypoglycemia , Epilepsy , Multilevel Fusion of Data Features , Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) , Support Vector Machine (SVM)</description>

      <title>Meal-taking activity monitoring in the elderly based on sensor data: Comparison of unsupervised classification methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era marked by a demographic change towards an older population, there is an urgent need to improve nutritional monitoring in view of the increase in frailty. This research aims to enhance the identification of meal-taking activities by combining K-Means, GMM, and DBSCAN techniques. Using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) for the optimal meal taking activity clustering, the results show that K-Means seems to be the best solution, thanks to its unrivalled efficiency in data demarcation, compared with the capabilities of GMM and DBSCAN. Although capable of identifying complex patterns and outliers, the latter methods are limited by their operational complexities and dependence on precise parameter configurations. In this paper, we have processed data from 4 houses equipped with sensors. The findings indicate that applying the K-Means method results in high performance, evidenced by a particularly low Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), illustrating optimal cluster separation and cohesion. Calculating the average duration of each activity using the GMM algorithm allows distinguishing various categories of meal-taking activities. Alternatively, this can correspond to different times of the day fitting to each meal-taking activity. Using K-Means, GMM, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms, the study demonstrates an effective strategy for thoroughly understanding the data. This approach facilitates the comparison and selection of the most suitable method for optimal meal-taking activity clustering.</description>

      <title>SDOoop: Capturing Periodical Patterns and Out-of-phase Anomalies in Streaming Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming data analysis is increasingly required in applications, e.g., IoT, cybersecurity, robotics, mechatronics or cyber-physical systems. Despite its relevance, it is still an emerging field with open challenges. SDO is a recent anomaly detection method designed to meet requirements of speed, interpretability and intuitive parameterization. In this work, we present SDOoop, which extends the capabilities of SDO's streaming version to retain temporal information of data structures. SDOoop spots contextual anomalies undetectable by traditional algorithms, while enabling the inspection of data geometries, clusters and temporal patterns. We used SDOoop to model real network communications in critical infrastructures and extract patterns that disclose their dynamics. Moreover, we evaluated SDOoop with data from intrusion detection and natural science domains and obtained performances equivalent or superior to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show the high potential of new model-based methods to analyze and explain streaming data. Since SDOoop operates with constant per-sample space and time complexity, it is ideal for big data, being able to instantly process large volumes of information. SDOoop conforms to next-generation machine learning, which, in addition to accuracy and speed, is expected to provide highly interpretable and informative models.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detection in LLMs: Fast and Memory-Efficient Finetuned Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.</description>

      <title>NUMOSIM: A Synthetic Mobility Dataset with Anomaly Detection Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting real-world mobility data is challenging. It is often fraught with privacy concerns, logistical difficulties, and inherent biases. Moreover, accurately annotating anomalies in large-scale data is nearly impossible, as it demands meticulous effort to distinguish subtle and complex patterns. These challenges significantly impede progress in geospatial anomaly detection research by restricting access to reliable data and complicating the rigorous evaluation, comparison, and benchmarking of methodologies. To address these limitations, we introduce a synthetic mobility dataset, NUMOSIM, that provides a controlled, ethical, and diverse environment for benchmarking anomaly detection techniques. NUMOSIM simulates a wide array of realistic mobility scenarios, encompassing both typical and anomalous behaviours, generated through advanced deep learning models trained on real mobility data. This approach allows NUMOSIM to accurately replicate the complexities of real-world movement patterns while strategically injecting anomalies to challenge and evaluate detection algorithms based on how effectively they capture the interplay between demographic, geospatial, and temporal factors. Our goal is to advance geospatial mobility analysis by offering a realistic benchmark for improving anomaly detection and mobility modeling techniques. To support this, we provide open access to the NUMOSIM dataset, along with comprehensive documentation, evaluation metrics, and benchmark results.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. Many approaches have been developed but they can be divided into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and Decentralized training and execution (DTE).
  CTDE methods are the most common as they can use centralized information during training but execute in a decentralized manner -- using only information available to that agent during execution. CTDE is the only paradigm that requires a separate training phase where any available information (e.g., other agent policies, underlying states) can be used. As a result, they can be more scalable than CTE methods, do not require communication during execution, and can often perform well. CTDE fits most naturally with the cooperative case, but can be potentially applied in competitive or mixed settings depending on what information is assumed to be observed.
  This text is an introduction to CTDE in cooperative MARL. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods. It does not cover all work in CTDE MARL as the subarea is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the subarea and apologize to those that I have omitted.</description>

      <title>Better Verified Explanations with Applications to Incorrectness and Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on VeriX (Verified eXplainability, arXiv:2212.01051), a system for producing optimal verified explanations for machine learning model outputs, we present VeriX+, which significantly improves both the size and the generation time of verified explanations. We introduce a bound propagation-based sensitivity technique to improve the size, and a binary search-based traversal with confidence ranking for improving time -- the two techniques are orthogonal and can be used independently or together. We also show how to adapt the QuickXplain (Junker 2004) algorithm to our setting to provide a trade-off between size and time. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements on both metrics, e.g., a size reduction of 38% on the GTSRB dataset and a time reduction of 90% on MNIST. We also explore applications of our verified explanations and show that explanation size is a useful proxy for both incorrectness detection and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

      <title>Backdoor defense, learnability and obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formal notion of defendability against backdoors using a game between an attacker and a defender. In this game, the attacker modifies a function to behave differently on a particular input known as the "trigger", while behaving the same almost everywhere else. The defender then attempts to detect the trigger at evaluation time. If the defender succeeds with high enough probability, then the function class is said to be defendable. The key constraint on the attacker that makes defense possible is that the attacker's strategy must work for a randomly-chosen trigger.
  Our definition is simple and does not explicitly mention learning, yet we demonstrate that it is closely connected to learnability. In the computationally unbounded setting, we use a voting algorithm of Hanneke et al. (2022) to show that defendability is essentially determined by the VC dimension of the function class, in much the same way as PAC learnability. In the computationally bounded setting, we use a similar argument to show that efficient PAC learnability implies efficient defendability, but not conversely. On the other hand, we use indistinguishability obfuscation to show that the class of polynomial size circuits is not efficiently defendable. Finally, we present polynomial size decision trees as a natural example for which defense is strictly easier than learning. Thus, we identify efficient defendability as a notable intermediate concept in between efficient learnability and obfuscation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Interpretability in the Transformer to Automate the Proactive Scaling of Cloud Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web services adopt cloud-native principles to leverage the advantages of microservices. To consistently guarantee high Quality of Service (QoS) according to Service Level Agreements (SLAs), ensure satisfactory user experiences, and minimize operational costs, each microservice must be provisioned with the right amount of resources. However, accurately provisioning microservices with adequate resources is complex and depends on many factors, including workload intensity and the complex interconnections between microservices. To address this challenge, we develop a model that captures the relationship between an end-to-end latency, requests at the front-end level, and resource utilization. We then use the developed model to predict the end-to-end latency. Our solution leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), an attention-based architecture equipped with interpretability features. When the prediction results indicate SLA non-compliance, we use the feature importance provided by the TFT as covariates in Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), with the response variable being the desired latency, to learn the parameters associated with the feature importance. These learned parameters reflect the adjustments required to the features to ensure SLA compliance. We demonstrate the merit of our approach with a microservice-based application and provide a roadmap to deployment.</description>

      <title>The AdEMAMix Optimizer: Better, Faster, Older</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum based optimizers are central to a wide range of machine learning applications. These typically rely on an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of gradients, which decays exponentially the present contribution of older gradients. This accounts for gradients being local linear approximations which lose their relevance as the iterate moves along the loss landscape. This work questions the use of a single EMA to accumulate past gradients and empirically demonstrates how this choice can be sub-optimal: a single EMA cannot simultaneously give a high weight to the immediate past, and a non-negligible weight to older gradients. Building on this observation, we propose AdEMAMix, a simple modification of the Adam optimizer with a mixture of two EMAs to better take advantage of past gradients. Our experiments on language modeling and image classification show -- quite surprisingly -- that gradients can stay relevant for tens of thousands of steps. They help to converge faster, and often to lower minima: e.g., a $1.3$B parameter AdEMAMix LLM trained on $101$B tokens performs comparably to an AdamW model trained on $197$B tokens ($+95\%$). Moreover, our method significantly slows-down model forgetting during training. Our work motivates further exploration of different types of functions to leverage past gradients, beyond EMAs.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Cybersecurity: An Intelligent AutoML Framework for Autonomous Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile networks from 5G to 6G has necessitated the development of autonomous network management systems, such as Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs). However, the increased complexity and automation of these networks have also escalated cybersecurity risks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) leveraging traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown effectiveness in mitigating these risks, but they often require extensive manual effort and expert knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-based autonomous IDS framework towards achieving autonomous cybersecurity for next-generation networks. To achieve autonomous intrusion detection, the proposed AutoML framework automates all critical procedures of the data analytics pipeline, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensemble. Specifically, it utilizes a Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (TVAE) method for automated data balancing, tree-based ML models for automated feature selection and base model learning, Bayesian Optimization (BO) for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE) method for automated model ensemble. The proposed AutoML-based IDS was evaluated on two public benchmark network security datasets, CICIDS2017 and 5G-NIDD, and demonstrated improved performance compared to state-of-the-art cybersecurity methods. This research marks a significant step towards fully autonomous cybersecurity in next-generation networks, potentially revolutionizing network security applications.</description>

      <title>Causal Temporal Representation Learning with Nonstationary Sparse Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal Temporal Representation Learning (Ctrl) methods aim to identify the temporal causal dynamics of complex nonstationary temporal sequences. Despite the success of existing Ctrl methods, they require either directly observing the domain variables or assuming a Markov prior on them. Such requirements limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios when we do not have such prior knowledge of the domain variables. To address this problem, this work adopts a sparse transition assumption, aligned with intuitive human understanding, and presents identifiability results from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we explore under what conditions on the significance of the variability of the transitions we can build a model to identify the distribution shifts. Based on the theoretical result, we introduce a novel framework, Causal Temporal Representation Learning with Nonstationary Sparse Transition (CtrlNS), designed to leverage the constraints on transition sparsity and conditional independence to reliably identify both distribution shifts and latent factors. Our experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid global aging trend has led to an increase in dementia cases, including Alzheimer's disease, underscoring the urgent need for early and accurate diagnostic methods. Traditional diagnostic techniques, such as cognitive tests, neuroimaging, and biomarker analysis, face significant limitations in sensitivity, accessibility, and cost, particularly in the early stages. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) as a transformative approach to enhance early dementia detection by leveraging ML models to analyze and integrate complex multimodal datasets, including cognitive assessments, neuroimaging, and genetic information. A comprehensive review of existing literature was conducted to evaluate various ML models, including supervised learning, deep learning, and advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and transformer models, assessing their accuracy, interpretability, and potential for clinical integration. The findings indicate that while ML models show significant promise in improving diagnostic precision and enabling earlier interventions, challenges remain in their generalizability, interpretability, and ethical deployment. This research concludes by outlining future directions aimed at enhancing the clinical utility of ML models in dementia detection, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and ethically sound frameworks to improve early detection and intervention strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.</description>

      <title>Discovering Cyclists' Street Visual Preferences Through Multi-Source Big Data Using Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycling has gained global popularity for its health benefits and positive urban impacts. To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated street visual preferences from cycling records by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning (MEDIRL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing (DBS) trajectory and street view images (SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' street visual preferences. Further analysis reveals the nonlinear and interactive effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a holistic perspective on streetscape design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although fundamental to the advancement of Machine Learning, the classic evaluation metrics extracted from the confusion matrix, such as precision and F1, are limited. Such metrics only offer a quantitative view of the models' performance, without considering the complexity of the data or the quality of the hit. To overcome these limitations, recent research has introduced the use of psychometric metrics such as Item Response Theory (IRT), which allows an assessment at the level of latent characteristics of instances. This work investigates how IRT concepts can enrich a confusion matrix in order to identify which model is the most appropriate among options with similar performance. In the study carried out, IRT does not replace, but complements classical metrics by offering a new layer of evaluation and observation of the fine behavior of models in specific instances. It was also observed that there is 97% confidence that the score from the IRT has different contributions from 66% of the classical metrics analyzed.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Matrix Visualization for Understanding Tree Ensemble Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high performance of tree ensemble classifiers benefits from a large set of rules, which, in turn, makes the models hard to understand. To improve interpretability, existing methods extract a subset of rules for approximation using model reduction techniques. However, by focusing on the reduced rule set, these methods often lose fidelity and ignore anomalous rules that, despite their infrequency, play crucial roles in real-world applications. This paper introduces a scalable visual analysis method to explain tree ensemble classifiers that contain tens of thousands of rules. The key idea is to address the issue of losing fidelity by adaptively organizing the rules as a hierarchy rather than reducing them. To ensure the inclusion of anomalous rules, we develop an anomaly-biased model reduction method to prioritize these rules at each hierarchical level. Synergized with this hierarchical organization of rules, we develop a matrix-based hierarchical visualization to support exploration at different levels of detail. Our quantitative experiments and case studies demonstrate how our method fosters a deeper understanding of both common and anomalous rules, thereby enhancing interpretability without sacrificing comprehensiveness.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based algorithms for at-home respiratory disease monitoring and respiratory assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory diseases impose a significant burden on global health, with current diagnostic and management practices primarily reliant on specialist clinical testing. This work aims to develop machine learning-based algorithms to facilitate at-home respiratory disease monitoring and assessment for patients undergoing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Data were collected from 30 healthy adults, encompassing respiratory pressure, flow, and dynamic thoraco-abdominal circumferential measurements under three breathing conditions: normal, panting, and deep breathing. Various machine learning models, including the random forest classifier, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM), were trained to predict breathing types. The random forest classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy, particularly when incorporating breathing rate as a feature. These findings support the potential of AI-driven respiratory monitoring systems to transition respiratory assessments from clinical settings to home environments, enhancing accessibility and patient autonomy. Future work involves validating these models with larger, more diverse populations and exploring additional machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Pricing American Options using Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly in the context of pricing American options using Monte Carlo simulations. Traditional models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton framework, often fail to adequately address the complexities of American options, which include the ability for early exercise and non-linear payoff structures. By leveraging Monte Carlo methods in conjunction Least Square Method machine learning was used. This research aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of option pricing. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including neural networks and decision trees, highlighting their potential to outperform traditional approaches. The results from applying machine learning algorithm in LSM indicate that integrating machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations can enhance pricing accuracy and provide more robust predictions, offering significant insights into quantitative finance by merging classical financial theories with modern computational techniques. The dataset was split into features and the target variable representing bid prices, with an 80-20 train-validation split. LSTM and GRU models were constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API, each with four hidden layers of 200 neurons and an output layer for bid price prediction, optimized with the Adam optimizer and MSE loss function. The GRU model outperformed the LSTM model across all evaluated metrics, demonstrating lower mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error, along with greater stability and efficiency in training.</description>

      <title>FairQuant: Certifying and Quantifying Fairness of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for formally certifying and quantifying individual fairness of deep neural networks (DNN). Individual fairness guarantees that any two individuals who are identical except for a legally protected attribute (e.g., gender or race) receive the same treatment. While there are existing techniques that provide such a guarantee, they tend to suffer from lack of scalability or accuracy as the size and input dimension of the DNN increase. Our method overcomes this limitation by applying abstraction to a symbolic interval based analysis of the DNN followed by iterative refinement guided by the fairness property. Furthermore, our method lifts the symbolic interval based analysis from conventional qualitative certification to quantitative certification, by computing the percentage of individuals whose classification outputs are provably fair, instead of merely deciding if the DNN is fair. We have implemented our method and evaluated it on deep neural networks trained on four popular fairness research datasets. The experimental results show that our method is not only more accurate than state-of-the-art techniques but also several orders-of-magnitude faster.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

      <title>Robust Q-Learning under Corrupted Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in analyzing the non-asymptotic behavior of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the performance of such algorithms in non-ideal environments, such as in the presence of corrupted rewards, is poorly understood. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the robustness of the celebrated Q-learning algorithm to a strong-contamination attack model, where an adversary can arbitrarily perturb a small fraction of the observed rewards. We start by proving that such an attack can cause the vanilla Q-learning algorithm to incur arbitrarily large errors. We then develop a novel robust synchronous Q-learning algorithm that uses historical reward data to construct robust empirical Bellman operators at each time step. Finally, we prove a finite-time convergence rate for our algorithm that matches known state-of-the-art bounds (in the absence of attacks) up to a small inevitable $O(\varepsilon)$ error term that scales with the adversarial corruption fraction $\varepsilon$. Notably, our results continue to hold even when the true reward distributions have infinite support, provided they admit bounded second moments.</description>

      <title>DiffGrad for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are regarded as state-of-the-art tools for addressing highly nonlinear problems based on partial differential equations. Despite their broad range of applications, PINNs encounter several performance challenges, including issues related to efficiency, minimization of computational cost, and enhancement of accuracy. Burgers' equation, a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that is extensively used in PINNs, provides flexible results with the Adam optimizer that does not account for past gradients. This paper introduces a novel strategy for solving Burgers' equation by incorporating DiffGrad with PINNs, a method that leverages the difference between current and immediately preceding gradients to enhance performance. A comprehensive computational analysis is conducted using optimizers such as Adam, Adamax, RMSprop, and DiffGrad to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. Our approach includes visualizing the solutions over space at various time intervals to demonstrate the accuracy of the network. The results show that DiffGrad not only improves the accuracy of the solution but also reduces training time compared to the other optimizers.</description>

      <title>Tensor network square root Kalman filter for online Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art tensor network Kalman filter lifts the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional recursive estimation problems. However, the required rounding operation can cause filter divergence due to the loss of positive definiteness of covariance matrices. We solve this issue by developing, for the first time, a tensor network square root Kalman filter, and apply it to high-dimensional online Gaussian process regression. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method is equivalent to the conventional Kalman filter when choosing a full-rank tensor network. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-life system identification problem where we estimate $4^{14}$ parameters on a standard laptop. The estimated model outperforms the state-of-the-art tensor network Kalman filter in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are different from recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Existing traffic speed prediction studies are incident-agnostic and use one single model to learn all possible patterns from these drastically diverse conditions. This study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve traffic speed prediction under two separate conditions, recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., with and without incidents). The MoE leverages separate recurrent and non-recurrent expert models (Temporal Fusion Transformers) to capture the distinct patterns of each traffic condition. Additionally, we propose a training pipeline for non-recurrent models to remedy the limited data issues. To train our model, multi-source datasets, including traffic speed, incident reports, and weather data, are integrated and processed to be informative features. Evaluations on a real road network demonstrate that the MoE achieves lower errors compared to other benchmark algorithms. The model predictions are interpreted in terms of temporal dependencies and variable importance in each condition separately to shed light on the differences between recurrent and non-recurrent conditions.</description>

      <title>ELO-Rated Sequence Rewards: Advancing Reinforcement Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is highly dependent on the meticulous design of the reward function. However, accurately assigning rewards to each state-action pair in Long-Term RL (LTRL) challenges is formidable. Consequently, RL agents are predominantly trained with expert guidance. Drawing on the principles of ordinal utility theory from economics, we propose a novel reward estimation algorithm: ELO-Rating based RL (ERRL). This approach is distinguished by two main features. Firstly, it leverages expert preferences over trajectories instead of cardinal rewards (utilities) to compute the ELO rating of each trajectory as its reward. Secondly, a new reward redistribution algorithm is introduced to mitigate training volatility in the absence of a fixed anchor reward. Our method demonstrates superior performance over several leading baselines in long-term scenarios (extending up to 5000 steps), where conventional RL algorithms falter. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of how expert preferences affect the outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of training an unbiased and accurate model given a dataset with multiple biases. This problem is challenging since the multiple biases cause multiple undesirable shortcuts during training, and even worse, mitigating one may exacerbate the other. We propose a novel training method to tackle this challenge. Our method first groups training data so that different groups induce different shortcuts, and then optimizes a linear combination of group-wise losses while adjusting their weights dynamically to alleviate conflicts between the groups in performance; this approach, rooted in the multi-objective optimization theory, encourages to achieve the minimax Pareto solution. We also present a new benchmark with multiple biases, dubbed MultiCelebA, for evaluating debiased training methods under realistic and challenging scenarios. Our method achieved the best on three datasets with multiple biases, and also showed superior performance on conventional single-bias datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards training digitally-tied analog blocks via hybrid gradient computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power efficiency is plateauing in the standard digital electronics realm such that novel hardware, models, and algorithms are needed to reduce the costs of AI training. The combination of energy-based analog circuits and the Equilibrium Propagation (EP) algorithm constitutes one compelling alternative compute paradigm for gradient-based optimization of neural nets. Existing analog hardware accelerators, however, typically incorporate digital circuitry to sustain auxiliary non-weight-stationary operations, mitigate analog device imperfections, and leverage existing digital accelerators.This heterogeneous hardware approach calls for a new theoretical model building block. In this work, we introduce Feedforward-tied Energy-based Models (ff-EBMs), a hybrid model comprising feedforward and energy-based blocks accounting for digital and analog circuits. We derive a novel algorithm to compute gradients end-to-end in ff-EBMs by backpropagating and "eq-propagating" through feedforward and energy-based parts respectively, enabling EP to be applied to much more flexible and realistic architectures. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on ff-EBMs where Deep Hopfield Networks (DHNs) are used as energy-based blocks. We first show that a standard DHN can be arbitrarily split into any uniform size while maintaining performance. We then train ff-EBMs on ImageNet32 where we establish new SOTA performance in the EP literature (46 top-1 %). Our approach offers a principled, scalable, and incremental roadmap to gradually integrate self-trainable analog computational primitives into existing digital accelerators.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling data with graph structures. Recently, attention mechanisms have been integrated into GNNs to improve their ability to capture complex patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive study revealing a critical, unexplored consequence of this integration: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. We introduce a novel method for detecting and analyzing MAs, focusing on edge features in different graph transformer architectures. Our study assesses various GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs based on activation ratio distributions, (3) introducing the Explicit Bias Term (EBT) as a potential countermeasure and exploring it as an adversarial framework to assess models robustness based on the presence or absence of MAs. Our findings highlight the prevalence and impact of attention-induced MAs across different architectures, such as GraphTransformer, GraphiT, and SAN. The study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, model architecture, dataset characteristics, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for developing more robust and reliable graph models.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach for Solving Distributed Order Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for solving distributed-order fractional differential equations using a physics-informed machine learning framework. The core of this approach involves extending the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to approximate the unknown solutions of the governing equations during the training phase. By embedding the distributed-order functional equation into the SVR framework, we incorporate physical laws directly into the learning process. To further enhance computational efficiency, Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials are employed as the kernel function, capitalizing on their fractional differentiation properties to streamline the problem formulation. Finally, the resulting optimization problem of SVR is addressed either as a quadratic programming problem or as a positive definite system in its dual form. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a series of numerical experiments on Caputo-based distributed-order fractional differential equations, encompassing both ordinary and partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Risk-based Calibration for Probabilistic Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general iterative procedure called risk-based calibration (RC) designed to minimize the empirical risk under the 0-1 loss (empirical error) for probabilistic classifiers. These classifiers are based on modeling probability distributions, including those constructed from the joint distribution (generative) and those based on the class conditional distribution (conditional). RC can be particularized to any probabilistic classifier provided a specific learning algorithm that computes the classifier's parameters in closed form using data statistics. RC reinforces the statistics aligned with the true class while penalizing those associated with other classes, guided by the 0-1 loss. The proposed method has been empirically tested on 30 datasets using na\"ive Bayes, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression classifiers. RC improves the empirical error of the original closed-form learning algorithms and, more notably, consistently outperforms the gradient descent approach with the three classifiers.</description>

      <title>The Power of Second Chance: Personalized Submodular Maximization with Two Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of existing studies on submodular maximization focus on selecting a subset of items that maximizes a \emph{single} submodular function. However, in many real-world scenarios, we might have multiple user-specific functions, each of which models the utility of a particular type of user. In these settings, our goal would be to choose a set of items that performs well across all the user-specific functions. One way to tackle this problem is to select a single subset that maximizes the sum of all of the user-specific functions. Although this aggregate approach is efficient in the sense that it avoids computation of sets for individual functions, it really misses the power of personalization - for it does not allow to choose different sets for different functions. In this paper, we introduce the problem of personalized submodular maximization with two candidate solutions. For any two candidate solutions, the utility of each user-specific function is defined as the better of these two candidates. Our objective is, therefore, to select the best set of two candidates that maximize the sum of utilities of all the user-specific functions. We have designed effective algorithms for this problem. We also discuss how our approach generalizes to multiple candidate solutions, increasing flexibility and personalization in our solution.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Neural Network Compression via Decomposition and Optimal Rank Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, complex neural networks demand significant computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. Compression algorithms have been developed to address these challenges by reducing model size and computational demands while maintaining accuracy. Among these approaches, factorization methods based on tensor decomposition are theoretically sound and effective. However, they face difficulties in selecting the appropriate rank for decomposition. This paper tackles this issue by presenting a unified framework that simultaneously applies decomposition and optimal rank selection, employing a composite compression loss within defined rank constraints. Our approach includes an automatic rank search in a continuous space, efficiently identifying optimal rank configurations without the use of training data, making it computationally efficient. Combined with a subsequent fine-tuning step, our approach maintains the performance of highly compressed models on par with their original counterparts. Using various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a comprehensive analysis.</description>

      <title>CHIRPs: Change-Induced Regret Proxy metrics for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in static tasks but are costly to train and fragile to task changes. This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios where training experience is expensive or the context changes through factors like sensor degradation, environmental processes or changing mission priorities. Lifelong reinforcement learning aims to improve sample efficiency and adaptability by studying how agents perform in evolving problems. The difficulty that these changes pose to an agent is rarely measured directly, however. Agent performances can be compared across a change, but this is often prohibitively expensive. We propose Change-Induced Regret Proxy (CHIRP) metrics, a class of metrics for approximating a change's difficulty while avoiding the high costs of using trained agents. A relationship between a CHIRP metric and agent performance is identified in two environments, a simple grid world and MetaWorld's suite of robotic arm tasks. We demonstrate two uses for these metrics: for learning, an agent that clusters MDPs based on a CHIRP metric achieves $17\%$ higher average returns than three existing agents in a sequence of MetaWorld tasks. We also show how a CHIRP can be calibrated to compare the difficulty of changes across distinctly different environments.</description>

      <title>Costs Estimation in Unit Commitment Problems using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a key optimization task in power systems to forecast the generation schedules of power units over a finite time period by minimizing costs while meeting demand and technical constraints. However, many parameters required by the UC problem are unknown, such as the costs. In this work, we estimate these unknown costs using simulation-based inference on an illustrative UC problem, which provides an approximated posterior distribution of the parameters given observed generation schedules and demands. Our results highlight that the learned posterior distribution effectively captures the underlying distribution of the data, providing a range of possible values for the unknown parameters given a past observation. This posterior allows for the estimation of past costs using observed past generation schedules, enabling operators to better forecast future costs and make more robust generation scheduling forecasts. We present avenues for future research to address overconfidence in posterior estimation, enhance the scalability of the methodology and apply it to more complex UC problems modeling the network constraints and renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to evaluating the adversarial distance for machine learning classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness is critical for machine learning (ML) classifiers to ensure consistent performance in real-world applications where models may encounter corrupted or adversarial inputs. In particular, assessing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial inputs is essential to protect systems from vulnerabilities and thus ensure safety in use. However, methods to accurately compute adversarial robustness have been challenging for complex ML models and high-dimensional data. Furthermore, evaluations typically measure adversarial accuracy on specific attack budgets, limiting the informative value of the resulting metrics. This paper investigates the estimation of the more informative adversarial distance using iterative adversarial attacks and a certification approach. Combined, the methods provide a comprehensive evaluation of adversarial robustness by computing estimates for the upper and lower bounds of the adversarial distance. We present visualisations and ablation studies that provide insights into how this evaluation method should be applied and parameterised. We find that our adversarial attack approach is effective compared to related implementations, while the certification method falls short of expectations. The approach in this paper should encourage a more informative way of evaluating the adversarial robustness of ML classifiers.</description>

      <title>VFLGAN-TS: Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Networks for Publication of Vertically Partitioned Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model. However, often original data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns and regulations. A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, the attributes required to train an AI model are distributed among different parties, and the parties cannot share the local data for synthetic data construction due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2024, we recently introduced the first Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (VFLGAN) for publishing vertically partitioned static data. However, VFLGAN cannot effectively handle time-series data, presenting both temporal and attribute dimensions. In this article, we proposed VFLGAN-TS, which combines the ideas of attribute discriminator and vertical federated learning to generate synthetic time-series data in the vertically partitioned scenario. The performance of VFLGAN-TS is close to that of its counterpart, which is trained in a centralized manner and represents the upper limit for VFLGAN-TS. To further protect privacy, we apply a Gaussian mechanism to make VFLGAN-TS satisfy an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Besides, we develop an enhanced privacy auditing scheme to evaluate the potential privacy breach through the framework of VFLGAN-TS and synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Model Interpretability: Socio-Structural Explanations in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is it to interpret the outputs of an opaque machine learning model. One approach is to develop interpretable machine learning techniques. These techniques aim to show how machine learning models function by providing either model centric local or global explanations, which can be based on mechanistic interpretations revealing the inner working mechanisms of models or nonmechanistic approximations showing input feature output data relationships. In this paper, we draw on social philosophy to argue that interpreting machine learning outputs in certain normatively salient domains could require appealing to a third type of explanation that we call sociostructural explanation. The relevance of this explanation type is motivated by the fact that machine learning models are not isolated entities but are embedded within and shaped by social structures. Sociostructural explanations aim to illustrate how social structures contribute to and partially explain the outputs of machine learning models. We demonstrate the importance of sociostructural explanations by examining a racially biased healthcare allocation algorithm. Our proposal highlights the need for transparency beyond model interpretability, understanding the outputs of machine learning systems could require a broader analysis that extends beyond the understanding of the machine learning model itself.</description>

      <title>Limited but consistent gains in adversarial robustness by co-training object recognition models with human EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to human vision, artificial neural networks (ANNs) remain relatively susceptible to adversarial attacks. To address this vulnerability, efforts have been made to transfer inductive bias from human brains to ANNs, often by training the ANN representations to match their biological counterparts. Previous works relied on brain data acquired in rodents or primates using invasive techniques, from specific regions of the brain, under non-natural conditions (anesthetized animals), and with stimulus datasets lacking diversity and naturalness. In this work, we explored whether aligning model representations to human EEG responses to a rich set of real-world images increases robustness to ANNs. Specifically, we trained ResNet50-backbone models on a dual task of classification and EEG prediction; and evaluated their EEG prediction accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks. We observed significant correlation between the networks' EEG prediction accuracy, often highest around 100 ms post stimulus onset, and their gains in adversarial robustness. Although effect size was limited, effects were consistent across different random initializations and robust for architectural variants. We further teased apart the data from individual EEG channels and observed strongest contribution from electrodes in the parieto-occipital regions. The demonstrated utility of human EEG for such tasks opens up avenues for future efforts that scale to larger datasets under diverse stimuli conditions with the promise of stronger effects.</description>

      <title>On the Limited Generalization Capability of the Implicit Reward Model Induced by Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.</description>

      <title>A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</description>

      <title>A Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investors are continuously seeking profitable investment opportunities in startups and, hence, for effective decision-making, need to predict a startup's probability of success. Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power. Our work provides a decision support tool for investors to find profitable investment opportunities.</description>

      <title>Wind turbine condition monitoring based on intra- and inter-farm federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wind energy adoption is growing, ensuring the efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines becomes essential for maximizing energy production and minimizing costs and downtime. Many AI applications in wind energy, such as in condition monitoring and power forecasting, may benefit from using operational data not only from individual wind turbines but from multiple turbines and multiple wind farms. Collaborative distributed AI which preserves data privacy holds a strong potential for these applications. Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning approach in this context. We explore federated learning in wind turbine condition monitoring, specifically for fault detection using normal behaviour models. We investigate various federated learning strategies, including collaboration across different wind farms and turbine models, as well as collaboration restricted to the same wind farm and turbine model. Our case study results indicate that federated learning across multiple wind turbines consistently outperforms models trained on a single turbine, especially when training data is scarce. Moreover, the amount of historical data necessary to train an effective model can be significantly reduced by employing a collaborative federated learning strategy. Finally, our findings show that extending the collaboration to multiple wind farms may result in inferior performance compared to restricting learning within a farm, specifically when faced with statistical heterogeneity and imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>A New First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithm with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning new tasks by drawing on prior experience gathered from other (related) tasks is a core property of any intelligent system. Gradient-based meta-learning, especially MAML and its variants, has emerged as a viable solution to accomplish this goal. One problem MAML encounters is its computational and memory burdens needed to compute the meta-gradients. We propose a new first-order variant of MAML that we prove converges to a stationary point of the MAML objective, unlike other first-order variants. We also show that the MAML objective does not satisfy the smoothness assumption assumed in previous works; we show instead that its smoothness constant grows with the norm of the meta-gradient, which theoretically suggests the use of normalized or clipped-gradient methods compared to the plain gradient method used in previous works. We validate our theory on a synthetic experiment.</description>

      <title>Classification and Prediction of Heart Diseases using Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart disease is a serious worldwide health issue because it claims the lives of many people who might have been treated if the disease had been identified earlier. The leading cause of death in the world is cardiovascular disease, usually referred to as heart disease. Creating reliable, effective, and precise predictions for these diseases is one of the biggest issues facing the medical world today. Although there are tools for predicting heart diseases, they are either expensive or challenging to apply for determining a patient's risk. The best classifier for foretelling and spotting heart disease was the aim of this research. This experiment examined a range of machine learning approaches, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks, to determine which machine learning algorithm was most effective at predicting heart diseases. One of the most often utilized data sets for this purpose, the UCI heart disease repository provided the data set for this study. The K-Nearest Neighbor technique was shown to be the most effective machine learning algorithm for determining whether a patient has heart disease. It will be beneficial to conduct further studies on the application of additional machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction.</description>

      <title>Inverse decision-making using neural amortized Bayesian actors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian observer and actor models have provided normative explanations for many behavioral phenomena in perception, sensorimotor control, and other areas of cognitive science and neuroscience. They attribute behavioral variability and biases to different interpretable entities such as perceptual and motor uncertainty, prior beliefs, and behavioral costs. However, when extending these models to more complex tasks with continuous actions, solving the Bayesian decision-making problem is often analytically intractable. Moreover, inverting such models to perform inference over their parameters given behavioral data is computationally even more difficult. Therefore, researchers typically constrain their models to easily tractable components, such as Gaussian distributions or quadratic cost functions, or resort to numerical methods. To overcome these limitations, we amortize the Bayesian actor using a neural network trained on a wide range of different parameter settings in an unsupervised fashion. Using the pre-trained neural network enables performing gradient-based Bayesian inference of the Bayesian actor model's parameters. We show on synthetic data that the inferred posterior distributions are in close alignment with those obtained using analytical solutions where they exist. Where no analytical solution is available, we recover posterior distributions close to the ground truth. We then show that identifiability problems between priors and costs can arise in more complex cost functions. Finally, we apply our method to empirical data and show that it explains systematic individual differences of behavioral patterns.</description>

      <title>Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute has not yet yielded analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PLANSEARCH generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PLANSEARCH explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PLANSEARCH on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.</description>

      <title>Safety vs. Performance: How Multi-Objective Learning Reduces Barriers to Market Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging marketplaces for large language models and other large-scale machine learning (ML) models appear to exhibit market concentration, which has raised concerns about whether there are insurmountable barriers to entry in such markets. In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry -- the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company's dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>LLM-CI: Assessing Contextual Integrity Norms in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while memorizing parts of their training data scraped from the Internet, may also inadvertently encode societal preferences and norms. As these models are integrated into sociotechnical systems, it is crucial that the norms they encode align with societal expectations. These norms could vary across models, hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and datasets. This is especially challenging due to prompt sensitivity$-$small variations in prompts yield different responses, rendering existing assessment methodologies unreliable. There is a need for a comprehensive framework covering various models, optimization, and datasets, along with a reliable methodology to assess encoded norms.
  We present LLM-CI, the first open-sourced framework to assess privacy norms encoded in LLMs. LLM-CI uses a Contextual Integrity-based factorial vignette methodology to assess the encoded norms across different contexts and LLMs. We propose the multi-prompt assessment methodology to address prompt sensitivity by assessing the norms from only the prompts that yield consistent responses across multiple variants. Using LLM-CI and our proposed methodology, we comprehensively evaluate LLMs using IoT and COPPA vignettes datasets from prior work, examining the impact of model properties (e.g., hyperparameters, capacity) and optimization strategies (e.g., alignment, quantization).</description>

      <title>Differentiable Discrete Event Simulation for Queuing Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Queuing network control is essential for managing congestion in job-processing systems such as service systems, communication networks, and manufacturing processes. Despite growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, queueing network control poses distinct challenges, including high stochasticity, large state and action spaces, and lack of stability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for policy optimization based on differentiable discrete event simulation. Our main insight is that by implementing a well-designed smoothing technique for discrete event dynamics, we can compute pathwise policy gradients for large-scale queueing networks using auto-differentiation software (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch) and GPU parallelization. Through extensive empirical experiments, we observe that our policy gradient estimators are several orders of magnitude more accurate than typical REINFORCE-based estimators. In addition, We propose a new policy architecture, which drastically improves stability while maintaining the flexibility of neural-network policies. In a wide variety of scheduling and admission control tasks, we demonstrate that training control policies with pathwise gradients leads to a 50-1000x improvement in sample efficiency over state-of-the-art RL methods. Unlike prior tailored approaches to queueing, our methods can flexibly handle realistic scenarios, including systems operating in non-stationary environments and those with non-exponential interarrival/service times.</description>

      <title>Understanding Data Importance in Machine Learning Attacks: Does Valuable Data Pose Greater Harm?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized numerous domains, playing a crucial role in driving advancements and enabling data-centric processes. The significance of data in training models and shaping their performance cannot be overstated. Recent research has highlighted the heterogeneous impact of individual data samples, particularly the presence of valuable data that significantly contributes to the utility and effectiveness of machine learning models. However, a critical question remains unanswered: are these valuable data samples more vulnerable to machine learning attacks? In this work, we investigate the relationship between data importance and machine learning attacks by analyzing five distinct attack types. Our findings reveal notable insights. For example, we observe that high importance data samples exhibit increased vulnerability in certain attacks, such as membership inference and model stealing. By analyzing the linkage between membership inference vulnerability and data importance, we demonstrate that sample characteristics can be integrated into membership metrics by introducing sample-specific criteria, therefore enhancing the membership inference performance. These findings emphasize the urgent need for innovative defense mechanisms that strike a balance between maximizing utility and safeguarding valuable data against potential exploitation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning in the Non-Linear Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule. Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image classification tasks, without requiring retraining. Few-shot CLIP is competitive with existing specialized architectures that were trained on the downstream tasks. Recent research demonstrates that the performance of CLIP can be further improved using lightweight adaptation approaches. However, previous methods adapt different modalities of the CLIP model individually, ignoring the interactions and relationships between visual and textual representations. In this work, we propose Multi-Modal Adapter, an approach for Multi-Modal adaptation of CLIP. Specifically, we add a trainable Multi-Head Attention layer that combines text and image features to produce an additive adaptation of both. Multi-Modal Adapter demonstrates improved generalizability, based on its performance on unseen classes compared to existing adaptation methods. We perform additional ablations and investigations to validate and interpret the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fair Minimum Representation Clustering via Integer Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data into a set of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g., electoral districts, playlists, TV channels) whose benefit can only be attained by groups when they reach a minimum level of representation (e.g., 50\% to elect their desired candidate). In this paper, we study the k-means and k-medians clustering problems with the additional constraint that each group (e.g., demographic group) must have a minimum level of representation in at least a given number of clusters. We formulate the problem through a mixed-integer optimization framework and present an alternating minimization algorithm, called MiniReL, that directly incorporates the fairness constraints. While incorporating the fairness criteria leads to an NP-Hard assignment problem within the algorithm, we provide computational approaches that make the algorithm practical even for large datasets. Numerical results show that the approach is able to create fairer clusters with practically no increase in the clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Do We Trust What They Say or What They Do? A Multimodal User Embedding Provides Personalized Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of social media, the importance of analyzing social network user data has also been put on the agenda. User representation learning in social media is a critical area of research, based on which we can conduct personalized content delivery, or detect malicious actors. Being more complicated than many other types of data, social network user data has inherent multimodal nature. Various multimodal approaches have been proposed to harness both text (i.e. post content) and relation (i.e. inter-user interaction) information to learn user embeddings of higher quality. The advent of Graph Neural Network models enables more end-to-end integration of user text embeddings and user interaction graphs in social networks. However, most of those approaches do not adequately elucidate which aspects of the data - text or graph structure information - are more helpful for predicting each specific user under a particular task, putting some burden on personalized downstream analysis and untrustworthy information filtering. We propose a simple yet effective framework called Contribution-Aware Multimodal User Embedding (CAMUE) for social networks. We have demonstrated with empirical evidence, that our approach can provide personalized explainable predictions, automatically mitigating the impact of unreliable information. We also conducted case studies to show how reasonable our results are. We observe that for most users, graph structure information is more trustworthy than text information, but there are some reasonable cases where text helps more. Our work paves the way for more explainable, reliable, and effective social media user embedding which allows for better personalized content delivery.</description>

      <title>LibMOON: A Gradient-based MultiObjective OptimizatioN Library in PyTorch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in machine learning, with applications in multi-task learning, learning under fairness or robustness constraints, etc. Instead of reducing multiple objective functions into a scalar objective, MOPs aim to optimize for the so-called Pareto optimality or Pareto set learning, which involves optimizing more than one objective function simultaneously, over models with millions of parameters. Existing benchmark libraries for MOPs mainly focus on evolutionary algorithms, most of which are zeroth-order methods that do not effectively utilize higher-order information from objectives and cannot scale to large-scale models with millions of parameters. In light of the above gap, this paper introduces LibMOON, the first multiobjective optimization library that supports state-of-the-art gradient-based methods, provides a fair benchmark, and is open-sourced for the community.</description>

      <title>How DREAMS are made: Emulating Satellite Galaxy and Subhalo Populations with Diffusion Models and Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between galaxies and their host dark matter (DM) halos is critical to our understanding of cosmology, galaxy formation, and DM physics. To maximize the return of upcoming cosmological surveys, we need an accurate way to model this complex relationship. Many techniques have been developed to model this connection, from Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to empirical and semi-analytic models to hydrodynamic. Hydrodynamic simulations can incorporate more detailed astrophysical processes but are computationally expensive; HODs, on the other hand, are computationally cheap but have limited accuracy. In this work, we present NeHOD, a generative framework based on variational diffusion model and Transformer, for painting galaxies/subhalos on top of DM with an accuracy of hydrodynamic simulations but at a computational cost similar to HOD. By modeling galaxies/subhalos as point clouds, instead of binning or voxelization, we can resolve small spatial scales down to the resolution of the simulations. For each halo, NeHOD predicts the positions, velocities, masses, and concentrations of its central and satellite galaxies. We train NeHOD on the TNG-Warm DM suite of the DREAMS project, which consists of 1024 high-resolution zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of Milky Way-mass halos with varying warm DM mass and astrophysical parameters. We show that our model captures the complex relationships between subhalo properties as a function of the simulation parameters, including the mass functions, stellar-halo mass relations, concentration-mass relations, and spatial clustering. Our method can be used for a large variety of downstream applications, from galaxy clustering to strong lensing studies.</description>

      <title>PIETRA: Physics-Informed Evidential Learning for Traversing Out-of-Distribution Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful approach for developing traversability models for off-road navigation, but these models often struggle with inputs unseen during training. Existing methods utilize techniques like evidential deep learning to quantify model uncertainty, helping to identify and avoid out-of-distribution terrain. However, always avoiding out-of-distribution terrain can be overly conservative, e.g., when novel terrain can be effectively analyzed using a physics-based model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability (PIETRA), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates physics priors directly into the mathematical formulation of evidential neural networks and introduces physics knowledge implicitly through an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed training loss. Our evidential network seamlessly transitions between learned and physics-based predictions for out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, the physics-informed loss regularizes the learned model, ensuring better alignment with the physics model. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that PIETRA improves both learning accuracy and navigation performance in environments with significant distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>CLUE: Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Previous studies suggest that LLMs' generation process involves uncertainty. However, existing approaches to uncertainty estimation mainly focus on sequence-level uncertainty, overlooking individual pieces of information within sequences. These methods fall short in separately assessing the uncertainty of each component in a sequence. In response, we propose a novel framework for Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation (CLUE) for LLMs. We leverage LLMs to convert output sequences into concept-level representations, breaking down sequences into individual concepts and measuring the uncertainty of each concept separately. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that CLUE can provide more interpretable uncertainty estimation results compared with sentence-level uncertainty, and could be a useful tool for various tasks such as hallucination detection and story generation.</description>

      <title>MDNF: Multi-Diffusion-Nets for Neural Fields on Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for representing neural fields on triangle meshes that is multi-resolution across both spatial and frequency domains. Inspired by the Neural Fourier Filter Bank (NFFB), our architecture decomposes the spatial and frequency domains by associating finer spatial resolution levels with higher frequency bands, while coarser resolutions are mapped to lower frequencies. To achieve geometry-aware spatial decomposition we leverage multiple DiffusionNet components, each associated with a different spatial resolution level. Subsequently, we apply a Fourier feature mapping to encourage finer resolution levels to be associated with higher frequencies. The final signal is composed in a wavelet-inspired manner using a sine-activated MLP, aggregating higher-frequency signals on top of lower-frequency ones. Our architecture attains high accuracy in learning complex neural fields and is robust to discontinuities, exponential scale variations of the target field, and mesh modification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through its application to diverse neural fields, such as synthetic RGB functions, UV texture coordinates, and vertex normals, illustrating different challenges. To validate our method, we compare its performance against two alternatives, showcasing the advantages of our multi-resolution architecture.</description>

      <title>Can Your Generative Model Detect Out-of-Distribution Covariate Shift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting Out-of-Distribution~(OOD) sensory data and covariate distribution shift aims to identify new test examples with different high-level image statistics to the captured, normal and In-Distribution (ID) set. Existing OOD detection literature largely focuses on semantic shift with little-to-no consensus over covariate shift. Generative models capture the ID data in an unsupervised manner, enabling them to effectively identify samples that deviate significantly from this learned distribution, irrespective of the downstream task. In this work, we elucidate the ability of generative models to detect and quantify domain-specific covariate shift through extensive analyses that involves a variety of models. To this end, we conjecture that it is sufficient to detect most occurring sensory faults (anomalies and deviations in global signals statistics) by solely modeling high-frequency signal-dependent and independent details. We propose a novel method, CovariateFlow, for OOD detection, specifically tailored to covariate heteroscedastic high-frequency image-components using conditional Normalizing Flows (cNFs). Our results on CIFAR10 vs. CIFAR10-C and ImageNet200 vs. ImageNet200-C demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by accurately detecting OOD covariate shift. This work contributes to enhancing the fidelity of imaging systems and aiding machine learning models in OOD detection in the presence of covariate shift.</description>

      <title>RoboKoop: Efficient Control Conditioned Representations from Visual Input in Robotics using Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional observations is a core ability of autonomous agents that requires underlying robust task control policies and adapting the underlying visual representations to the task. Most existing policies need a lot of training samples and treat this problem from the lens of two-stage learning with a controller learned on top of pre-trained vision models. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory and learn visual representations from robotic agents conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of learning stabilizing control for the agent. We introduce a Contrastive Spectral Koopman Embedding network that allows us to learn efficient linearized visual representations from the agent's visual data in a high dimensional latent space and utilizes reinforcement learning to perform off-policy control on top of the extracted representations with a linear controller. Our method enhances stability and control in gradient dynamics over time, significantly outperforming existing approaches by improving efficiency and accuracy in learning task policies over extended horizons.</description>

      <title>Probing self-attention in self-supervised speech models for cross-linguistic differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech models have gained traction thanks to increase in accuracy from novel transformer architectures. While this impressive increase in performance across automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmarks is noteworthy, there is still much that is unknown about the use of attention mechanisms for speech-related tasks. For example, while it is assumed that these models are learning language-independent (i.e., universal) speech representations, there has not yet been an in-depth exploration of what it would mean for the models to be language-independent. In the current paper, we explore this question within the realm of self-attention mechanisms of one small self-supervised speech transformer model (TERA). We find that even with a small model, the attention heads learned are diverse ranging from almost entirely diagonal to almost entirely global regardless of the training language. We highlight some notable differences in attention patterns between Turkish and English and demonstrate that the models do learn important phonological information during pretraining. We also present a head ablation study which shows that models across languages primarily rely on diagonal heads to classify phonemes.</description>

      <title>Generative artificial intelligence for computational chemistry: a roadmap to predicting emergent phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced exciting possibilities for computational chemistry. Generative AI methods have made significant progress in sampling molecular structures across chemical species, developing force fields, and speeding up simulations. This Perspective offers a structured overview, beginning with the fundamental theoretical concepts in both Generative AI and computational chemistry. It then covers widely used Generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before, and that Generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry. We suggest that to overcome these challenges, future AI models need to integrate core chemical principles, especially from statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Subsidy design for better social outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overcoming the impact of selfish behavior of rational players in multiagent systems is a fundamental problem in game theory. Without any intervention from a central agent, strategic users take actions in order to maximize their personal utility, which can lead to extremely inefficient overall system performance, often indicated by a high Price of Anarchy. Recent work (Lin et al. 2021) investigated and formalized yet another undesirable behavior of rational agents, that of avoiding freely available information about the game for selfish reasons, leading to worse social outcomes. A central planner can significantly mitigate these issues by injecting a subsidy to reduce certain costs associated with the system and obtain net gains in the system performance. Crucially, the planner needs to determine how to allocate this subsidy effectively.
  We formally show that designing subsidies that perfectly optimize the social good, in terms of minimizing the Price of Anarchy or preventing the information avoidance behavior, is computationally hard under standard complexity theoretic assumptions. On the positive side, we show that we can learn provably good values of subsidy in repeated games coming from the same domain. This data-driven subsidy design approach avoids solving computationally hard problems for unseen games by learning over polynomially many games. We also show that optimal subsidy can be learned with no-regret given an online sequence of games, under mild assumptions on the cost matrix. Our study focuses on two distinct games: a Bayesian extension of the well-studied fair cost-sharing game, and a component maintenance game with engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online sellers and advertisers are recommended keyphrases for their listed products, which they bid on to enhance their sales. One popular paradigm that generates such recommendations is Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC), which involves tagging/mapping keyphrases to items. We outline the limitations of using traditional item-query based tagging or mapping techniques for keyphrase recommendations on E-Commerce platforms. We introduce GraphEx, an innovative graph-based approach that recommends keyphrases to sellers using extraction of token permutations from item titles. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying on traditional metrics such as precision/recall can be misleading in practical applications, thereby necessitating a combination of metrics to evaluate performance in real-world scenarios. These metrics are designed to assess the relevance of keyphrases to items and the potential for buyer outreach. GraphEx outperforms production models at eBay, achieving the objectives mentioned above. It supports near real-time inferencing in resource-constrained production environments and scales effectively for billions of items.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary and Sparsely-correlated Multi-output Gaussian Process with Spike-and-Slab Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) is commonly used as a transfer learning method to leverage information among multiple outputs. A key advantage of MGP is providing uncertainty quantification for prediction, which is highly important for subsequent decision-making tasks. However, traditional MGP may not be sufficiently flexible to handle multivariate data with dynamic characteristics, particularly when dealing with complex temporal correlations. Additionally, since some outputs may lack correlation, transferring information among them may lead to negative transfer. To address these issues, this study proposes a non-stationary MGP model that can capture both the dynamic and sparse correlation among outputs. Specifically, the covariance functions of MGP are constructed using convolutions of time-varying kernel functions. Then a dynamic spike-and-slab prior is placed on correlation parameters to automatically decide which sources are informative to the target output in the training process. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for efficient model fitting. Both numerical studies and a real case demonstrate its efficacy in capturing dynamic and sparse correlation structure and mitigating negative transfer for high-dimensional time-series data. Finally, a mountain-car reinforcement learning case highlights its potential application in decision making problems.</description>

      <title>InfraLib: Enabling Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making for Large Scale Infrastructure Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient management of infrastructure systems is crucial for economic stability, sustainability, and public safety. However, infrastructure management is challenging due to the vast scale of systems, stochastic deterioration of components, partial observability, and resource constraints. While data-driven approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) offer a promising avenue for optimizing management policies, their application to infrastructure has been limited by the lack of suitable simulation environments. We introduce InfraLib, a comprehensive framework for modeling and analyzing infrastructure management problems. InfraLib employs a hierarchical, stochastic approach to realistically model infrastructure systems and their deterioration. It supports practical functionality such as modeling component unavailability, cyclical budgets, and catastrophic failures. To facilitate research, InfraLib provides tools for expert data collection, simulation-driven analysis, and visualization. We demonstrate InfraLib's capabilities through case studies on a real-world road network and a synthetic benchmark with 100,000 components.</description>

      <title>How noise affects memory in linear recurrent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of noise on memory in a linear recurrent network are theoretically investigated. Memory is characterized by its ability to store previous inputs in its instantaneous state of network, which receives a correlated or uncorrelated noise. Two major properties are revealed: First, the memory reduced by noise is uniquely determined by the noise's power spectral density (PSD). Second, the memory will not decrease regardless of noise intensity if the PSD is in a certain class of distribution (including power law). The results are verified using the human brain signals, showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>Bi-capacity Choquet Integral for Sensor Fusion with Label Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensor sources to improve reliability, robustness, and accuracy of data interpretation. The Fuzzy Integral (FI), in particular, the Choquet integral (ChI), is often used as a powerful nonlinear aggregator for fusion across multiple sensors. However, existing supervised ChI learning algorithms typically require precise training labels for each input data point, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Additionally, prior work on ChI fusion is often based only on the normalized fuzzy measures, which bounds the fuzzy measure values between [0, 1]. This can be limiting in cases where the underlying scales of input data sources are bipolar (i.e., between [-1, 1]). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Choquet integral-based fusion framework, named Bi-MIChI (pronounced "bi-mi-kee"), which uses bi-capacities to represent the interactions between pairs of subsets of the input sensor sources on a bi-polar scale. This allows for extended non-linear interactions between the sensor sources and can lead to interesting fusion results. Bi-MIChI also addresses label uncertainty through Multiple Instance Learning, where training labels are applied to "bags" (sets) of data instead of per-instance. Our proposed Bi-MIChI framework shows effective classification and detection performance on both synthetic and real-world experiments for sensor fusion with label uncertainty. We also provide detailed analyses on the behavior of the fuzzy measures to demonstrate our fusion process.</description>

      <title>xLAM: A Family of Large Action Models to Empower AI Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant research interest. However, the open-source community faces many challenges in developing specialized models for agent tasks, driven by the scarcity of high-quality agent datasets and the absence of standard protocols in this area. We introduce and publicly release xLAM, a series of large action models designed for AI agent tasks. The xLAM series includes five models with both dense and mixture-of-expert architectures, ranging from 1B to 8x22B parameters, trained using a scalable, flexible pipeline that unifies, augments, and synthesizes diverse datasets to enhance AI agents' generalizability and performance across varied environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that xLAM consistently delivers exceptional performance across multiple agent ability benchmarks, notably securing the 1st position on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, outperforming GPT-4, Claude-3, and many other models in terms of tool use. By releasing the xLAM series, we aim to advance the performance of open-source LLMs for autonomous AI agents, potentially accelerating progress and democratizing access to high-performance models for agent tasks. Models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/Salesforce/xlam-models-65f00e2a0a63bbcd1c2dade4</description>

      <title>Application Research On Real-Time Perception Of Device Performance Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to accurately identify the performance status of mobile devices and finely adjust the user experience, a real-time performance perception evaluation method based on TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) combined with entropy weighting method and time series model construction was studied. After collecting the performance characteristics of various mobile devices, the device performance profile was fitted by using PCA (principal component analysis) dimensionality reduction and feature engineering methods such as descriptive time series analysis. The ability of performance features and profiles to describe the real-time performance status of devices was understood and studied by applying the TOPSIS method and multi-level weighting processing. A time series model was constructed for the feature set under objective weighting, and multiple sensitivity (real-time, short-term, long-term) performance status perception results were provided to obtain real-time performance evaluation data and long-term stable performance prediction data. Finally, by configuring dynamic AB experiments and overlaying fine-grained power reduction strategies, the usability of the method was verified, and the accuracy of device performance status identification and prediction was compared with the performance of the profile features including dimensionality reduction time series modeling, TOPSIS method and entropy weighting method, subjective weighting, HMA method. The results show that accurate real-time performance perception results can greatly enhance business value, and this research has application effectiveness and certain forward-looking significance.</description>

      <title>Content Moderation by LLM: From Accuracy to Legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One trending application of LLM (large language model) is to use it for content moderation in online platforms. Most current studies on this application have focused on the metric of accuracy - the extent to which LLM makes correct decisions about content. This article argues that accuracy is insufficient and misleading, because it fails to grasp the distinction between easy cases and hard cases as well as the inevitable trade-offs in achieving higher accuracy. Closer examination reveals that content moderation is a constitutive part of platform governance, the key of which is to gain and enhance legitimacy. Instead of making moderation decisions correct, the chief goal of LLM is to make them legitimate. In this regard, this article proposes a paradigm shift from the single benchmark of accuracy towards a legitimacy-based framework of evaluating the performance of LLM moderators. The framework suggests that for easy cases, the key is to ensure accuracy, speed and transparency, while for hard cases, what matters is reasoned justification and user participation. Examined under this framework, LLM's real potential in moderation is not accuracy improvement. Rather, LLM can better contribute in four other aspects: to conduct screening of hard cases from easy cases, to provide quality explanations for moderation decisions, to assist human reviewers in getting more contextual information, and to facilitate user participation in a more interactive way. Using normative theories from law and social sciences to critically assess the new technological application, this article seeks to redefine LLM's role in content moderation and redirect relevant research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) encounters the challenge of unbalanced labels, where certain entity types are overrepresented while others are underrepresented in real-world datasets. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on minority entity classes, impeding accurate and equitable entity recognition. This paper explores the effects of unbalanced entity labels of the BERT-based pre-trained model. We analyze the different mechanisms of loss calculation and loss propagation for the task of token classification on randomized datasets. Then we propose ways to improve the token classification for the highly imbalanced task of clinical entity recognition.</description>

      <title>Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</description>

      <title>SpinMultiNet: Neural Network Potential Incorporating Spin Degrees of Freedom with Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) have attracted significant attention as a method for accelerating density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, conventional NNP models typically do not incorporate spin degrees of freedom, limiting their applicability to systems where spin states critically influence material properties, such as transition metal oxides. This study introduces SpinMultiNet, a novel NNP model that integrates spin degrees of freedom through multi-task learning. SpinMultiNet achieves accurate predictions without relying on correct spin values obtained from DFT calculations. Instead, it utilizes initial spin estimates as input and leverages multi-task learning to optimize the spin latent representation while maintaining both $E(3)$ and time-reversal equivariance. Validation on a dataset of transition metal oxides demonstrates the high predictive accuracy of SpinMultiNet. The model successfully reproduces the energy ordering of stable spin configurations originating from superexchange interactions and accurately captures the rhombohedral distortion of the rocksalt structure. These results pave the way for new possibilities in materials simulations that consider spin degrees of freedom, promising future applications in large-scale simulations of various material systems, including magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>In Search of Trees: Decision-Tree Policy Synthesis for Black-Box Systems via Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision trees, owing to their interpretability, are attractive as control policies for (dynamical) systems. Unfortunately, constructing, or synthesising, such policies is a challenging task. Previous approaches do so by imitating a neural-network policy, approximating a tabular policy obtained via formal synthesis, employing reinforcement learning, or modelling the problem as a mixed-integer linear program. However, these works may require access to a hard-to-obtain accurate policy or a formal model of the environment (within reach of formal synthesis), and may not provide guarantees on the quality or size of the final tree policy. In contrast, we present an approach to synthesise optimal decision-tree policies given a black-box environment and specification, and a discretisation of the tree predicates, where optimality is defined with respect to the number of steps to achieve the goal. Our approach is a specialised search algorithm which systematically explores the (exponentially large) space of decision trees under the given discretisation. The key component is a novel pruning mechanism that significantly reduces the search space. Our approach represents a conceptually novel way of synthesising small decision-tree policies with optimality guarantees even for black-box environments with black-box specifications.</description>

      <title>LLM Detectors Still Fall Short of Real World: Case of LLM-Generated Short News-Like Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern. Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven. In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.
  We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting. All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks. A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.
  We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</description>

      <title>Bringing the RT-1-X Foundation Model to a SCARA robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional robotic systems require specific training data for each task, environment, and robot form. While recent advancements in machine learning have enabled models to generalize across new tasks and environments, the challenge of adapting these models to entirely new settings remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this by investigating the generalization capabilities of the RT-1-X robotic foundation model to a type of robot unseen during its training: a SCARA robot from UMI-RTX.
  Initial experiments reveal that RT-1-X does not generalize zero-shot to the unseen type of robot. However, fine-tuning of the RT-1-X model by demonstration allows the robot to learn a pickup task which was part of the foundation model (but learned for another type of robot). When the robot is presented with an object that is included in the foundation model but not in the fine-tuning dataset, it demonstrates that only the skill, but not the object-specific knowledge, has been transferred.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Learning Dynamics in Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) excel on tasks using functional data, such as those originating from partial differential equations. Such characteristics render them an effective approach for simulating the time evolution of quantum wavefunctions, which is a computationally challenging, yet coveted task for understanding quantum systems. In this manuscript, we use FNOs to model the evolution of random quantum spin systems, so chosen due to their representative quantum dynamics and minimal symmetry. We explore two distinct FNO architectures and examine their performance for learning and predicting time evolution using both random and low-energy input states. Additionally, we apply FNOs to a compact set of Hamiltonian observables ($\sim\text{poly}(n)$) instead of the entire $2^n$ quantum wavefunction, which greatly reduces the size of our inputs and outputs and, consequently, the requisite dimensions of the resulting FNOs. Moreover, this Hamiltonian observable-based method demonstrates that FNOs can effectively distill information from high-dimensional spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. The extrapolation of Hamiltonian observables to times later than those used in training is of particular interest, as this stands to fundamentally increase the simulatability of quantum systems past both the coherence times of contemporary quantum architectures and the circuit-depths of tractable tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Sparse Gaussian Classification: Provable Benefits of Unlabeled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The premise of semi-supervised learning (SSL) is that combining labeled and unlabeled data yields significantly more accurate models. Despite empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of SSL is still far from complete. In this work, we study SSL for high dimensional sparse Gaussian classification. To construct an accurate classifier a key task is feature selection, detecting the few variables that separate the two classes. % For this SSL setting, we analyze information theoretic lower bounds for accurate feature selection as well as computational lower bounds, assuming the low-degree likelihood hardness conjecture. % Our key contribution is the identification of a regime in the problem parameters (dimension, sparsity, number of labeled and unlabeled samples) where SSL is guaranteed to be advantageous for classification. Specifically, there is a regime where it is possible to construct in polynomial time an accurate SSL classifier. However, % any computationally efficient supervised or unsupervised learning schemes, that separately use only the labeled or unlabeled data would fail. Our work highlights the provable benefits of combining labeled and unlabeled data for {classification and} feature selection in high dimensions. We present simulations that complement our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabled by large annotated datasets, tracking and segmentation of objects in videos has made remarkable progress in recent years. Despite these advancements, algorithms still struggle under degraded conditions and during fast movements. Event cameras are novel sensors with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range that offer promising advantages to address these challenges. However, annotated data for developing learning-based mask-level tracking algorithms with events is not available. To this end, we introduce: ($i$) a new task termed \emph{space-time instance segmentation}, similar to video instance segmentation, whose goal is to segment instances throughout the entire duration of the sensor input (here, the input are quasi-continuous events and optionally aligned frames); and ($ii$) \emph{\dname}, a dataset for the new task, containing aligned grayscale frames and events. It includes annotated ground-truth labels (pixel-level instance segmentation masks) of a group of up to seven freely moving and interacting mice. We also provide two reference methods, which show that leveraging event data can consistently improve tracking performance, especially when used in combination with conventional cameras. The results highlight the potential of event-aided tracking in difficult scenarios. We hope our dataset opens the field of event-based video instance segmentation and enables the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging conditions.\url{https://github.com/tub-rip/MouseSIS}</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Task Large Model Training via Data Heterogeneity-aware Model Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent foundation models are capable of handling multiple machine learning (ML) tasks and multiple data modalities with the unified base model structure and several specialized model components. However, the development of such multi-task (MT) multi-modal (MM) models poses significant model management challenges to existing training systems. Due to the sophisticated model architecture and the heterogeneous workloads of different ML tasks and data modalities, training these models usually requires massive GPU resources and suffers from sub-optimal system efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate how to achieve high-performance training of large-scale MT MM models through data heterogeneity-aware model management optimization. The key idea is to decompose the model execution into stages and address the joint optimization problem sequentially, including both heterogeneity-aware workload parallelization and dependency-driven execution scheduling. Based on this, we build a prototype system and evaluate it on various large MT MM models. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our system, with speedup ratio up to 71% compared to state-of-the-art training systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models through Natural Language Processing to provide interpretable Machine Learning predictions of mental deterioration in real time</title>

Abstract: Based on official estimates, 50 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and this number increases by 10 million new patients every year. Without a cure, clinical prognostication and early intervention represent the most effective ways to delay its progression. To this end, Artificial Intelligence and computational linguistics can be exploited for natural language analysis, personalized assessment, monitoring, and treatment. However, traditional approaches need more semantic knowledge management and explicability capabilities. Moreover, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive decline diagnosis is still scarce, even though these models represent the most advanced way for clinical-patient communication using intelligent systems. Consequently, we leverage an LLM using the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a chatbot solution to provide interpretable Machine Learning prediction of cognitive decline in real-time. Linguistic-conceptual features are exploited for appropriate natural language analysis. Through explainability, we aim to fight potential biases of the models and improve their potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions. More in detail, the proposed pipeline is composed of (i) data extraction employing NLP-based prompt engineering; (ii) stream-based data processing including feature engineering, analysis, and selection; (iii) real-time classification; and (iv) the explainability dashboard to provide visual and natural language descriptions of the prediction outcome. Classification results exceed 80 % in all evaluation metrics, with a recall value for the mental deterioration class about 85 %. To sum up, we contribute with an affordable, flexible, non-invasive, personalized diagnostic system to this work.</description>

      <title>Raw Speech Enhancement with Deep State Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present aTENNuate, a simple deep state-space autoencoder configured for efficient online raw speech enhancement in an end-to-end fashion. The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.</description>

      <title>Panopticon: a novel deep learning model to detect single transit events with no prior data filtering in PLATO light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prepare for the analyses of the future PLATO light curves, we develop a deep learning model, Panopticon, to detect transits in high precision photometric light curves. Since PLATO's main objective is the detection of temperate Earth-size planets around solar-type stars, the code is designed to detect individual transit events. The filtering step, required by conventional detection methods, can affect the transit, which could be an issue for long and shallow transits. To protect transit shape and depth, the code is also designed to work on unfiltered light curves. We trained the model on a set of simulated PLATO light curves in which we injected, at pixel level, either planetary, eclipsing binary, or background eclipsing binary signals. We also include a variety of noises in our data, such as granulation, stellar spots or cosmic rays. The approach is able to recover 90% of our test population, including more than 25% of the Earth-analogs, even in the unfiltered light curves. The model also recovers the transits irrespective of the orbital period, and is able to retrieve transits on a unique event basis. These figures are obtained when accepting a false alarm rate of 1%. When keeping the false alarm rate low (&lt;0.01%), it is still able to recover more than 85% of the transit signals. Any transit deeper than 180ppm is essentially guaranteed to be recovered. This method is able to recover transits on a unique event basis, and does so with a low false alarm rate. Thanks to light curves being one-dimensional, model training is fast, on the order of a few hours per model. This speed in training and inference, coupled to the recovery effectiveness and precision of the model make it an ideal tool to complement, or be used ahead of, classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Improving Uncertainty-Error Correspondence in Deep Bayesian Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increased usage of automated tools like deep learning in medical image segmentation has alleviated the bottleneck of manual contouring. This has shifted manual labour to quality assessment (QA) of automated contours which involves detecting errors and correcting them. A potential solution to semi-automated QA is to use deep Bayesian uncertainty to recommend potentially erroneous regions, thus reducing time spent on error detection. Previous work has investigated the correspondence between uncertainty and error, however, no work has been done on improving the "utility" of Bayesian uncertainty maps such that it is only present in inaccurate regions and not in the accurate ones. Our work trains the FlipOut model with the Accuracy-vs-Uncertainty (AvU) loss which promotes uncertainty to be present only in inaccurate regions. We apply this method on datasets of two radiotherapy body sites, c.f. head-and-neck CT and prostate MR scans. Uncertainty heatmaps (i.e. predictive entropy) are evaluated against voxel inaccuracies using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves. Numerical results show that when compared to the Bayesian baseline the proposed method successfully suppresses uncertainty for accurate voxels, with similar presence of uncertainty for inaccurate voxels.

      <description>arXiv:2409.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous flow of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has revolutionised our ability to understand and interact with the world across various applications. However, this data must be prepared and transformed into event data before analysis can begin. In this paper, we shed light on the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in event abstraction and integration. Our approach aims to create event records from raw sensor readings and merge the logs from multiple IoT sources into a single event log suitable for further Process Mining applications. We demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in event abstraction considering a case study for IoT application in elderly care and longitudinal health monitoring. The results, showing on average an accuracy of 90% in detecting high-level activities. These results highlight LLMs' promising potential in addressing event abstraction and integration challenges, effectively bridging the existing gap.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty is challenging since the data-generating process (DGP) is often unknown. Bayesian inference proceeds by estimating the DGP through posterior beliefs about the model's parameters. However, minimising the expected risk under these posterior beliefs can lead to sub-optimal decisions due to model uncertainty or limited, noisy observations. To address this, we introduce Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-BAS) which hedges against uncertainty in the model by optimising the worst-case risk over a posterior-informed ambiguity set. We show that our method admits a closed-form dual representation for many exponential family members and showcase its improved out-of-sample robustness against existing Bayesian DRO methodology in the Newsvendor problem.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood inference for high-dimensional problems with multiaffine variable relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of continuous variable models can be very challenging in high dimensions, due to potentially complex probability distributions. The existence of multiple interdependencies among variables can make it very difficult to establish convergence guarantees. This leads to a wide use of brute-force methods, such as grid searching and Monte-Carlo sampling and, when applicable, complex and problem-specific algorithms. In this paper, we consider inference problems where the variables are related by multiaffine expressions. We propose a novel Alternating and Iteratively-Reweighted Least Squares (AIRLS) algorithm, and prove its convergence for problems with Generalized Normal Distributions. We also provide an efficient method to compute the variance of the estimates obtained using AIRLS. Finally, we show how the method can be applied to graphical statistical models. We perform numerical experiments on several inference problems, showing significantly better performance than state-of-the-art approaches in terms of scalability, robustness to noise, and convergence speed due to an empirically observed super-linear convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Survey of Data-driven Newsvendor: Unified Analysis and Spectrum of Achievable Regrets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Newsvendor problem, the goal is to guess the number that will be drawn from some distribution, with asymmetric consequences for guessing too high vs. too low. In the data-driven version, the distribution is unknown, and one must work with samples from the distribution. Data-driven Newsvendor has been studied under many variants: additive vs. multiplicative regret, high probability vs. expectation bounds, and different distribution classes. This paper studies all combinations of these variants, filling in many gaps in the literature and simplifying many proofs. In particular, we provide a unified analysis based on the notion of clustered distributions, which in conjunction with our new lower bounds, shows that the entire spectrum of regrets between $1/\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ can be possible.</description>

      <title>Prediction Accuracy &amp; Reliability: Classification and Object Localization under Distribution Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural distribution shift causes a deterioration in the perception performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This comprehensive analysis for real-world traffic data addresses: 1) investigating the effect of natural distribution shift and weather augmentations on both detection quality and confidence estimation, 2) evaluating model performance for both classification and object localization, and 3) benchmarking two common uncertainty quantification methods - Ensembles and different variants of Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout - under natural and close-to-natural distribution shift. For this purpose, a novel dataset has been curated from publicly available autonomous driving datasets. The in-distribution (ID) data is based on cutouts of a single object, for which both class and bounding box annotations are available. The six distribution-shift datasets cover adverse weather scenarios, simulated rain and fog, corner cases, and out-of-distribution data. A granular analysis of CNNs under distribution shift allows to quantize the impact of different types of shifts on both, task performance and confidence estimation: ConvNeXt-Tiny is more robust than EfficientNet-B0; heavy rain degrades classification stronger than localization, contrary to heavy fog; integrating MC-Dropout into selected layers only has the potential to enhance task performance and confidence estimation, whereby the identification of these layers depends on the type of distribution shift and the considered task.</description>

      <title>DKDM: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models with Any Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities across various areas, while they are hindered by slow inference speeds and high computational demands during deployment. The most common way to accelerate DMs involves reducing the number of denoising steps during generation, achieved through faster sampling solvers or knowledge distillation (KD). In contrast to prior approaches, we propose a novel method that transfers the capability of large pretrained DMs to faster architectures. Specifically, we employ KD in a distinct manner to compress DMs by distilling their generative ability into more rapid variants. Furthermore, considering that the source data is either unaccessible or too enormous to store for current generative models, we introduce a new paradigm for their distillation without source data, termed Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM). Generally, our established DKDM framework comprises two main components: 1) a DKDM objective that uses synthetic denoising data produced by pretrained DMs to optimize faster DMs without source data, and 2) a dynamic iterative distillation method that flexibly organizes the synthesis of denoising data, preventing it from slowing down the optimization process as the generation is slow. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using KD to distill DMs into any architecture in a data-free manner. Importantly, our DKDM is orthogonal to most existing acceleration methods, such as denoising step reduction, quantization and pruning. Experiments show that our DKDM is capable of deriving 2x faster DMs with performance remaining on par with the baseline. Notably, our DKDM enables pretrained DMs to function as "datasets" for training new DMs.</description>

      <title>MaskVal: Simple but Effective Uncertainty Quantification for 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the use of 6D pose estimation in robotic applications, reliable poses are of utmost importance to ensure a safe, reliable and predictable operational performance. Despite these requirements, state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators often do not provide any uncertainty quantification for their pose estimates at all, or if they do, it has been shown that the uncertainty provided is only weakly correlated with the actual true error. To address this issue, we investigate a simple but effective uncertainty quantification, that we call MaskVal, which compares the pose estimates with their corresponding instance segmentations by rendering and does not require any modification of the pose estimator itself. Despite its simplicity, MaskVal significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art ensemble method on both a dataset and a robotic setup. We show that by using MaskVal, the performance of a state-of-the-art 6D pose estimator is significantly improved towards a safe and reliable operation. In addition, we propose a new and specific approach to compare and evaluate uncertainty quantification methods for 6D pose estimation in the context of robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>100 instances is all you need: predicting the success of a new LLM on unseen data by testing on a few instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications. To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances. However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it. In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</description>

      <title>1 Modular Parallel Manipulator for Long-Term Soft Robotic Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing long-term experimentation or large-scale data collection for machine learning in the field of soft robotics is challenging, due to the hardware robustness and experimental flexibility required. In this work, we propose a modular parallel robotic manipulation platform suitable for such large-scale data collection and compatible with various soft-robotic fabrication methods. Considering the computational and theoretical difficulty of replicating the high-fidelity, faster-than-real-time simulations that enable large-scale data collection in rigid robotic systems, a robust soft-robotic hardware platform becomes a high priority development task for the field.
  The platform's modules consist of a pair of off-the-shelf electrical motors which actuate a customizable finger consisting of a compliant parallel structure. The parallel mechanism of the finger can be as simple as a single 3D-printed urethane or molded silicone bulk structure, due to the motors being able to fully actuate a passive structure. This design flexibility allows experimentation with soft mechanism varied geometries, bulk properties and surface properties. Additionally, while the parallel mechanism does not require separate electronics or additional parts, these can be included, and it can be constructed using multi-functional soft materials to study compatible soft sensors and actuators in the learning process. In this work, we validate the platform's ability to be used for policy gradient reinforcement learning directly on hardware in a benchmark 2D manipulation task. We additionally demonstrate compatibility with multiple fingers and characterize the design constraints for compatible extensions.</description>

Abstract: In many applications of multiple testing, ancillary information is available, reflecting the hypothesis null or alternative status. Several methods have been developed to leverage this ancillary information to enhance testing power, typically requiring the ancillary information is helpful enough to ensure favorable performance. In this paper, we develop a robust and effective distance-assisted multiple testing procedure named DART2, designed to be powerful and robust regardless of the quality of ancillary information. When the ancillary information is helpful, DART2 can asymptotically control FDR while improving power; otherwise, DART2 can still control FDR and maintain power at least as high as ignoring the ancillary information. We demonstrated DART2's superior performance compared to existing methods through numerical studies under various settings. In addition, DART2 has been applied to a gene association study where we have shown its superior accuracy and robustness under two different types of ancillary information.</description>

      <title>Privacy versus Emotion Preservation Trade-offs in Emotion-Preserving Speaker Anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in speech technology now allow unprecedented access to personally identifiable information through speech. To protect such information, the differential privacy field has explored ways to anonymize speech while preserving its utility, including linguistic and paralinguistic aspects. However, anonymizing speech while maintaining emotional state remains challenging. We explore this problem in the context of the VoicePrivacy 2024 challenge. Specifically, we developed various speaker anonymization pipelines and find that approaches either excel at anonymization or preserving emotion state, but not both simultaneously. Achieving both would require an in-domain emotion recognizer. Additionally, we found that it is feasible to train a semi-effective speaker verification system using only emotion representations, demonstrating the challenge of separating these two modalities.</description>

      <title>The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. Our approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing us to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.</description>

Abstract: Process curves are multi-variate finite time series data coming from manufacturing processes. This paper studies machine learning methods for drifts of process curves. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. A evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework shown.</description>

      <title>Practical Forecasting of Cryptocoins Timeseries using Correlation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocoins (i.e., Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) are tradable digital assets. Ownerships of cryptocoins are registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins among owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for specific trading prices. The extreme volatility of such trading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets remains undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across different cryptocoins remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation to advise for sells or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some light on the trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their coin/price correlation trends over the past two years. We study the causality between the trends, and exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for time series modeling (e.g., GBMs, LSTM and GRU) of correlated cryptocoins. Our evaluation shows (i) strong correlation patterns between the most traded coins (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether) and other types of cryptocurrencies, and (ii) state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms can be used to forecast cryptocoins price trends. We released datasets and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum channels over general product distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. Given query access to an $n$-qubit channel $E$ and an observable $O$, we aim to learn the mapping \begin{equation*}
  \rho \mapsto \mathrm{Tr}(O E[\rho]) \end{equation*} to within a small error for most $\rho$ sampled from a distribution $D$. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if $E$ is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly $n^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions $D$ invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states $\rho$.
  In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution $D$, provided it is not "classical" in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a "biased Pauli analysis," analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.</description>

      <title>View-Invariant Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data, these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

      <title>Iterative thresholding for non-linear learning in the strong $\varepsilon$-contamination model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive approximation bounds for learning single neuron models using thresholded gradient descent when both the labels and the covariates are possibly corrupted adversarially. We assume the data follows the model $y = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + \xi,$ where $\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation function, the noise $\xi$ is Gaussian, and the covariate vector $\mathbf{x}$ is sampled from a sub-Gaussian distribution. We study sigmoidal, leaky-ReLU, and ReLU activation functions and derive a $O(\nu\sqrt{\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon)})$ approximation bound in $\ell_{2}$-norm, with sample complexity $O(d/\epsilon)$ and failure probability $e^{-\Omega(d)}$.
  We also study the linear regression problem, where $\sigma(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}$. We derive a $O(\nu\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$ approximation bound, improving upon the previous $O(\nu)$ approximation bounds for the gradient-descent based iterative thresholding algorithms of Bhatia et al. (NeurIPS 2015) and Shen and Sanghavi (ICML 2019). Our algorithm has a $O(\textrm{polylog}(N,d)\log(R/\epsilon))$ runtime complexity when $\|\mathbf{w}^{*}\|_2 \leq R$, improving upon the $O(\text{polylog}(N,d)/\epsilon^2)$ runtime complexity of Awasthi et al. (NeurIPS 2022).</description>

      <title>Clustering of Indonesian and Western Gamelan Orchestras through Machine Learning of Performance Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indonesian and Western gamelan ensembles are investigated with respect to performance differences. Thereby, the often exotistic history of this music in the West might be reflected in contemporary tonal system, articulation, or large-scale form differences. Analyzing recordings of four Western and five Indonesian orchestras with respect to tonal systems and timbre features and using self-organizing Kohonen map (SOM) as a machine learning algorithm, a clear clustering between Indonesian and Western ensembles appears using certain psychoacoustic features. These point to a reduced articulation and large-scale form variability of Western ensembles compared to Indonesian ones. The SOM also clusters the ensembles with respect to their tonal systems, but no clusters between Indonesian and Western ensembles can be found in this respect. Therefore, a clear analogy between lower articulatory variability and large-scale form variation and a more exostistic, mediative and calm performance expectation and reception of gamelan in the West therefore appears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Sample-Efficient Speech Diffusion (SESD), an algorithm for effective speech synthesis in modest data regimes through latent diffusion. It is based on a novel diffusion architecture, that we call U-Audio Transformer (U-AT), that efficiently scales to long sequences and operates in the latent space of a pre-trained audio autoencoder. Conditioned on character-aware language model representations, SESD achieves impressive results despite training on less than 1k hours of speech - far less than current state-of-the-art systems. In fact, it synthesizes more intelligible speech than the state-of-the-art auto-regressive model, VALL-E, while using less than 2% the training data.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Learning Approach for Two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-stage adaptive robust optimization is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty that aims to balance costs of "here-and-now" first-stage decisions with those of "wait-and-see" recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To embed robustness against uncertainty, modelers typically assume a simple polyhedral or ellipsoidal set over which contingencies may be realized. However, these simple uncertainty sets tend to yield highly conservative decision-making when uncertainties are high-dimensional. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a column-and-constraint generation algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO identifies realistic and cost-maximizing contingencies by optimizing over spherical uncertainty sets in a latent space using a projected gradient ascent approach that differentiates the optimal recourse cost with respect to the latent variable. To demonstrate the cost- and time-efficiency of our approach experimentally, we apply AGRO to an adaptive robust capacity expansion problem for a regional power system and show that AGRO is able to reduce costs by up to 7.8% and runtimes by up to 77% in comparison to the conventional column-and-constraint generation algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis's utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.</description>

      <title>Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Painful intelligence: What AI can tell us about human suffering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book uses the modern theory of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human suffering or mental pain. Both humans and sophisticated AI agents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain rewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind. This book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general audience, requiring only some relevant scientific background.
  The book starts with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability, and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration.
  Fundamental in such modelling is the idea of learning, or adaptation to the environment. While AI uses machine learning, humans and animals adapt by a combination of evolutionary mechanisms and ordinary learning. Even frustration is fundamentally an error signal that the system uses for learning. This book explores various aspects and limitations of learning algorithms and their implications regarding suffering.
  At the end of the book, the computational theory is used to derive various interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans. The amount of frustration is expressed by a simple equation which indicates how it can be reduced. The ensuing interventions are very similar to those proposed by Buddhist and Stoic philosophy, and include mindfulness meditation. Therefore, this book can be interpreted as an exposition of a computational theory justifying why such philosophies and meditation reduce human suffering.</description>

      <title>TSFool: Crafting Highly-Imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through Multi-Objective Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06388</link>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of recurrent neural network (RNN) models in time series classification (TSC). However, neural networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which cause real-life adversarial attacks that undermine the robustness of AI models. To date, most existing attacks target at feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, but they cannot perform well on RNN-based TSC. This is due to the cyclical computation of RNN, which prevents direct model differentiation. In addition, the high visual sensitivity of time series to perturbations also poses challenges to local objective optimization of adversarial samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient method called TSFool to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN-based TSC. The core idea is a new global optimization objective known as "Camouflage Coefficient" that captures the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the class distribution. Based on this, we reduce the adversarial attack problem to a multi-objective optimization problem that enhances the perturbation quality. Furthermore, to speed up the optimization process, we propose to use a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples whose features deviate from the latent manifold. Experiments on 11 UCR and UEA datasets showcase that TSFool significantly outperforms six white-box and three black-box benchmark attacks in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and imperceptibility from various perspectives including standard measure, human study and real-world defense.</description>

      <title>CyclicFL: A Cyclic Model Pre-Training Approach to Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to enable distributed learning on Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) devices with guarantees of high-level data privacy. Since random initial models in FL can easily result in unregulated Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) processes, existing FL methods greatly suffer from both slow convergence and poor accuracy, especially in non-IID scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named CyclicFL, which can quickly derive effective initial models to guide the SGD processes, thus improving the overall FL training performance. We formally analyze the significance of data consistency between the pre-training and training stages of CyclicFL, showing the limited Lipschitzness of loss for the pre-trained models by CyclicFL. Moreover, we systematically prove that our method can achieve faster convergence speed under various convexity assumptions. Unlike traditional centralized pre-training methods that require public proxy data, CyclicFL pre-trains initial models on selected AIoT devices cyclically without exposing their local data. Therefore, they can be easily integrated into any security-critical FL methods. Comprehensive experimental results show that CyclicFL can not only improve the maximum classification accuracy by up to $14.11\%$ but also significantly accelerate the overall FL training process.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning with Mid-level Input Generation for Autonomous Driving on Urban Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04823v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deriving robust control policies for realistic urban navigation scenarios is not a trivial task. In an end-to-end approach, these policies must map high-dimensional images from the vehicle's cameras to low-level actions such as steering and throttle. While pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are based exclusively on engineered rewards, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment, which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive, such as autonomous driving. However, training deep networks directly from raw images on RL tasks is known to be unstable and troublesome. To deal with that, this work proposes a hierarchical GAIL-based architecture (hGAIL) which decouples representation learning from the driving task to solve the autonomous navigation of a vehicle. The proposed architecture consists of two modules: a GAN (Generative Adversarial Net) which generates an abstract mid-level input representation, which is the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) from the surroundings of the vehicle; and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based on the BEV predictions from the GAN as input. hGAIL is able to learn both the policy and the mid-level representation simultaneously as the agent interacts with the environment. Our experiments made in the CARLA simulation environment have shown that GAIL exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while hGAIL, after training exclusively on one city, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in 98% of the intersections of a new city not used in training phase.

      <title>Uncertainty Voting Ensemble for Imbalanced Deep Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data imbalance is ubiquitous when applying machine learning to real-world problems, particularly regression problems. If training data are imbalanced, the learning is dominated by the densely covered regions of the target distribution and the learned regressor tends to exhibit poor performance in sparsely covered regions. Beyond standard measures like oversampling or reweighting, there are two main approaches to handling learning from imbalanced data. For regression, recent work leverages the continuity of the distribution, while for classification, the trend has been to use ensemble methods, allowing some members to specialize in predictions for sparser regions. In our method, named UVOTE, we integrate recent advances in probabilistic deep learning with an ensemble approach for imbalanced regression. We replace traditional regression losses with negative log-likelihood, which also predicts sample-wise aleatoric uncertainty. Our experiments show that this loss function handles imbalance better. Additionally, we use the predicted aleatoric uncertainty values to fuse the predictions of different expert models in the ensemble, eliminating the need for a separate aggregation module. We compare our method with existing alternatives on multiple public benchmarks and show that UVOTE consistently outperforms the prior art, while at the same time producing better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

      <title>Counterpart Fairness -- Addressing Systematic between-group Differences in Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using machine learning (ML) to aid decision-making, it is critical to ensure that an algorithmic decision is fair and does not discriminate against specific individuals/groups, particularly those from underprivileged populations. Existing group fairness methods aim to ensure equal outcomes (such as loan approval rates) across groups delineated by protected variables like race or gender. However, these methods overlook the intricate, inherent differences among these groups that could influence outcomes. The confounding factors, which are non-protected variables but manifest systematic differences, can significantly affect fairness evaluation. Therefore, we recommend a more refined and comprehensive approach that accounts for both the systematic differences within groups and the multifaceted, intertwined confounding effects. We proposed a fairness metric based on counterparts (i.e., individuals who are similar with respect to the task of interest) from different groups, whose group identities cannot be distinguished algorithmically by exploring confounding factors. We developed a propensity-score-based method for identifying counterparts, avoiding the issue of comparing "oranges" with "apples". In addition, we introduced a counterpart-based statistical fairness index, called Counterpart-Fairness (CFair), to assess the fairness of ML models. Various empirical studies were conducted to validate the effectiveness of CFair.</description>

      <title>Large-Batch, Iteration-Efficient Neural Bayesian Design Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a powerful framework for optimizing black-box, expensive-to-evaluate functions. It is therefore an attractive tool for engineering design problems, typically involving multiple objectives. Thanks to the rapid advances in fabrication and measurement methods as well as parallel computing infrastructure, querying many design problems can be heavily parallelized. This class of problems challenges BO with an unprecedented setup where it has to deal with very large batches, shifting its focus from sample efficiency to iteration efficiency. We present a novel Bayesian optimization framework specifically tailored to address these limitations. Our key contribution is a highly scalable, sample-based acquisition function that performs a non-dominated sorting of not only the objectives but also their associated uncertainty. We show that our acquisition function in combination with different Bayesian neural network surrogates is effective in data-intensive environments with a minimal number of iterations. We demonstrate the superiority of our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizations. We perform our evaluation on two real-world problems -- airfoil design and 3D printing -- showcasing the applicability and efficiency of our approach.

      <title>Towards Understanding Neural Collapse: The Effects of Batch Normalization and Weight Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) is a geometric structure recently observed at the terminal phase of training deep neural networks, which states that last-layer feature vectors for the same class would "collapse" to a single point, while features of different classes become equally separated. We demonstrate that batch normalization (BN) and weight decay (WD) critically influence the emergence of NC. In the near-optimal loss regime, we establish an asymptotic lower bound on the emergence of NC that depends only on the WD value, training loss, and the presence of last-layer BN. Our experiments substantiate theoretical insights by showing that models demonstrate a stronger presence of NC with BN, appropriate WD values, lower loss, and lower last-layer feature norm. Our findings offer a novel perspective in studying the role of BN and WD in shaping neural network features.</description>

      <title>OceanNet: A principled neural operator-based digital twin for regional oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While data-driven approaches demonstrate great potential in atmospheric modeling and weather forecasting, ocean modeling poses distinct challenges due to complex bathymetry, land, vertical structure, and flow non-linearity. This study introduces OceanNet, a principled neural operator-based digital twin for ocean circulation. OceanNet uses a Fourier neural operator and predictor-evaluate-corrector integration scheme to mitigate autoregressive error growth and enhance stability over extended time scales. A spectral regularizer counteracts spectral bias at smaller scales. OceanNet is applied to the northwest Atlantic Ocean western boundary current (the Gulf Stream), focusing on the task of seasonal prediction for Loop Current eddies and the Gulf Stream meander. Trained using historical sea surface height (SSH) data, OceanNet demonstrates competitive forecast skill by outperforming SSH predictions by an uncoupled, state-of-the-art dynamical ocean model forecast, reducing computation by 500,000 times. These accomplishments demonstrate the potential of physics-inspired deep neural operators as cost-effective alternatives to high-resolution numerical ocean models.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Aware Augmentation for Enhanced Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in learning representations on graphs in recent years. To generate ideal augmentation views, the augmentation generation methods should preserve essential information while discarding less relevant details for downstream tasks. However, current augmentation methods usually involve random topology corruption in the spatial domain, which fails to adequately address information spread across different frequencies in the spectral domain. Our preliminary study highlights this issue, demonstrating that spatial random perturbations impact all frequency bands almost uniformly. Given that task-relevant information typically resides in specific spectral regions that vary across graphs, this one-size-fits-all approach can pose challenges. We argue that indiscriminate spatial random perturbation might unintentionally weaken task-relevant information, reducing its effectiveness.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose applying perturbations selectively, focusing on information specific to different frequencies across diverse graphs. In this paper, we present GASSER, a model that applies tailored perturbations to specific frequencies of graph structures in the spectral domain, guided by spectral hints. Through extensive experimentation and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the augmentation views generated by GASSER are adaptive, controllable, and intuitively aligned with the homophily ratios and spectrum of graph structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, paving the way for their application in autonomous driving (AD). This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</description>

Abstract: Soft Q-learning is a variation of Q-learning designed to solve entropy regularized Markov decision problems where an agent aims to maximize the entropy regularized value function. Despite its empirical success, there have been limited theoretical studies of soft Q-learning to date. This paper aims to offer a novel and unified finite-time, control-theoretic analysis of soft Q-learning algorithms. We focus on two types of soft Q-learning algorithms: one utilizing the log-sum-exp operator and the other employing the Boltzmann operator. By using dynamical switching system models, we derive novel finite-time error bounds for both soft Q-learning algorithms. We hope that our analysis will deepen the current understanding of soft Q-learning by establishing connections with switching system models and may even pave the way for new frameworks in the finite-time analysis of other reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>GCEPNet: Graph Convolution-Enhanced Expectation Propagation for Massive MIMO Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) detection is an important topic in wireless communication and various machine learning based methods have been developed recently for this task. Expectation Propagation (EP) and its variants are widely used for MIMO detection and have achieved the best performance. However, EP-based solvers fail to capture the correlation between unknown variables, leading to a loss of information, and in addition, they are computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that the real-valued system can be modeled as spectral signal convolution on graph, through which the correlation between unknown variables can be captured. Based on such analysis, we propose graph convolution-enhanced expectation propagation (GCEPNet). GCEPNet incorporates data-dependent attention scores into Chebyshev polynomial for powerful graph convolution with better generalization capacity. It enables a better estimation of the cavity distribution for EP and empirically achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIMO detection performance with much faster inference speed. To our knowledge, we are the first to shed light on the connection between the system model and graph convolution, and the first to design the data-dependent coefficients for graph convolution.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning Environments with Application to Healthcare Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple privacy-sensitive applications to leverage their dataset for a global model construction without any disclosure of the information. One of those domains is healthcare, where groups of silos collaborate in order to generate a global predictor with improved accuracy and generalization. However, the inherent challenge lies in the high heterogeneity of medical data, necessitating sophisticated techniques for assessment and compensation. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the mathematical formalization and taxonomy of heterogeneity within FL environments, focusing on the intricacies of medical data. In particular, we address the evaluation and comparison of the most popular FL algorithms with respect to their ability to cope with quantity-based, feature and label distribution-based heterogeneity. The goal is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the impact of data heterogeneity in FL systems for healthcare networks as well as a guideline on FL algorithm selection. Our research extends beyond existing studies by benchmarking seven of the most common FL algorithms against the unique challenges posed by medical data use cases. The paper targets the prediction of the risk of stroke recurrence through a set of tabular clinical reports collected by different federated hospital silos: data heterogeneity frequently encountered in this scenario and its impact on FL performance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using deep learning. We feed the model with fine-grid data after projecting it to the coarse-grid discretization. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the down-sampled fine-grid data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error from 120% to 25% in the velocity for simulations inside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver using an x8 coarser mesh. For simulations outside the training distribution, the error reduction in the velocities was about 50%. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimator selection and hyper-parameter tuning in off-policy evaluation. Although cross-validation is the most popular method for model selection in supervised learning, off-policy evaluation relies mostly on theory-based approaches, which provide only limited guidance to practitioners. We show how to use cross-validation for off-policy evaluation. This challenges a popular belief that cross-validation in off-policy evaluation is not feasible. We evaluate our method empirically and show that it addresses a variety of use cases.</description>

      <title>On Bits and Bandits: Quantifying the Regret-Information Trade-off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interactive decision-making tasks, information can be acquired by direct interactions, through receiving indirect feedback, and from external knowledgeable sources. We examine the trade-off between the information an agent accumulates and the regret it suffers. We show that information from external sources, measured in bits, can be traded off for regret, measured in reward. We invoke information-theoretic methods for obtaining regret lower bounds, that also allow us to easily re-derive several known lower bounds. We then generalize a variety of interactive decision-making tasks with external information to a new setting. Using this setting, we introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds that depend on the information an agent accumulates. These lower bounds also prove the near-optimality of Thompson sampling for Bayesian problems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these bounds in improving the performance of a question-answering task with large language models, allowing us to obtain valuable insights.</description>

      <title>What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning Towards A Real-Time Spacecraft Thermal Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Adversarial Imitation Learning Framework for Reliable &amp; Realtime Fleet Scheduling in Urban Air Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) presents the scope for a transformative shift in the domain of urban transportation. However, its widespread adoption and economic viability depends in part on the ability to optimally schedule the fleet of aircraft across vertiports in a UAM network, under uncertainties attributed to airspace congestion, changing weather conditions, and varying demands. This paper presents a comprehensive optimization formulation of the fleet scheduling problem, while also identifying the need for alternate solution approaches, since directly solving the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem is computationally prohibitive for daily fleet scheduling. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of using (graph) reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to train real-time executable policy models for fleet scheduling. However, such policies can often be brittle on out-of-distribution scenarios or edge cases. Moreover, training performance also deteriorates as the complexity (e.g., number of constraints) of the problem increases. To address these issues, this paper presents an imitation learning approach where the RL-based policy exploits expert demonstrations yielded by solving the exact optimization using a Genetic Algorithm. The policy model comprises Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoders that embed the space of vertiports and aircraft, Transformer networks to encode demand, passenger fare, and transport cost profiles, and a Multi-head attention (MHA) based decoder. Expert demonstrations are used through the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. Interfaced with a UAM simulation environment involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircrafts, in terms of the daily profits earned reward, the new imitative approach achieves better mean performance and remarkable improvement in the case of unseen worst-case scenarios, compared to pure RL results.</description>

      <title>Towards Neural Network based Cognitive Models of Dynamic Decision-Making by Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling human cognitive processes in dynamic decision-making tasks has been an endeavor in AI for a long time because such models can help make AI systems more intuitive, personalized, mitigate any human biases, and enhance training in simulation. Some initial work has attempted to utilize neural networks (and large language models) but often assumes one common model for all humans and aims to emulate human behavior in aggregate. However, the behavior of each human is distinct, heterogeneous, and relies on specific past experiences in certain tasks. For instance, consider two individuals responding to a phishing email: one who has previously encountered and identified similar threats may recognize it quickly, while another without such experience might fall for the scam. In this work, we build on Instance Based Learning (IBL) that posits that human decisions are based on similar situations encountered in the past. However, IBL relies on simple fixed form functions to capture the mapping from past situations to current decisions. To that end, we propose two new attention-based neural network models to have open form non-linear functions to model distinct and heterogeneous human decision-making in dynamic settings. We experiment with two distinct datasets gathered from human subject experiment data, one focusing on detection of phishing email by humans and another where humans act as attackers in a cybersecurity setting and decide on an attack option. We conducted extensive experiments with our two neural network models, IBL, and GPT3.5, and demonstrate that the neural network models outperform IBL significantly in representing human decision-making, while providing similar interpretability of human decisions as IBL. Overall, our work yields promising results for further use of neural networks in cognitive modeling of human decision making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging is an efficient empowerment technique in the machine learning community that does not require the collection of raw training data and does not require expensive computation. As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and 10+ machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions. A comprehensive list of papers about model merging is available at \url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Model-Merging-Methods-Theories-Applications}.</description>

      <title>Tracing Privacy Leakage of Language Models to Training Data via Adjusted Influence Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can include sensitive information from individuals and organizations, leading to potential privacy leakage. This work implements Influence Functions (IFs) to trace privacy leakage back to the training data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns of Language Models (LMs). However, we notice that current IFs struggle to accurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms, potentially overestimating their influence. When tracing the most influential samples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient norm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their influences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically Adjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient norms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most influential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing privacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two distinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and pre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning abilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly improves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96% to 73.71% on the PII-E dataset and 3.21% to 45.93% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA IFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs on real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness regardless prompt and response lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Hierarchical Urban Representation Learning for Commuting Flow Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commuting flow prediction is an essential task for municipal operations in the real world. Previous studies have revealed that it is feasible to estimate the commuting origin-destination (OD) demand within a city using multiple auxiliary data. However, most existing methods are not suitable to deal with a similar task at a large scale, namely within a prefecture or the whole nation, owing to the increased number of geographical units that need to be maintained. In addition, region representation learning is a universal approach for gaining urban knowledge for diverse metropolitan downstream tasks. Although many researchers have developed comprehensive frameworks to describe urban units from multi-source data, they have not clarified the relationship between the selected geographical elements. Furthermore, metropolitan areas naturally preserve ranked structures, like cities and their inclusive districts, which makes elucidating relations between cross-level urban units necessary. Therefore, we develop a heterogeneous graph-based model to generate meaningful region embeddings at multiple spatial resolutions for predicting different types of inter-level OD flows. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using real-world aggregated mobile phone datasets collected from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The results indicate that our proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of a uniform urban structure. We extend the understanding of predicted results using reasonable explanations to enhance the credibility of the model.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel framework for learning on CW-complex structured data points. Recent advances have discussed CW-complexes as ideal learning representations for problems in cheminformatics. However, there is a lack of available machine learning methods suitable for learning on CW-complexes. In this paper we develop notions of convolution and attention that are well defined for CW-complexes. These notions enable us to create the first Hodge informed neural network that can receive a CW-complex as input. We illustrate and interpret this framework in the context of supervised prediction.</description>

      <title>Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is necessary for many critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Moreover, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest four explanation spaces that each can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be readily adopted in existing platforms without any change to trained models or XAI methods. The code is available at https://github.com/shrezaei/TS-X-spaces.</description>

      <title>Last-Iterate Convergence of Payoff-Based Independent Learning in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two-player zero-sum matrix and stochastic games and develop learning dynamics that are payoff-based, convergent, rational, and symmetric between the two players. Specifically, the learning dynamics for matrix games are based on the smoothed best-response dynamics, while the learning dynamics for stochastic games build upon those for matrix games, with additional incorporation of the minimax value iteration. To our knowledge, our theoretical results present the first finite-sample analysis of such learning dynamics with last-iterate guarantees. In the matrix game setting, the results imply a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ to find the Nash distribution and a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-8})$ to find a Nash equilibrium. In the stochastic game setting, the results also imply a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-8})$ to find a Nash equilibrium. To establish these results, the main challenge is to handle stochastic approximation algorithms with multiple sets of coupled and stochastic iterates that evolve on (possibly) different time scales. To overcome this challenge, we developed a coupled Lyapunov-based approach, which may be of independent interest to the broader community studying the convergence behavior of stochastic approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stacked ensemble\-based mutagenicity prediction model using multiple modalities with graph attention network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutagenicity is a concern due to its association with genetic mutations which can result in a variety of negative consequences, including the development of cancer. Earlier identification of mutagenic compounds in the drug development process is therefore crucial for preventing the progression of unsafe candidates and reducing development costs. While computational techniques, especially machine learning models have become increasingly prevalent for this endpoint, they rely on a single modality. In this work, we introduce a novel stacked ensemble based mutagenicity prediction model which incorporate multiple modalities such as simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) and molecular graph. These modalities capture diverse information about molecules such as substructural, physicochemical, geometrical and topological. To derive substructural, geometrical and physicochemical information, we use SMILES, while topological information is extracted through a graph attention network (GAT) via molecular graph. Our model uses a stacked ensemble of machine learning classifiers to make predictions using these multiple features. We employ the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to determine the significance of each classifier and the most relevant features in the prediction. We demonstrate that our method surpasses SOTA methods on two standard datasets across various metrics. Notably, we achieve an area under the curve of 95.21\% on the Hansen benchmark dataset, affirming the efficacy of our method in predicting mutagenicity. We believe that this research will captivate the interest of both clinicians and computational biologists engaged in translational research.</description>

      <title>Robust Clustering on High-Dimensional Data with Stochastic Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional vector quantization (clustering) algorithms, particularly K-Means and its variant K-Means++, and explores the Stochastic Quantization (SQ) algorithm as a scalable alternative for high-dimensional unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. Some traditional clustering algorithms suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we trained Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</description>

      <title>The Role of Transformer Models in Advancing Blockchain Technology: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As blockchain technology rapidly evolves, the demand for enhanced efficiency, security, and scalability grows.Transformer models, as powerful deep learning architectures,have shown unprecedented potential in addressing various blockchain challenges. However, a systematic review of Transformer applications in blockchain is lacking. This paper aims to fill this research gap by surveying over 200 relevant papers, comprehensively reviewing practical cases and research progress of Transformers in blockchain applications. Our survey covers key areas including anomaly detection, smart contract security analysis, cryptocurrency prediction and trend analysis, and code summary generation. To clearly articulate the advancements of Transformers across various blockchain domains, we adopt a domain-oriented classification system, organizing and introducing representative methods based on major challenges in current blockchain research. For each research domain,we first introduce its background and objectives, then review previous representative methods and analyze their limitations,and finally introduce the advancements brought by Transformer models. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of utilizing Transformer, such as data privacy, model complexity, and real-time processing requirements. Finally, this article proposes future research directions, emphasizing the importance of exploring the Transformer architecture in depth to adapt it to specific blockchain applications, and discusses its potential role in promoting the development of blockchain technology. This review aims to provide new perspectives and a research foundation for the integrated development of blockchain technology and machine learning, supporting further innovation and application expansion of blockchain technology.</description>

      <title>Unified Convergence Theory of Stochastic and Variance-Reduced Cubic Newton Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic Cubic Newton methods for solving general possibly non-convex minimization problems. We propose a new framework, which we call the helper framework, that provides a unified view of the stochastic and variance-reduced second-order algorithms equipped with global complexity guarantees. It can also be applied to learning with auxiliary information. Our helper framework offers the algorithm designer high flexibility for constructing and analyzing the stochastic Cubic Newton methods, allowing arbitrary size batches, and the use of noisy and possibly biased estimates of the gradients and Hessians, incorporating both the variance reduction and the lazy Hessian updates. We recover the best-known complexities for the stochastic and variance-reduced Cubic Newton, under weak assumptions on the noise. A direct consequence of our theory is the new lazy stochastic second-order method, which significantly improves the arithmetic complexity for large dimension problems. We also establish complexity bounds for the classes of gradient-dominated objectives, that include convex and strongly convex problems. For Auxiliary Learning, we show that using a helper (auxiliary function) can outperform training alone if a given similarity measure is small.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Covariance Estimation via Regression on the Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multifidelity estimator of covariance matrices formulated as the solution to a regression problem on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The estimator is positive definite by construction, and the Mahalanobis distance minimized to obtain it possesses properties enabling practical computation. We show that our manifold regression multifidelity (MRMF) covariance estimator is a maximum likelihood estimator under a certain error model on manifold tangent space. More broadly, we show that our Riemannian regression framework encompasses existing multifidelity covariance estimators constructed from control variates. We demonstrate via numerical examples that the MRMF estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators. Furthermore, preservation of positive definiteness ensures that our estimator is compatible with downstream tasks, such as data assimilation and metric learning, in which this property is essential.</description>

      <title>Implementation of The Future of Drug Discovery: QuantumBased Machine Learning Simulation (QMLS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) phase of drug development is a lengthy and costly process. To revolutionize this process, we introduce our new concept QMLS to shorten the whole R&amp;D phase to three to six months and decrease the cost to merely fifty to eighty thousand USD. For Hit Generation, Machine Learning Molecule Generation (MLMG) generates possible hits according to the molecular structure of the target protein while the Quantum Simulation (QS) filters molecules from the primary essay based on the reaction and binding effectiveness with the target protein. Then, For Lead Optimization, the resultant molecules generated and filtered from MLMG and QS are compared, and molecules that appear as a result of both processes will be made into dozens of molecular variations through Machine Learning Molecule Variation (MLMV), while others will only be made into a few variations. Lastly, all optimized molecules would undergo multiple rounds of QS filtering with a high standard for reaction effectiveness and safety, creating a few dozen pre-clinical-trail-ready drugs. This paper is based on our first paper, where we pitched the concept of machine learning combined with quantum simulations. In this paper we will go over the detailed design and framework of QMLS, including MLMG, MLMV, and QS.</description>

      <title>WhiteFox: White-Box Compiler Fuzzing Empowered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compiler correctness is crucial, as miscompilation can falsify program behaviors, leading to serious consequences. Fuzzing has been studied to uncover compiler defects. However, compiler fuzzing remains challenging: Existing arts focus on black- and grey-box fuzzing, which generates tests without sufficient understanding of internal compiler behaviors. Meanwhile, traditional white-box techniques, like symbolic execution, are computationally inapplicable to the giant codebase of compilers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation/understanding tasks. Nonetheless, guiding LLMs with compiler source-code information remains a missing piece of research in compiler testing.
  To this end, we propose WhiteFox, the first white-box compiler fuzzer using LLMs with source-code information to test compiler optimization, with a spotlight on detecting deep logic bugs in the deep learning (DL) compilers. WhiteFox adopts a multi-agent framework: an LLM-based analysis agent examines the low-level optimization source code and produces requirements on the high-level test programs that can trigger the optimization; an LLM-based generation agent produces test programs based on the summarized requirements. Additionally, optimization-triggering tests are used as feedback to enhance the generation on the fly. Our evaluation on the three most popular DL compilers (i.e., PyTorch Inductor, TensorFlow-XLA, and TensorFlow Lite) shows WhiteFox can generate high-quality test programs to exercise deep optimizations, practicing up to 8X more than state-of-the-art fuzzers. WhiteFox has found 101 bugs for the DL compilers, with 92 confirmed as previously unknown and 70 fixed. WhiteFox has been acknowledged by the PyTorch team and is being incorporated into its development workflow. Beyond DL compilers, WhiteFox can also be adapted for compilers in different domains.</description>

      <title>MimicTouch: Leveraging Multi-modal Human Tactile Demonstrations for Contact-rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is critical to fine-grained, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as insertion and assembly. Prior research has shown the possibility of learning tactile-guided policy from teleoperated demonstration data. However, to provide the demonstration, human users often rely on visual feedback to control the robot. This creates a gap between the sensing modality used for controlling the robot (visual) and the modality of interest (tactile). To bridge this gap, we introduce "MimicTouch", a novel framework for learning policies directly from demonstrations provided by human users with their hands. The key innovations are i) a human tactile data collection system which collects multi-modal tactile dataset for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy, ii) an imitation learning-based framework for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy through such data, and iii) an online residual RL framework to bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot gripper. Through comprehensive experiments, we highlight the efficacy of utilizing human's tactile-guided control strategy to resolve contact-rich manipulation tasks.

      <title>FRAC-Q-Learning: A Reinforcement Learning with Boredom Avoidance Processes for Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reinforcement learning algorithms have often been applied to social robots. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms were not optimized for the use of social robots, and consequently they may bore users. We proposed a new reinforcement learning method specialized for the social robot, the FRAC-Q-learning, that can avoid user boredom. The proposed algorithm consists of a forgetting process in addition to randomizing and categorizing processes. This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional Q-learning. Therefore, the FRAC-Q-learning can contribute to develop a social robot that will not bore users. The proposed algorithm has a potential to apply for Web-based communication and educational systems. This paper presents the entire process, detailed implementation and a detailed evaluation method of the of the FRAC-Q-learning for the first time.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Training of Graph Neural Networks for Optimal Markov-Chain Partitioning Using the Kemeny Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle to capture the complex relationships within graphs and generalise to arbitrary clustering criteria. The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a powerful framework for learning representations of graph data provides new approaches to solving the problem. Previous work has shown GNNs to be capable of proposing partitionings using a variety of criteria, however, these approaches have not yet been extended to work on Markov chains or kinetic networks. These arise frequently in the study of molecular systems and are of particular interest to the biochemical modelling community. In this work, we propose several GNN-based architectures to tackle the graph partitioning problem for Markov Chains described as kinetic networks. This approach aims to minimize how much a proposed partitioning changes the Kemeny constant. We propose using an encoder-decoder architecture and show how simple GraphSAGE-based GNNs with linear layers can outperform much larger and more expressive attention-based models in this context. As a proof of concept, we first demonstrate the method's ability to cluster randomly connected graphs. We also use a linear chain architecture corresponding to a 1D free energy profile as our kinetic network. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on a data set derived from molecular dynamics. We compare the performance of our method to other partitioning techniques such as PCCA+. We explore the importance of feature and hyperparameter selection and propose a general strategy for large-scale parallel training of GNNs for discovering optimal graph partitionings.</description>

      <title>Developing A Multi-Agent and Self-Adaptive Framework with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been adapted as reactive agents to quickly learn and respond with new investment strategies for portfolio management under the highly turbulent financial market environments in recent years. In many cases, due to the very complex correlations among various financial sectors, and the fluctuating trends in different financial markets, a deep or reinforcement learning based agent can be biased in maximising the total returns of the newly formulated investment portfolio while neglecting its potential risks under the turmoil of various market conditions in the global or regional sectors. Accordingly, a multi-agent and self-adaptive framework namely the MASA is proposed in which a sophisticated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach is adopted through two cooperating and reactive agents to carefully and dynamically balance the trade-off between the overall portfolio returns and their potential risks. Besides, a very flexible and proactive agent as the market observer is integrated into the MASA framework to provide some additional information on the estimated market trends as valuable feedbacks for multi-agent RL approach to quickly adapt to the ever-changing market conditions. The obtained empirical results clearly reveal the potential strengths of our proposed MASA framework based on the multi-agent RL approach against many well-known RL-based approaches on the challenging data sets of the CSI 300, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 indexes over the past 10 years. More importantly, our proposed MASA framework shed lights on many possible directions for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided World Models: A Model-Based Approach to AI Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Language-Guided World Models (LWMs) -- probabilistic models that can simulate environments by reading texts. Agents equipped with these models provide humans with more extensive and efficient control, allowing them to simultaneously alter agent behaviors in multiple tasks via natural verbal communication. In this work, we take initial steps in developing robust LWMs that can generalize to compositionally novel language descriptions. We design a challenging world modeling benchmark based on the game of MESSENGER (Hanjie et al., 2021), featuring evaluation settings that require varying degrees of compositional generalization. Our experiments reveal the lack of generalizability of the state-of-the-art Transformer model, as it offers marginal improvements in simulation quality over a no-text baseline. We devise a more robust model by fusing the Transformer with the EMMA attention mechanism (Hanjie et al., 2021). Our model substantially outperforms the Transformer and approaches the performance of a model with an oracle semantic parsing and grounding capability. To demonstrate the practicality of this model in improving AI safety and transparency, we simulate a scenario in which the model enables an agent to present plans to a human before execution, and to revise plans based on their language feedback.</description>

      <title>AICAttack: Adversarial Image Captioning Attack with Attention-Based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning research have shown remarkable achievements across many tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). At the intersection of CV and NLP is the problem of image captioning, where the related models' robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well studied. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack strategy, AICAttack (Attention-based Image Captioning Attack), designed to attack image captioning models through subtle perturbations on images. Operating within a black-box attack scenario, our algorithm requires no access to the target model's architecture, parameters, or gradient information. We introduce an attention-based candidate selection mechanism that identifies the optimal pixels to attack, followed by a customised differential evolution method to optimise the perturbations of pixels' RGB values. We demonstrate AICAttack's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against multiple victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current leading-edge techniques by achieving consistently higher attack success rates.</description>

      <title>Constrained Decoding for Fill-in-the-Middle Code Language Models via Efficient Left and Right Quotienting of Context-Sensitive Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are powerful tools for program synthesis and advanced auto-completion, but come with no guarantee that their output code is syntactically correct. This paper contributes an incremental parser that allows early rejection of syntactically incorrect code, as well as efficient detection of complete programs for fill-in-the-middle (FIM) tasks. We extend the Earley parsing algorithm to allow for left and right quotients of context-free grammars, and develop methods to handle quotienting of several context-sensitive features present in the grammars of many common programming languages. The result of these contributions is an efficient, general, and well-grounded method for left and right quotient parsing.
  To validate our theoretical contributions -- and the effectiveness of certain design decisions -- we evaluate our method on the particularly difficult case of FIM completion for Python 3, with syntax-correctness constraints. Our results demonstrate that constrained generation can significantly reduce the incidence of syntax errors in recommended code.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Frequency Domain Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-parametric frequency-domain system identification from a finite-sample perspective. We assume an open loop scenario where the excitation input is periodic and consider the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE), where the goal is to estimate the frequency response at certain desired (evenly-spaced) frequencies, given input-output samples. We show that under sub-Gaussian colored noise (in time-domain) and stability assumptions, the ETFE estimates are concentrated around the true values. The error rate is of the order of $\mathcal{O}((d_{\mathrm{u}}+\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{u}}d_{\mathrm{y}}})\sqrt{M/N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, where $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total number of samples, $M$ is the number of desired frequencies, and $d_{\mathrm{u}},\,d_{\mathrm{y}}$ are the dimensions of the input and output signals respectively. This rate remains valid for general irrational transfer functions and does not require a finite order state-space representation. By tuning $M$, we obtain a $N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/3}$ finite-sample rate for learning the frequency response over all frequencies in the $ \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. Our result draws upon an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to semi-infinite matrices. We study the finite-sample behavior of ETFE in simulations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of soil fertility parameters using USB-microscope imagery and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the use of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry and soil image analysis for rapid soil fertility assessment, with a focus on key indicators such as available boron (B), organic carbon (OC), available manganese (Mn), available sulfur (S), and the sulfur availability index (SAI). A total of 1,133 soil samples from diverse agro-climatic zones in Eastern India were analyzed. The research integrated color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results showed that combining image features (IFs) with AVs significantly improved prediction accuracy for available B (R2 = 0.80) and OC (R2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further enhanced predictions for available Mn and SAI, with R2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study highlights the potential of integrating these technologies to offer rapid, cost-effective soil testing methods, paving the way for more advanced predictive models and a deeper understanding of soil fertility. Future work should explore the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset, incorporating soils from a wider range of agro-climatic zones under field conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluations of Machine Learning Privacy Defenses are Misleading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical defenses for machine learning privacy forgo the provable guarantees of differential privacy in the hope of achieving higher utility while resisting realistic adversaries. We identify severe pitfalls in existing empirical privacy evaluations (based on membership inference attacks) that result in misleading conclusions. In particular, we show that prior evaluations fail to characterize the privacy leakage of the most vulnerable samples, use weak attacks, and avoid comparisons with practical differential privacy baselines. In 5 case studies of empirical privacy defenses, we find that prior evaluations underestimate privacy leakage by an order of magnitude. Under our stronger evaluation, none of the empirical defenses we study are competitive with a properly tuned, high-utility DP-SGD baseline (with vacuous provable guarantees).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Commute-Time-Optimised Graphs for GNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore graph rewiring methods that optimise commute time. Recent graph rewiring approaches facilitate long-range interactions in sparse graphs, making such rewirings commute-time-optimal on average. However, when an expert prior exists on which node pairs should or should not interact, a superior rewiring would favour short commute times between these privileged node pairs. We construct two synthetic datasets with known priors reflecting realistic settings, and use these to motivate two bespoke rewiring methods that incorporate the known prior. We investigate the regimes where our rewiring improves test performance on the synthetic datasets. Finally, we perform a case study on a real-world citation graph to investigate the practical implications of our work.</description>

Abstract: In the search for more effective education, there is a widespread effort to develop better approaches to personalize student education. Unassisted, educators often do not have time or resources to personally support every student in a given classroom. Motivated by this issue, and by recent advancements in artificial intelligence, this paper presents a general-purpose framework for personalized student support, applicable to any virtual educational system such as a serious game or an intelligent tutoring system. To fit any educational situation, we apply ontologies for their semantic organization, combining them with data collection considerations and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The result is a modular system that can be adapted to any virtual educational software to provide useful personalized assistance to students.</description>

      <title>Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque; in particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information: byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with example data for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o and Mistral NeMo's tokenizers are much more multilingual than their predecessors, training on 39% and 47% non-English language data, respectively; Llama 3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Wealth Index Predictions in Africa between three Multi-Source Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poverty map inference is a critical area of research, with growing interest in both traditional and modern techniques, ranging from regression models to convolutional neural networks applied to tabular data, images, and networks. Despite extensive focus on the validation of training phases, the scrutiny of final predictions remains limited. Here, we compare the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) inferred by Chi et al. (2022) with the International Wealth Index (IWI) inferred by Lee and Braithwaite (2022) and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. (2023) across six Sub-Saharan African countries. Our analysis focuses on identifying trends and discrepancies in wealth predictions over time. Our results show that the predictions by Chi et al. and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. align with general GDP trends, with differences expected due to the distinct time-frames of the training sets. However, predictions by Lee and Braithwaite diverge significantly, indicating potential issues with the validity of the model. These discrepancies highlight the need for policymakers and stakeholders in Africa to rigorously audit models that predict wealth, especially those used for decision-making on the ground. These and other techniques require continuous verification and refinement to enhance their reliability and ensure that poverty alleviation strategies are well-founded.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD Dataset: A Comparative Analysis for Automotive Controller Area Network (CAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of digital devices in modern vehicles has revolutionized automotive technology, enhancing safety and the overall driving experience. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is a central system for managing in-vehicle communication between the electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN protocol poses security challenges due to inherent vulnerabilities, lacking encryption and authentication, which, combined with an expanding attack surface, necessitates robust security measures. In response to this challenge, numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed and deployed. Nonetheless, an open, comprehensive, and realistic dataset to test the effectiveness of such IDSs remains absent in the existing literature. This paper addresses this gap by considering the latest ROAD dataset, containing stealthy and sophisticated injections. The methodology involves dataset labelling and the implementation of both state-of-the-art deep learning models and traditional machine learning models to show the discrepancy in performance between the datasets most commonly used in the literature and the ROAD dataset, a more realistic alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: De novo molecule design has become a highly active research area, advanced significantly through the use of state-of-the-art generative models. Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Human-AI Collaboration: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback and Physics Knowledge for Safe Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, developing safe and trustworthy autonomous driving policies remains a significant challenge. Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has attracted substantial attention due to its potential to enhance training safety and sampling efficiency. Nevertheless, existing RLHF-enabled methods often falter when faced with imperfect human demonstrations, potentially leading to training oscillations or even worse performance than rule-based approaches. Inspired by the human learning process, we propose Physics-enhanced Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (PE-RLHF). This novel framework synergistically integrates human feedback (e.g., human intervention and demonstration) and physics knowledge (e.g., traffic flow model) into the training loop of reinforcement learning. The key advantage of PE-RLHF is its guarantee that the learned policy will perform at least as well as the given physics-based policy, even when human feedback quality deteriorates, thus ensuring trustworthy safety improvements. PE-RLHF introduces a Physics-enhanced Human-AI (PE-HAI) collaborative paradigm for dynamic action selection between human and physics-based actions, employs a reward-free approach with a proxy value function to capture human preferences, and incorporates a minimal intervention mechanism to reduce the cognitive load on human mentors. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios demonstrate that PE-RLHF significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in safety, efficiency, and generalizability, even with varying quality of human feedback. The philosophy behind PE-RLHF not only advances autonomous driving technology but can also offer valuable insights for other safety-critical domains.

      <title>A causal viewpoint on prediction model performance under changes in case-mix: discrimination and calibration respond differently for prognosis and diagnosis predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction models inform important clinical decisions, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The predictive performance of these models is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. However, changes in the distribution of the data impact model performance. In health-care, a typical change is a shift in case-mix: for example, for cardiovascular risk management, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a specialist in a tertiary hospital.
  This work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the case for prognosis predictions), calibration remains stable under case-mix shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination remains stable, but calibration does not.
  A simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. This framework provides critical insights for evaluating and deploying prediction models across different clinical settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causal structure of the prediction task.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>

      <title>LinFusion: 1 GPU, 1 Minute, 16K Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern diffusion models, particularly those utilizing a Transformer-based UNet for denoising, rely heavily on self-attention operations to manage complex spatial relationships, thus achieving impressive generation performance. However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and identify two key features-attention normalization and non-causal inference-that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion delivers satisfactory zero-shot cross-resolution generation performance, generating high-resolution images like 16K resolution. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, requiring no adaptation efforts. Codes are available at https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Implicit Representation of Accessibility for Multi-Axis Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</description>

Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers.Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning. As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario.The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it.Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</description>
