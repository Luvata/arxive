      <title>Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports, including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability. Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM) encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone. LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further research in medical image-text representation learning.</description>

      <title>ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (&lt;1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding.</description>

      <title>M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed, multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification, text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead, hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times, with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5 Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over advertising data.</description>

      <title>ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion, a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning (MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications requiring high interpretability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.</description>

      <title>RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible &amp; Faithful T2I Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is, solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.</description>

      <title>Which Direction to Choose? An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.</description>

      <title>How Good are Foundation Models in Step-by-Step Embodied Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context. While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and (iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>CoDoL: Conditional Domain Prompt Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as the out-of-distribution generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

      <title>LowDiff: Efficient Diffusion Sampling with Low-Resolution Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process. In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1 produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together with substantial efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>MaskAttn-SDXL: Controllable Region-Level Text-To-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity. These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>RaceGAN: A Framework for Preserving Individuality while Converting Racial Information for Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black) when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each ethnic group.</description>

      <title>Generating Part-Based Global Explanations Via Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images. Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Causal Fingerprints of AI Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations. We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection.</description>

      <title>NeuroRAD-FM: A Foundation Model for Neuro-Oncology with Distributionally Robust Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function, enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones (BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers (MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT), continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to 0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69). For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647 to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.</description>

      <title>ORCA: Agentic Reasoning For Hallucination and Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models (less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense, and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\% to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE, ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to +48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Region-Aware Deformable Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small 1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly attention-based methods.</description>

      <title>CAGE: Continuity-Aware edGE Network Unlocks Robust Floorplan Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a \textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native} edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges. We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC), but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC). We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multimodal Dataset Distillation via Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>OpenViGA: Video Generation for Automotive Driving Scenes by Streamlining and Fine-Tuning Open Source Models with Public Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These approaches often utilize large models that require significant training resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale. Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of algorithmic latency.</description>

      <title>Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology (CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&amp;E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can help ensure effective development and deployment.</description>

      <title>SmolRGPT: Efficient Spatial Reasoning for Warehouse Environments with 600M Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters, SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial reasoning capabilities.

      <title>Lynx: Towards High-Fidelity Personalized Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT) foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance, competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the state of personalized video generation.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Mitigation via Invertible Pruning Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an \emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.</description>

      <title>MEC-Quant: Maximum Entropy Coding for Extremely Low Bit Quantization-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation, especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.</description>

      <title>GUI-ARP: Enhancing Grounding with Adaptive Region Perception for GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC), GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9% on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.</description>

      <title>SAMPO:Scale-wise Autoregression with Motion PrOmpt for generative world models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However, existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise \textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt (\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism. Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: Enhancing Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition with Non-Verbal Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis.

      <title>Enhancing Sa2VA for Referent Video Object Segmentation: 2nd Solution for 7th LSVOS RVOS Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and (2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without any additional training, our approach achieves a J&amp;F score of 64.14% on the MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025.</description>

      <title>MS-GS: Multi-Appearance Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Cross-Modal Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce \textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that \textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts. The code is available at https://github.com/lt-0123/Diff-Feat.</description>

      <title>From Development to Deployment of AI-assisted Telehealth and Screening for Vision- and Hearing-threatening diseases in resource-constrained settings: Field Observations, Challenges and Way Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability, especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings. Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.</description>

      <title>DC-Mamba: Bi-temporal deformable alignment and scale-sparse enhancement for remote sensing change detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models (SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1) Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and (2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets. Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our "align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in RSCD.</description>

      <title>BTL-UI: Blink-Think-Link Reasoning Model for GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</description>

      <title>Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning for Fake News Detection in Short Videos Using Linguistically Verified Data and Heterogeneous Modality Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV (VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in combating misinformation.</description>

      <title>EyePCR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Fine-Grained Perception, Knowledge Comprehension and Clinical Reasoning in Ophthalmic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.</description>

      <title>TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>PCSR: Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement for Noisy Correspondence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency. Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly, we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval robustness under noisy supervision.</description>

      <title>pFedSAM: Personalized Federated Learning of Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities; however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts) component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.</description>

      <title>UNIV: Unified Foundation Model for Infrared and Visible Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly, particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions. Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+ of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks.

      <title>GS-Scale: Unlocking Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting Training via Host Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration, reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.</description>

      <title>A PCA Based Model for Surface Reconstruction from Incomplete Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats. View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting. Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena, including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.</description>

      <title>Layout Stroke Imitation: A Layout Guided Handwriting Stroke Generation for Style Imitation with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks.</description>

      <title>Saccadic Vision for Fine-Grained Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map, from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.</description>

      <title>SCENEFORGE: Enhancing 3D-text alignment with Structured Scene Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.</description>

      <title>ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Pyramid Token Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models via Region, Token, and Instruction-Guided Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.</description>

      <title>SGMAGNet: A Baseline Model for 3D Cloud Phase Structure Reconstruction on a New Passive Active Satellite Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.</description>

      <title>Toward Medical Deepfake Detection: A Comprehensive Dataset and Novel Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce \textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical modalities.</description>

      <title>TrueMoE: Dual-Routing Mixture of Discriminative Experts for Synthetic Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content. However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE, a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior generalization and robustness.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.</description>

      <title>FloorSAM: SAM-Guided Floorplan Reconstruction with Semantic-Geometric Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

      <title>Simulated Cortical Magnification Supports Self-Supervised Object Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more realistic and performant.</description>

      <title>MCOD: The First Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations: Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty. Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.</description>

      <title>Overview of PlantCLEF 2024: multi-species plant identification in vegetation plot images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists, helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled) multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants and the results achieved.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Models as Differentiable Semantic and Spatial Rewards for Text-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings, using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark. Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.</description>

      <title>Enriched Feature Representation and Motion Prediction Module for MOSEv2 Track of 7th LSVOS Challenge: 3rd Place Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant, achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion prediction for robust video object segmentation.

      <title>Ideal Registration? Segmentation is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation, we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23% Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios (cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.</description>

      <title>CBPNet: A Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network for Alleviating Plasticity Loss on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention. In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks. On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating our approach.</description>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa) method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND, JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%, and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zmoka-zht/FoBa.</description>

      <title>Minimal Semantic Sufficiency Meets Unsupervised Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios. Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.</description>

      <title>TASAM: Terrain-and-Aware Segment Anything Model for Temporal-Scale Remote Sensing Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.</description>

      <title>ChronoForge-RL: Chronological Forging through Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames. Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B parameter alternatives.</description>

      <title>CIDER: A Causal Cure for Brand-Obsessed Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the development of trustworthy generative AI.</description>

      <title>Boosting Active Learning with Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>LC-SLab -- An Object-based Deep Learning Framework for Large-scale Land Cover Classification from Satellite Imagery and Sparse In-situ Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the framework's practical utility.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Visual Grounding in 3D Gaussians via View Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However, existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose \underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in https://github.com/leviome/GVR_demos.</description>

      <title>ENSAM: an efficient foundation model for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation. ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training. ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of 2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol), surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation quality.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Learning for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>RACap: Relation-Aware Prompting for Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes. However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning, which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness. Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters, achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models.</description>

      <title>RangeSAM: Leveraging Visual Foundation Models for Range-View repesented LiDAR segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</description>

      <title>Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning for Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT) framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension, Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions. Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves second on the Middlebury benchmark.

      <description>arXiv:2509.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures, enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes. In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning. Code is available at https://github.com/DCalhas/deep_feedback_models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories, which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring 3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view setting.</description>

      <title>PAN: Pillars-Attention-Based Network for 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50, while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset for the same category.</description>

      <title>A multi-temporal multi-spectral attention-augmented deep convolution neural network with contrastive learning for crop yield prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods. MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8, and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions, potentially improving crop yields.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Depth: Explainability Assessment in Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore, we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>CoPAD : Multi-source Trajectory Fusion and Cooperative Trajectory Prediction with Anchor-oriented Decoder in V2X Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving. However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Sharper Object Boundaries in Self-Supervised Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding, but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal data fusion is a key approach for enhancing diagnosis in medical applications. We propose an asymmetric fusion strategy starting from a primary modality and integrating secondary modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific information. Validated on a dataset of 239 patients with echocardiographic time series and tabular records, our model outperforms existing methods, achieving an AUC over 90%.

      <title>Towards Robust Visual Continual Learning with Multi-Prototype Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes. Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for language-guided continual learning.</description>

      <title>DistillMatch: Leveraging Knowledge Distillation from Vision Foundation Model for Multimodal Image Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis. However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets, existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities, including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations. Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation. Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public datasets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Deep Multi-view Clustering via Causal Learning with Partially Aligned Cross-view Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work, we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.</description>

      <title>GLip: A Global-Local Integrated Progressive Framework for Robust Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Point Cloud Surface Reconstruction using B-Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Language-Instructed Reasoning for Group Activity Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level &lt;ACT&gt; token and multiple cluster-specific &lt;GROUP&gt; tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the &lt;ACT&gt; token and &lt;GROUP&gt; tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the &lt;ACT&gt; token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.</description>

      <title>See&amp;Trek: Training-Free Spatial Prompting for Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SEE&amp;TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&amp;TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&amp;GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &amp;T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion for Self-supervised Real-World Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective self-supervised solution for real-world denoising.

      <title>AdaSports-Traj: Role- and Domain-Aware Adaptation for Multi-Agent Trajectory Modeling in Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g., players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.</description>

      <title>SegDINO3D: 3D Instance Segmentation Empowered by Both Image-Level and Object-Level 2D Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</description>

      <title>RadarGaussianDet3D: An Efficient and Effective Gaussian-based 3D Detector with 4D Automotive Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>BaseReward: A Strong Baseline for Multimodal Reward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model} and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Recovering Parametric Scenes from Very Few Time-of-Flight Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors. These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.</description>

      <title>AcT2I: Evaluating and Improving Action Depiction in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.</description>

      <title>Pointing to a Llama and Call it a Camel: On the Sycophancy of Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior. While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models (LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning, allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions, without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.</description>

      <title>Robust Vision-Language Models via Tensor Decomposition: A Defense Against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining. By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\% performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%. Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical, plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.</description>

      <title>UniMRSeg: Unified Modality-Relax Segmentation via Hierarchical Self-Supervised Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. %
First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. %
Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.</description>

      <title>Fast OTSU Thresholding Using Bisection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.</description>

      <title>MANZANO: A Simple and Scalable Unified Multimodal Model with a Hybrid Vision Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.</description>

      <title>Video2Roleplay: A Multimodal Dataset and Framework for Video-Guided Role-playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset, we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations. Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning, and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial workflows demand adaptive and trustworthy assistance that can operate under limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy constraints. In this work, we present MICA (Multi-Agent Industrial Coordination Assistant), a perception-grounded and speech-interactive system that delivers real-time guidance for assembly, troubleshooting, part queries, and maintenance. MICA coordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker, to ensure accurate and compliant support. To achieve robust step understanding, we introduce Adaptive Step Fusion (ASF), which dynamically blends expert reasoning with online adaptation from natural speech feedback. Furthermore, we establish a new multi-agent coordination benchmark across representative task categories and propose evaluation metrics tailored to industrial assistance, enabling systematic comparison of different coordination topologies. Our experiments demonstrate that MICA consistently improves task success, reliability, and responsiveness over baseline structures, while remaining deployable on practical offline hardware. Together, these contributions highlight MICA as a step toward deployable, privacy-preserving multi-agent assistants for dynamic factory environments. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Kratos-Wen/MICA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Global Pre-fixing, Local Adjusting: A Simple yet Effective Contrastive Strategy for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements, their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing, \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular \textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method \textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Analysis Plug-and-Play Methods for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization. To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms, we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Visual Cortical Lateral Connection Properties into CNN: Recurrent Activation and Excitatory-Inhibitory Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their modern updates such as the ResNet are heavily inspired by the mammalian visual system. These models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas). However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2) separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect our approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better understand the principles of visual cortical computation.</description>

      <title>Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks. The project website is at https://zinanlin.me/blogs/latent_zoning_networks.html.</description>

      <title>Prostate Capsule Segmentation from Micro-Ultrasound Images using Adaptive Focal Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images, addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility, addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Gated Deformable Network for Breast Tumor Segmentation in MR Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module (U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor delineation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable whole slide imaging (WSI) hinges on image quality,yet staining artefacts, defocus, and cellular degradations are common. We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with &gt;92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</description>

      <title>QWD-GAN: Quality-aware Wavelet-driven GAN for Unsupervised Medical Microscopy Images Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging, especially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task faces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition conditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical application demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques have demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in preserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing clinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach introduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and a dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps with original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy image datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency information. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly compatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware, wavelet-driven GAN denoising model is termed as QWD-GAN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods. Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data. Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Tail Learning in Latent Space by sampling Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets. Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective approach.</description>

      <title>MoAngelo: Motion-Aware Neural Surface Reconstruction for Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology. We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset.</description>

      <title>From Data to Diagnosis: A Large, Comprehensive Bone Marrow Dataset and AI Methods for Childhood Leukemia Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process, from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts. While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Missing Piece: A Case for Pre-Training in 3D Medical Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D object detection rely on 2D medical data or natural image pre-training, failing to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers. Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance across various tasks and datasets. Notably, reconstruction-based self-supervised pre-training outperforms supervised pre-training, while contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit for 3D medical object detection.

      <title>CoReVLA: A Dual-Stage End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework for Long-Tail Scenarios via Collect-and-Refine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions. Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and 15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences.

      <title>SLaM-DiMM: Shared Latent Modeling for Diffusion Based Missing Modality Synthesis in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging (T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

      <title>FMD-TransUNet: Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation Based on Frequency Domain Multi-Axis Representation Learning and Dual Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information, and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.</description>

      <title>MTS-DMAE: Dual-Masked Autoencoder for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Probabilistic and Robust Inverse Solver with Measurement-Conditioned Diffusion Prior for Blind Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are now commonly used to solve inverse problems in computational imaging. However, most diffusion-based inverse solvers require complete knowledge of the forward operator to be used. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic and robust inverse solver with measurement-conditioned diffusion prior (PRISM) to effectively address blind inverse problems. PRISM offers a technical advancement over current methods by incorporating a powerful measurement-conditioned diffusion model into a theoretically principled posterior sampling scheme. Experiments on blind image deblurring validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superior performance of PRISM over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and blur kernel recovery.</description>

      <title>DiffusionNFT: Online Diffusion Reinforcement with Forward Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance via Online Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales. This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Enhancing LIME with Hierarchical Features and Segmentation Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07733v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular XAI framework for unraveling decision-making processes in vision machine-learning models. The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

      <title>Navigate Beyond Shortcuts: Debiased Learning through the Lens of Neural Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have noted an intriguing phenomenon termed Neural Collapse, that is, when the neural networks establish the right correlation between feature spaces and the training targets, their last-layer features, together with the classifier weights, will collapse into a stable and symmetric structure. In this paper, we extend the investigation of Neural Collapse to the biased datasets with imbalanced attributes. We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased, non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training, which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification, we follow the recent inspiration of prime training, and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure, the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method induces better convergence properties during training, and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on both synthetic and real-world biased datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/RachelWolowitz/Navigate-beyond-Shortcuts/tree/main.</description>

      <title>A re-calibration method for object detection with multi-modal alignment bias in autonomous driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving has achieved great breakthroughs due to the usage of fusing complementary information from different sensors. The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera was always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but mechanical vibration, road bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As there is relatively limited research on the impact of calibration on fusion detection performance, multi-sensor detection methods with flexible calibration dependency have remained a key objective. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of the SOTA EPNet++ detection framework and prove that even slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. To address this vulnerability, we propose a re-calibration model to re-calibrate the misalignment in detection tasks. This model integrates LiDAR point cloud, camera image, and initial calibration matrix as inputs, generating re-calibrated bias through semantic segmentation guidance and a tailored loss function design. The re-calibration model can operate with existing detection algorithms, enhancing both robustness against calibration bias and overall object detection performance. Our approach establishes a foundational methodology for maintaining reliability in multi-modal perception systems under real-world calibration uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Assessing invariance to affine transformations in image quality metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subjective image quality metrics are usually evaluated according to the correlation with human opinion in databases with distortions that may appear in digital media. However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones.
  In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate any image quality metric by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. Here, invariance refers to the fact that certain distances should be neglected if their values are below a threshold. This is what we call invisibility threshold of a metric. Our methodology consists of two elements: (1) the determination of a visibility threshold in a subjective representation common to every metric, and (2) a transduction from the distance values of the metric and this common representation. This common representation is based on subjective ratings of readily available image quality databases. We determine the threshold in such common representation (the first element) using accurate psychophysics. Then, the transduction (the second element) can be trivially fitted for any metric: with the provided threshold extension of the method to any metric is straightforward. We test our methodology with some well-established metrics and find that none of them show human-like invisibility thresholds.
  This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds. The data and code are publicly available to test other metrics.</description>

      <title>Img2CAD: Reverse Engineering 3D CAD Models from Images through VLM-Assisted Conditional Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverse engineering 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from images is an important task for many downstream applications including interactive editing, manufacturing, architecture, robotics, etc. The difficulty of the task lies in vast representational disparities between the CAD output and the image input. CAD models are precise, programmatic constructs that involve sequential operations combining discrete command structure with continuous attributes, making it challenging to learn and optimize in an end-to-end fashion. Concurrently, input images introduce inherent challenges such as photometric variability and sensor noise, complicating the reverse engineering process. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that conditionally factorizes the task into two sub-problems. First, we leverage vision-language foundation models (VLMs), a finetuned Llama3.2, to predict the global discrete base structure with semantic information. Second, we propose TrAssembler that, conditioned on the discrete structure with semantics, predicts the continuous attribute values. To support the training of our TrAssembler, we further constructed an annotated CAD dataset of common objects from ShapeNet. Putting all together, our approach and data demonstrate significant first steps towards CAD-ifying images in the wild. Code and data can be found in https://github.com/qq456cvb/Img2CAD.</description>

However, current methods heavily depend on user-specific calibration, which limits their scalability and usability. We introduce FOVAL, a robust calibration-free approach that combines spatiotemporal sequence modelling via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with subject-invariant feature engineering and normalisation. Compared to Transformers, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), and CNNs, FOVAL achieves superior performance, particularly in scenarios with limited and noisy gaze data. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and cross-dataset validation show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.1 cm and strong generalisation without calibration. We further analyse inter-subject variability and domain shifts, providing insight into model robustness and adaptation. FOVAL's scalability and accuracy make it highly suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Combo, for harmonious co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaption. In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which not only poses challenge on learning capacity but also hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

      <title>CrackSCF: Lightweight Cascaded Fusion Network for Robust and Efficient Structural Crack Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately segmenting structural cracks at the pixel level remains a major hurdle, as existing methods fail to integrate local textures with pixel dependencies, often leading to fragmented and incomplete predictions. Moreover, their high parameter counts and substantial computational demands hinder practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose CrackSCF, a Lightweight Cascaded Fusion Crack Segmentation Network designed to achieve robust crack segmentation with exceptional computational efficiency. We design a lightweight convolutional block (LRDS) to replace all standard convolutions. This approach efficiently captures local patterns while operating with a minimal computational footprint. For a holistic perception of crack structures, a lightweight Long-range Dependency Extractor (LDE) captures global dependencies. These are then intelligently unified with local patterns by our Staircase Cascaded Fusion Module (SCFM), ensuring the final segmentation maps are both seamless in continuity and rich in fine-grained detail. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we created the challenging TUT benchmark dataset and evaluated it alongside five other public datasets. The experimental results show that the CrackSCF method consistently outperforms the existing methods, and it demonstrates greater robustness in dealing with complex background noise. On the TUT dataset, CrackSCF achieved 0.8382 on F1 score and 0.8473 on mIoU, and it only required 4.79M parameters.</description>

      <title>DAOcc: 3D Object Detection Assisted Multi-Sensor Fusion for 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. However, most existing approaches depend on high-resolution images and complex networks to achieve top performance, hindering their deployment in practical scenarios. Moreover, current multi-sensor fusion approaches mainly focus on improving feature fusion while largely neglecting effective supervision strategies for those features. To address these issues, we propose DAOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that leverages 3D object detection supervision to assist in achieving superior performance, while using a deployment-friendly image backbone and practical input resolution. In addition, we introduce a BEV View Range Extension strategy to mitigate performance degradation caused by lower image resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAOcc achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin using only a ResNet-50 backbone and 256*704 input resolution. With TensorRT optimization, DAOcc reaches 104.9 FPS while maintaining 54.2 mIoU on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/AlphaPlusTT/DAOcc.</description>

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.</description>

      <title>G2D2: Gradient-Guided Discrete Diffusion for Inverse Problem Solving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent literature has effectively leveraged diffusion models trained on continuous variables as priors for solving inverse problems. Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging generative models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques with a lower GPU memory consumption. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/g2d2.</description>

      <title>MolParser: End-to-end Visual Recognition of Molecule Structures in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>CADSpotting: Robust Panoptic Symbol Spotting on Large-Scale CAD Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CADSpotting, an effective method for panoptic symbol spotting in large-scale architectural CAD drawings. Existing approaches often struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs, and typically rely on additional features (e.g., primitive types or graphical layers) to improve performance. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with only coordinate attributes, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique that combines weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale dataset comprising 45 finely annotated floorplans, each covering approximately 1,000 $m^2$, significantly larger than prior benchmarks. LS-CAD will be publicly released to support future research. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD demonstrate that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also showcase its practical value by enabling automated parametric 3D interior reconstruction directly from raw CAD inputs.</description>

      <title>NFL-BA: Near-Field Light Bundle Adjustment for SLAM in Dynamic Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems typically assume static, distant illumination; however, many real-world scenarios, such as endoscopy, subterranean robotics, and search &amp; rescue in collapsed environments, require agents to operate with a co-located light and camera in the absence of external lighting. In such cases, dynamic near-field lighting introduces strong, view-dependent shading that significantly degrades SLAM performance. We introduce Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss (NFL-BA) which explicitly models near-field lighting as a part of Bundle Adjustment loss and enables better performance for scenes captured with dynamic lighting. NFL-BA can be integrated into neural rendering-based SLAM systems with implicit or explicit scene representations. Our evaluations mainly focus on endoscopy procedure where SLAM can enable autonomous navigation, guidance to unsurveyed regions, blindspot detections, and 3D visualizations, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and endoscopy experience for both physicians and patients. Replacing Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss of SLAM systems with NFL-BA leads to significant improvement in camera tracking, 37% for MonoGS and 14% for EndoGS, and leads to state-of-the-art camera tracking and mapping performance on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset. Further evaluation on indoor scenes captured with phone camera with flashlight turned on, also demonstrate significant improvement in SLAM performance due to NFL-BA.

      <title>iCBIR-Sli: Interpretable Content-Based Image Retrieval with 2D Slice Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Affective Computing Models in Video Interviews with Spanish-speaking Older Adults</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding emotional signals in older adults is crucial for designing virtual assistants that support their well-being. However, existing affective computing models often face significant limitations: (1) limited availability of datasets representing older adults, especially in non-English-speaking populations, and (2) poor generalization of models trained on younger or homogeneous demographics. To address these gaps, this study evaluates state-of-the-art affective computing models -- including facial expression recognition, text sentiment analysis, and smile detection -- using videos of older adults interacting with either a person or a virtual avatar. As part of this effort, we introduce a novel dataset featuring Spanish-speaking older adults engaged in human-to-human video interviews. Through three comprehensive analyses, we investigate (1) the alignment between human-annotated labels and automatic model outputs, (2) the relationships between model outputs across different modalities, and (3) individual variations in emotional signals. Using both the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) dataset and our newly collected dataset, we uncover limited agreement between human annotations and model predictions, weak consistency across modalities, and significant variability among individuals. These findings highlight the shortcomings of generalized emotion perception models and emphasize the need of incorporating personal variability and cultural nuances into future systems.</description>

      <title>Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.</description>

      <title>Screener: Self-supervised Pathology Segmentation in Medical CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate detection of all pathological findings in 3D medical images remains a significant challenge, as supervised models are limited to detecting only the few pathology classes annotated in existing datasets. To address this, we frame pathology detection as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pretraining, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our fully self-supervised model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Furthermore, in a supervised fine-tuning setting, Screener surpasses existing self-supervised pretraining methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art foundation for pathology segmentation. The code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme heat events, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant challenges to urban resilience and planning. This study introduces a climate-responsive digital twin framework integrating the Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (ST-ViT) model to enhance heat stress forecasting and decision-making. Using a Texas campus as a testbed, we synthesized high-resolution physical model simulations with spatial and meteorological data to develop fine-scale human thermal predictions. The ST-ViT-powered digital twin enables efficient, data-driven insights for planners and stakeholders, supporting targeted heat mitigation strategies and advancing climate-adaptive urban design. This campus-scale demonstration offers a foundation for future applications across broader and more diverse urban contexts.</description>

      <title>SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</description>

      <title>Quality-Driven Curation of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Data via Learned Scoring Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in interpreting remote sensing (RS) images through language-guided semantic. However, the effectiveness of these VLMs critically depends on high-quality image-text training data that captures rich semantic relationships between visual content and language descriptions. Unlike natural images, RS lacks large-scale interleaved image-text pairs from web data, making data collection challenging. While current approaches rely primarily on rule-based methods or flagship VLMs for data synthesis, a systematic framework for automated quality assessment of such synthetically generated RS vision-language data is notably absent. To fill this gap, we propose a novel score model trained on large-scale RS vision-language preference data for automated quality assessment. Our empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuning CLIP or advanced VLMs (e.g., Qwen2-VL) with the top 30% of data ranked by our score model achieves superior accuracy compared to both full-data fine-tuning and CLIP-score-based ranking approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications of our scoring model for reinforcement learning (RL) training and best-of-N (BoN) test-time scaling, enabling significant improvements in VLM performance for RS tasks. Our code, model, and dataset are publicly available</description>

      <title>ISP-AD: A Large-Scale Real-World Dataset for Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection with Synthetic and Real Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic visual inspection using machine learning plays a key role in achieving zero-defect policies in industry. Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundation models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks, yet little is known about its inner workings. As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.</description>

      <title>Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking in Rule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16188v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of explicit thinking process in rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for MLLMs. We first propose CLS-RL for MLLM image classification, using verifiable rewards for fine-tuning. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.</description>

      <title>Training A Neural Network For Partially Occluded Road Sign Identification In The Context Of Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>scSplit: Bringing Severity Cognizance to Image Decomposition in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</description>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech processing. However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. In this research, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques has been proposed, i.e. AttentionDrop with its three different variants, which operate directly on the self-attention distributions. Hard Attention Masking randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization, Blurred Attention Smoothing applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions, and Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss. Results achieved in the study demonstrate that AttentionDrop consistently improves accuracy, calibration, and adversarial robustness over standard Dropout, DropConnect, and R-Drop baselines</description>

      <title>DSDNet: Raw Domain Demoir\'eing via Dual Color-Space Synergy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile imaging, capturing screens using smartphones has become a prevalent practice in distance learning and conference recording. However, moir\'e artifacts, caused by frequency aliasing between display screens and camera sensors, are further amplified by the image signal processing pipeline, leading to severe visual degradation. Existing sRGB domain demoir\'eing methods struggle with irreversible information loss, while recent two-stage raw domain approaches suffer from information bottlenecks and inference inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage raw domain demoir\'eing framework, Dual-Stream Demoir\'eing Network (DSDNet), which leverages the synergy of raw and YCbCr images to remove moir\'e while preserving luminance and color fidelity. Specifically, to guide luminance correction and moir\'e removal, we design a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline and introduce the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module. This module enriches the raw-to-sRGB conversion with cross-domain contextual features. Furthermore, to better guide color fidelity, we develop a Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT), which decouples luminance and chrominance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation and achieves an inference speed $\mathrm{\textbf{2.4x}}$ faster than the second-best method, highlighting its practical advantages. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxxxdsdnet.github.io/DSDNet/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly transforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Driven Robust Disease Detection in Brain and Gastrointestinal Disorders via Context-Aware Adaptive Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical disease prediction, particularly through imaging, remains a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of medical data, including noise, ambiguity, and differing image quality. Recent deep learning models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions. Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer. Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset. This enhanced performance is further evidenced by the improved results, surpassing existing benchmarks of 97.24% (Kaggle), 91.43% (Figshare), and 95.00% (GastroNet).</description>

Abstract: The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models. For our TT-DF dataset, please refer to https://github.com/HashTAG00002/TT-DF.</description>

      <title>Examining Deployment and Refinement of the VIOLA-AI Intracranial Hemorrhage Model Using an Interactive NeoMedSys Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.
  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A prospective pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.</description>

      <title>Semantic Change Detection of Roads and Bridges: A Fine-grained Dataset and Multimodal Frequency-driven Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate detection of road and bridge changes is crucial for urban planning and transportation management, yet presents unique challenges for general change detection (CD). Key difficulties arise from maintaining the continuity of roads and bridges as linear structures and disambiguating visually similar land covers (e.g., road construction vs. bare land). Existing spatial-domain models struggle with these issues, further hindered by the lack of specialized, semantically rich datasets. To fill these gaps, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset. As the first benchmark to systematically target semantic change detection of roads and bridges, RB-SCD offers comprehensive fine-grained annotations for 11 semantic change categories. This enables a detailed analysis of traffic infrastructure evolution. Building on this, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). MFDCD integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain through two key components: (1) the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC), which leverages wavelet transform to decompose visual features, enabling it to robustly model the continuity of linear transitions; and (2) the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF), which encodes semantic priors into frequency-domain graphs and applies filter banks to align them with visual features, resolving semantic ambiguities. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MFDCD on RB-SCD and three public CD datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/DaGuangDaGuang/RB-SCD.</description>

      <title>RETRO: REthinking Tactile Representation Learning with Material PriOrs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.</description>

      <title>GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.</description>

      <title>cadrille: Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction with Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.</description>

      <title>OSPO: Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled models to perform both understanding and generation of multimodal data in a unified manner. However, achieving a fine-grained alignment between input prompts and generated images remains a major challenge especially in text-to-image generation. Therefore, recent works have introduced self-improving mechanisms based on self-generated data and self-feedback to efficiently mitigate this challenge without relying on external large-scale data or models. However, existing self-improving approaches have not focused on fine-grained visual details especially at the object level in generating training data or providing a feedback, and thus they still struggle to resolve the object hallucination problem in text-to-image generation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO), a self-improving framework for enhancing object-level text-image alignment. OSPO is designed to explicitly address the need for constructing and leveraging object-level hard negative data and an object-centric optimization in improving object-specific fidelity. In specific, OSPO consists of: (1) Initial Prompt Generation (2) Hard Preference Pair Generation (3) Filtering and Selection (4) Object-centric Preference Optimization with Conditional Preference Loss. Extensive experiments on compositional image generation benchmarks demonstrate that OSPO significantly improves fine-grained alignment in text-to-image generation, surpassing not only prior self-improving methods but also diffusion-based specialized image generation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>LLMs Can Compensate for Deficiencies in Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.</description>

      <title>OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</description>

      <title>DualEdit: Dual Editing for Knowledge Updating in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

      <title>Classification of Tents in Street Bazaars Using CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.</description>

      <title>RePIC: Reinforced Post-Training for Personalizing Multi-Modal Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.</description>

      <title>ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</description>

However, the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution, the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection.</description>

      <title>MCGA: Mixture of Codebooks Hyperspectral Reconstruction via Grayscale-Aware Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB inputs provides a cost-effective alternative to hyperspectral cameras, but reconstructing high-dimensional spectra from three channels is inherently ill-posed. Existing methods typically directly regress RGB-to-HSI mappings using large attention networks, which are computationally expensive and handle ill-posedness only implicitly. We propose MCGA, a Mixture-of-Codebooks with Grayscale-aware Attention framework that explicitly addresses these challenges using spectral priors and photometric consistency. MCGA first learns transferable spectral priors via a mixture-of-codebooks (MoC) from heterogeneous HSI datasets, then aligns RGB features with these priors through grayscale-aware photometric attention (GANet). Efficiency and robustness are further improved via top-K attention design and test-time adaptation (TTA). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, strong cross-dataset generalization, and 4-5x faster inference. Codes will be available once acceptance at https://github.com/Fibonaccirabbit/MCGA.</description>

      <title>Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>VLA-Mark: A cross modal watermark for large vision-language alignment model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</description>

      <title>CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse. We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75 datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more stable performance across diverse shifts.</description>

      <title>SAR-TEXT: A Large-Scale SAR Image-Text Dataset Built with SAR-Narrator and Progressive Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.</description>

      <title>RegionMed-CLIP: A Region-Aware Multimodal Contrastive Learning Pre-trained Model for Medical Image Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</description>

      <title>GPSToken: Gaussian Parameterized Spatially-adaptive Tokenization for Image Representation and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at $\href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}$.</description>

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

      <title>USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration, ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding (SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy.

      <description>arXiv:2509.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the "purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Its effectiveness is driven by three core innovations. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.</description>

      <title>AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 40.2% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.28 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D.. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</description>

      <title>SPATIALGEN: Layout-guided 3D Indoor Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.</description>

      <title>Sea-ing Through Scattered Rays: Revisiting the Image Formation Model for Realistic Underwater Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82.5% by survey participants. Data and code can be accessed on the project page: vap.aau.dk/sea-ing-through-scattered-rays.</description>

      <title>RGB-Only Supervised Camera Parameter Optimization in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes. Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video, dubbed ROS-Cam. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.</description>

      <title>ScaleCUA: Scaling Open-Source Computer Use Agents with Cross-Platform Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models. In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains, built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts. Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.</description>

      <title>Domain-invariant feature learning in brain MR imaging for content-based image retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning. In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</description>

      <title>Revealing Human Internal Attention Patterns from Gameplay Analysis for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for revealing human internal attention patterns from gameplay data alone, leveraging offline attention techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). We propose contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention networks, which generate attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. To evaluate whether the human CTR maps reveal internal attention, we validate our model by quantitative and qualitative comparison to the agent maps as well as to a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on human eye-tracking data. Our results show that human CTR maps are more sparse than the agent ones and align better with the TIOA maps. Following a qualitative visual comparison we conclude that they likely capture patterns of internal attention. As a further application, we use these maps to guide RL agents, finding that human internal attention-guided agents achieve slightly improved and more stable learning compared to baselines. This work advances the understanding of human-agent attention differences and provides a new approach for extracting and validating internal attention from behavioral data.</description>

      <title>Set Phasers to Stun: Beaming Power and Control to Mobile Robots with Laser Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Phaser, a flexible system that directs narrow-beam laser light to moving robots for concurrent wireless power delivery and communication. We design a semi-automatic calibration procedure to enable fusion of stereo-vision-based 3D robot tracking with high-power beam steering, and a low-power optical communication scheme that reuses the laser light as a data channel. We fabricate a Phaser prototype using off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance with battery-free autonomous robots. Phaser delivers optical power densities of over 110 mW/cm$^2$ and error-free data to mobile robots at multi-meter ranges, with on-board decoding drawing 0.3 mA ($97\%$ less current than Bluetooth Low Energy). We demonstrate Phaser fully powering gram-scale battery-free robots to nearly 2x higher speeds than prior work while simultaneously controlling them to navigate around obstacles and along paths. Code, an open-source design guide, and a demonstration video of Phaser is available at https://mobilex.cs.columbia.edu/phaser.</description>

      <title>HistDiST: Histopathological Diffusion-based Stain Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&amp;E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&amp;E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&amp;E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&amp;E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</description>

      <title>Are Vision-Language Models Safe in the Wild? A Meme-Based Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms. MemeSafetyBench is publicly available at https://github.com/oneonlee/Meme-Safety-Bench.</description>

      <title>Efficient RAW Image Deblurring with Adaptive Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions, thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally, frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .</description>

      <title>Perception-R1: Advancing Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities of MLLMs via Visual Perception Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Learning for Generalizable Surgical Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Holographic Reconstruction via Amplitude-Only Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</description>
