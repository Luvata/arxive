      <title>Large Language Models for Real-World IoT Device Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments, where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated. We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields, protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests, demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable foundation for real-world device identification at scale.</description>

      <title>Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios.

      <title>Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

      <title>CoLoR-GAN: Continual Few-Shot Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation in Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required. Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient, reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

      <title>Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.</description>

      <title>K-frames: Scene-Driven Any-k Keyframe Selection for long video understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations. Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be available.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Semi-Supervised Label Distribution Learning with Local Structure Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered. In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views. Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this $k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL. Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.</description>

      <title>Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters $\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually. Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data (data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9 percentage points in a data-free setting.</description>

      <title>LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660.</description>

      <title>Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal (regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity). Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements, often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses, and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into 1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

      <title>REAP the Experts: Why Pruning Prevails for One-Shot MoE compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression. Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms. Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.</description>

      <title>Conditional Clifford-Steerable CNNs with Complete Kernel Basis for PDE Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Noise-Adaptive Layerwise Learning Rates: Accelerating Geometry-Aware Optimization for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.</description>

      <title>Context-Selective State Space Models: Feedback is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE (COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only 3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.</description>

      <title>CausalVerse: Benchmarking Causal Representation Learning with Configurable High-Fidelity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels, temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.

      <title>FedHFT: Efficient Federated Finetuning with Heterogeneous Edge Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying computation resources available across participating clients such as edge devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.</description>

      <title>On the expressivity of sparse maxout networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.</description>

      <title>Neural Network approximation power on homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs, providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Transformers via Recursive Latent Space Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii) algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively, these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust OOD generalization abilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience, finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret-Queue Length Tradeoff in Online Learning for Two-Sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret, $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$ maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast learning and maintaining small queue lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently, they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a \emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution. We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling from these twisted distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that integrates data-driven domain as a constraint into the nonlinear programming technique, addressing the overlooked issue of domain-inconsistent solutions arising from the interaction of parametrised neural network models with optimisation solvers. Applied to a 1180 MW capacity combined cycle gas power plant, our framework delivers domain-consistent robust optimal solutions that achieve a verified 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency. For the first time, scaling this efficiency gain to the global fleet of gas power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with 10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term, scalable decarbonisation pathways for global climate action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.</description>

      <title>Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable, per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible, and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of theoretical optima.</description>

      <title>Inferred global dense residue transition graphs from primary structure sequences enable protein interaction prediction via directed graph convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development. Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</description>

      <title>On Evaluating Loss Functions for Stock Ranking: An Empirical Analysis With Transformer Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&amp;P 500 data. We focus on assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Data Understanding Survey: Pursuing Improved Dataset Characterization Via Tensor-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving domains of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, existing dataset characterization methods such as statistical, structural, and model-based analyses often fail to deliver the deep understanding and insights essential for innovation and explainability. This work surveys the current state-of-the-art conventional data analytic techniques and examines their limitations, and discusses a variety of tensor-based methods and how these may provide a more robust alternative to traditional statistical, structural, and model-based dataset characterization techniques. Through examples, we illustrate how tensor methods unveil nuanced data characteristics, offering enhanced interpretability and actionable intelligence. We advocate for the adoption of tensor-based characterization, promising a leap forward in understanding complex datasets and paving the way for intelligent, explainable data-driven discoveries.</description>

      <title>Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer: From Backpropagation to Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>MAFA: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enterprise-Scale Annotation with Configurable Task Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10% medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1 in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations facing similar annotation challenges.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Diffusion Alignment: Learning Structured Latents for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However, practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Molecular Kernels: When Richer Features Do Not Guarantee Better Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>When Flatness Does (Not) Guarantee Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small, adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima, regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness. While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete. By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in robustness.</description>

      <title>Scaling Test-Time Compute to Achieve IOI Gold Medal with Open-Weight Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present \gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Policy Regularized Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ. We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics. Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret. To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally, empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate the robustness of DR-RPO.</description>

      <title>A Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network for Motion Prediction of Elastic Bragg Breakwaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments. However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network (PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in ocean engineering.</description>

      <title>Generalist vs Specialist Time Series Foundation Models: Investigating Potential Emergent Behaviors in Assessing Human Health Using PPG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</description>

      <title>CAST: Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking for Understanding Transformer Layer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives. Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.</description>

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

      <title>Stable Prediction of Adverse Events in Medical Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new, relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms, and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

      <title>Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>TED++: Submanifold-Aware Backdoor Detection via Layerwise Tubular-Neighbourhood Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++, a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness'' from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking (LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to 14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.</description>

      <title>Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state. The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.</description>

      <title>LLM-ERM: Sample-Efficient Program Learning via LLM-Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a ``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs. {\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.</description>

      <title>DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter. Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Stop-RAG: Value-Based Retrieval Control for Iterative RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Jet Functors and Weil Algebras in Automatic Differentiation: A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback, while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and scientific computing. Code and examples are available at https://git.nilu.no/geometric-ad/jet-weil-ad.</description>

      <title>Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>SHaRe-SSM: An Oscillatory Spiking Neural Network for Target Variable Modeling in Long Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning. Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences, thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling (including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences. Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$ less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.</description>

      <title>Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced according to the capabilities of each modality.</description>

      <title>Interaction Concordance Index: Performance Evaluation for Interaction Prediction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper, we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions. Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.</description>

      <title>MergeMoE: Efficient Compression of MoE Models via Expert Output Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the baselines with the same compression ratios.</description>

      <title>A Free Lunch in LLM Compression: Revisiting Retraining after Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs. Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work, we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 1: training on fluvial deposits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of promise.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection and Regularization in Multi-Class Classification: An Empirical Study of One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent Optimization and L1 Sparsity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides 24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1 regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Coder as Editor: Code-driven Interpretable Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Holdout-Loss-Based Data Selection for LLM Finetuning via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates, highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.</description>

      <title>From Guess2Graph: When and How Can Unreliable Experts Safely Boost Causal Discovery in Finite Samples?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use. We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random." Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.</description>

      <title>Learning to Undo: Rollback-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Reversibility Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8 percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9 percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable sequential decision making.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models.

      <title>On the Identifiability of Tensor Ranks via Prior Predictive Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system, rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models, we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness of the proposal.</description>

      <title>Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.</description>

      <title>MX+: Pushing the Limits of Microscaling Formats for Efficient Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats. MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6 for efficient LLM inference.</description>

      <title>Redundancy-Aware Test-Time Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically, our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless. We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance competitive to the original TabPFN model.</description>

      <title>Selective Labeling with False Discovery Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder. However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.</description>

      <title>Matcha: Multi-Stage Riemannian Flow Matching for Accurate and Physically Valid Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces ($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding models.

      <title>Multimodal RAG for Unstructured Data:Leveraging Modality-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Hybrid Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</description>

      <title>First Attentions Last: Better Exploiting First Attentions for Efficient Transformer Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP), where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication. Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations, we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers, eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to 44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity without increasing the training time than the baseline.</description>

      <title>LeapFactual: Reliable Visual Counterfactual Explanation Using Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification with Counterfactual Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Moment Alignment for Domain Adaptation via Siegel Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.</description>

      <title>Online Reliable Anomaly Detection via Neuromorphic Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.</description>

      <title>FedPPA: Progressive Parameter Alignment for Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however, clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior performance in personalized adaptation.</description>

      <title>Seesaw: Accelerating Training by Balancing Learning Rate and Batch Size Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate, the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps. Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the theoretical limit implied by our analysis.</description>

      <title>Tawa: Automatic Warp Specialization for Modern GPUs with Asynchronous References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance, asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program. Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references (aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains 1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming effort.</description>

      <title>The Pursuit of Diversity: Multi-Objective Testing of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively, while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.</description>

      <title>Beyond Multi-Token Prediction: Pretraining LLMs with Future Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models (LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training. Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP), which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left. Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders (LvLiNGAM). Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot properly handle models with causal relationships among observed variables.
  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM, allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables, and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under different environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Hebbian Principle: Low-Dimensional Structural Projection for Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks, demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic Structured Sparse Training with Learned Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$ and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tackling Time-Series Forecasting Generalization via Mitigating Concept Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting, designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.</description>

      <title>Programmatic Representation Learning with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3 algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and understood.</description>

      <title>To Infinity and Beyond: Tool-Use Unlocks Length Generalization in State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form'' generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks. These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Dynamic Handover via AI-assisted Signal Quality Prediction in 6G Multi-RAT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT) networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist, requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics, interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller, which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out. Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings, showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.</description>

      <title>Provable Unlearning with Gradient Ascent on Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models, addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch. Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful} unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic Gaussian-mixture setting.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Unlearning by Linear Task Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety. Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks. This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space, finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement. Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present state-of-the-art defenses.</description>

      <title>Predicting kernel regression learning curves from only raw data statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning algorithms on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning When Not to Learn: Risk-Sensitive Abstention in Bandits with Unbounded Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit (execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d. inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely in high-stakes environments.</description>

      <title>Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</description>

      <title>Circuit Insights: Towards Interpretability Beyond Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify. Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence. Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently, our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models.</description>

      <title>Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At 33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response domains.</description>

      <title>Biology-informed neural networks learn nonlinear representations from omics data to improve genomic prediction and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together, BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection, pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.</description>

      <title>pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Lens: Using Explainable AI to Understand Human Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for quantitatively studying human cognition.</description>

      <title>GQVis: A Dataset of Genomics Data Questions and Visualizations for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data visualization is a fundamental tool in genomics research, enabling the exploration, interpretation, and communication of complex genomic features. While machine learning models show promise for transforming data into insightful visualizations, current models lack the training foundation for domain-specific tasks. In an effort to provide a foundational resource for genomics-focused model training, we present a framework for generating a dataset that pairs abstract, low-level questions about genomics data with corresponding visualizations. Building on prior work with statistical plots, our approach adapts to the complexity of genomics data and the specialized representations used to depict them. We further incorporate multiple linked queries and visualizations, along with justifications for design choices, figure captions, and image alt-texts for each item in the dataset. We use genomics data retrieved from three distinct genomics data repositories (4DN, ENCODE, Chromoscope) to produce GQVis: a dataset consisting of 1.14 million single-query data points, 628k query pairs, and 589k query chains. The GQVis dataset and generation code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/HIDIVE/GQVis and https://github.com/hms-dbmi/GQVis-Generation.</description>

      <title>Joint Active RIS Configuration and User Power Control for Localization: A Neuroevolution-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies user localization aided by a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). A feedback link from the Base Station (BS) to the user is adopted to enable dynamic power control of the user pilot transmissions in the uplink. A novel multi-agent algorithm for the joint control of the RIS phase configuration and the user transmit power is presented, which is based on a hybrid approach integrating NeuroEvolution (NE) and supervised learning. The proposed scheme requires only single-bit feedback messages for the uplink power control, supports RIS elements with discrete responses, and is numerically shown to outperform fingerprinting, deep reinforcement learning baselines and backpropagation-based position estimators.</description>

      <title>Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks. However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably, gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads. However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution. Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning Approaches for Classifying Autism from Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is most often diagnosed using behavioral evaluations, which can vary between clinicians. Brain imaging, combined with machine learning, may help identify more objective patterns linked to ASD. This project used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the publicly available ABIDE I dataset (n = 1,112) to test two approaches for classifying ASD and control participants. The first was a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) trained end-to-end. The second was a hybrid approach that used the CNN as a feature extractor and then applied a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The baseline CNN reached moderate performance (accuracy = 0.66, AUC = 0.70), while the hybrid CNN + SVM achieved higher overall accuracy (0.76) and AUC (0.80). The hybrid model also produced more balanced results between ASD and control groups. Separating feature extraction and classification improved performance and reduced bias between diagnostic groups. These findings suggest that combining deep learning and traditional machine learning methods could enhance the reliability of MRI-based research on ASD.</description>

      <title>DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially. While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency. Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.</description>

      <title>On-device System of Compositional Multi-tasking in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately, standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Language steering in latent space to mitigate unintended code-switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration. Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to 42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear separability.</description>

      <title>EvoEdit: Evolving Null-space Alignment for Robust and Efficient Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference. Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>R2T: Rule-Encoded Loss Functions for Low-Resource Sequence Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function, which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy, outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER), R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.</description>

      <title>FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.</description>

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a martingale representation, we introduce a novel deep-learning approach, which we call DeepMartingale, to study the duality of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems in continuous time. This approach provides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in high-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from DeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we establish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value function within any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ under our architectural design of neural networks whose size is bounded by $\tilde{c}\,D^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, where the constants $\tilde{c}, \tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the accuracy $\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the practical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence, expressivity, and stability.</description>

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.</description>

Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model.
  The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.</description>

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved video browsing.</description>

      <title>Benefits and Limitations of Communication in Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly, (ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory. Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable multi-agent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Switchboard-Affect: Emotion Perception Labels from Conversational Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nuances of speech emotion dataset curation and labeling is essential for assessing speech emotion recognition (SER) model potential in real-world applications. Most training and evaluation datasets contain acted or pseudo-acted speech (e.g., podcast speech) in which emotion expressions may be exaggerated or otherwise intentionally modified. Furthermore, datasets labeled based on crowd perception often lack transparency regarding the guidelines given to annotators. These factors make it difficult to understand model performance and pinpoint necessary areas for improvement. To address this gap, we identified the Switchboard corpus as a promising source of naturalistic conversational speech, and we trained a crowd to label the dataset for categorical emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, happiness, tenderness, calmness, and neutral) and dimensional attributes (activation, valence, and dominance). We refer to this label set as Switchboard-Affect (SWB-Affect). In this work, we present our approach in detail, including the definitions provided to annotators and an analysis of the lexical and paralinguistic cues that may have played a role in their perception. In addition, we evaluate state-of-the-art SER models, and we find variable performance across the emotion categories with especially poor generalization for anger. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation with datasets that capture natural affective variations in speech. We release the labels for SWB-Affect to enable further analysis in this domain.</description>

      <title>Readability $\ne$ Learnability: Rethinking the Role of Simplicity in Training Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs. Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training -- drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support capability emergence in small models.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Monthly Rainfall in West Bengal Using Ensemble Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rainfall forecasting plays a critical role in climate adaptation, agriculture, and water resource management. This study develops long-term forecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a century-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated into monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district. The forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years, 2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall dynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines regression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals, quarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first forecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and neighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary inputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term spatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture, irrigation planning, and water conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Classifying and Addressing the Diversity of Errors in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.</description>

      <title>Signature in Code Backdoor Detection, how far are we?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data. Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks, recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the defense.</description>

      <title>Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.</description>

      <title>PIShield: Detecting Prompt Injection Attacks via Intrinsic LLM Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-integrated applications are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker contaminates the input to inject malicious prompts, causing the LLM to follow the attacker's intent instead of the original user's. Existing prompt injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method that is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal representation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer of the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing features between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we train a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a labeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11 baselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks. The results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we show that PIShield resists strong adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Think Globally, Group Locally: Evaluating LLMs Using Multi-Lingual Word Grouping Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success, such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task, and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a variety of high- dimensional optimization problems trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with data generated from multiple anisotropic classes. We give exact expressions for a large class of functions of the limiting dynamics, including the risk and the overlap with the true signal, in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We extend the existing theory of high-dimensional SGD dynamics to Gaussian-mixture data and a large (growing with the parameter size) number of classes. We then investigate in detail the effect of the anisotropic structure of the covariance of the data in the problems of binary logistic regression and least square loss. We study three cases: isotropic covariances, data covariance matrices with a large fraction of zero eigenvalues (denoted as the zero-one model), and covariance matrices with spectra following a power-law distribution. We show that there exists a structural phase transition. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the zero-one model and the power-law model with sufficiently large power, SGD tends to align more closely with values of the class mean that are projected onto the "clean directions" (i.e., directions of smaller variance). This is supported by both numerical simulations and analytical studies, which show the exact asymptotic behavior of the loss in the high-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>deFOREST: Fusing Optical and Radar satellite data for Enhanced Sensing of Tree-loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a deforestation detection pipeline that incorporates optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. A crucial component of the pipeline is the construction of anomaly maps of the optical data, which is done using the residual space of a discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion. Anomalies are quantified using a concentration bound on the distribution of the residual components for the nominal state of the forest. This bound does not require prior knowledge on the distribution of the data. This is in contrast to statistical parametric methods that assume knowledge of the data distribution, an impractical assumption that is especially infeasible for high dimensional data such as ours. Once the optical anomaly maps are computed they are combined with SAR data, and the state of the forest is classified by using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We test our approach with Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) data on a $92.19\,km \times 91.80\,km$ region in the Amazon forest. The results show that both the hybrid optical-radar and optical only methods achieve high accuracy that is superior to the recent state-of-the-art hybrid method. Moreover, the hybrid method is significantly more robust in the case of sparse optical data that are common in highly cloudy regions.</description>

      <title>Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density ($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover, latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes, suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.</description>

      <title>David vs. Goliath: A comparative study of different-sized LLMs for code generation in the domain of automotive scenario generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional BWDM: A Robust Nonparametric Clustering Validation Index for Large-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the appropriate number of clusters in unsupervised learning is a central problem in statistics and data science. Traditional validity indices such as Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, and Davies-Bouldin-depend on centroid-based distances and therefore degrade in high-dimensional or contaminated data. This paper proposes a new robust, nonparametric clustering validation framework, the High-Dimensional Between-Within Distance Median (HD-BWDM), which extends the recently introduced BWDM criterion to high-dimensional spaces. HD-BWDM integrates random projection and principal component analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and applies trimmed clustering and medoid-based distances to ensure robustness against outliers. We derive theoretical results showing consistency and convergence under Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HD-BWDM remains stable and interpretable under high-dimensional projections and contamination, providing a robust alternative to traditional centroid-based validation criteria. The proposed method provides a theoretically grounded, computationally efficient stopping rule for nonparametric clustering in modern high-dimensional applications.</description>

      <title>PoissonNet: A Local-Global Approach for Learning on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability -- both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples. These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces. Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that learn on surfaces.</description>

      <title>CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Combining Reinforcement Learning and Behavior Trees for NPCs in Video Games with AMD Schola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.</description>

      <title>ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.</description>

      <title>A novel Information-Driven Strategy for Optimal Regression Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Machine Learning (ML), a regression algorithm aims to minimize a loss function based on data. An assessment method in this context seeks to quantify the discrepancy between the optimal response for an input-output system and the estimate produced by a learned predictive model (the student). Evaluating the quality of a learned regressor remains challenging without access to the true data-generating mechanism, as no data-driven assessment method can ensure the achievability of global optimality. This work introduces the Information Teacher, a novel data-driven framework for evaluating regression algorithms with formal performance guarantees to assess global optimality. Our novel approach builds on estimating the Shannon mutual information (MI) between the input variables and the residuals and applies to a broad class of additive noise models. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the Information Teacher is capable of detecting global optimality, which is aligned with the condition of zero estimation error with respect to the -- inaccessible, in practice -- true model, working as a surrogate measure of the ground truth assessment loss and offering a principled alternative to conventional empirical performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Flip-Flop Consistency: Unsupervised Training for Robustness to Prompt Perturbations in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%, improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively, increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations.

      <title>Less is More: Denoising Knowledge Graphs For Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models (LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process, demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff. Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially, current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities, and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.</description>

      <title>Beyond a Single Perspective: Towards a Realistic Evaluation of Website Fingerprinting Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer the websites visited by users, posing a serious threat to anonymous communication systems. Although recent WF techniques achieve over 90% accuracy in controlled experimental settings, most studies remain confined to single scenarios, overlooking the complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents the first systematic and comprehensive evaluation of existing WF attacks under diverse realistic conditions, including defense mechanisms, traffic drift, multi-tab browsing, early-stage detection, open-world settings, and few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that many WF techniques with strong performance in isolated settings degrade significantly when facing other conditions. Since real-world environments often combine multiple challenges, current WF attacks are difficult to apply directly in practice. This study highlights the limitations of WF attacks and introduces a multidimensional evaluation framework, offering critical insights for developing more robust and practical WF attacks.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Humanoid Coordination for Collaborative Object Carrying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Driven Small Language Models Based on Agent and OpenAlex Knowledge Graph: Mining Conceptual Pathways and Discovering Innovation Points in Academic Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy. Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging Face platform.</description>

      <title>Evaluating &amp; Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently, poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior, combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation, and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly, models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average. Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned models.</description>

      <title>A Robust Classification Method using Hybrid Word Embedding for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease</title>

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy = 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.</description>

      <title>A Density-Informed Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Improving Breast Cancer Detection Across All Breast Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both high-resource and resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>PluriHop: Exhaustive, Recall-Sensitive QA over Distractor-Rich Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48 pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score. Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a "check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful alternative to top-k methods.</description>

      <title>BoardVision: Deployment-ready and Robust Motherboard Defect Detection with YOLO+Faster-RCNN Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work, we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble, Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes, highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Beat Detection as Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers) output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects." Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively model musical beats with minimal adaptation.</description>

      <title>Low Power Vision Transformer Accelerator with Hardware-Aware Pruning and Optimized Dataflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current transformer accelerators primarily focus on optimizing self-attention due to its quadratic complexity. However, this focus is less relevant for vision transformers with short token lengths, where the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) tends to be the dominant computational bottleneck. This paper presents a low power Vision Transformer accelerator, optimized through algorithm-hardware co-design. The model complexity is reduced using hardware-friendly dynamic token pruning without introducing complex mechanisms. Sparsity is further improved by replacing GELU with ReLU activations and employing dynamic FFN2 pruning, achieving a 61.5\% reduction in operations and a 59.3\% reduction in FFN2 weights, with an accuracy loss of less than 2\%. The hardware adopts a row-wise dataflow with output-oriented data access to eliminate data transposition, and supports dynamic operations with minimal area overhead. Implemented in TSMC's 28nm CMOS technology, our design occupies 496.4K gates and includes a 232KB SRAM buffer, achieving a peak throughput of 1024 GOPS at 1GHz, with an energy efficiency of 2.31 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 858.61 GOPS/mm2.</description>

      <title>Personalized federated learning, Row-wise fusion regularization, Multivariate modeling, Sparse estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study personalized federated learning for multivariate responses where client models are heterogeneous yet share variable-level structure. Existing entry-wise penalties ignore cross-response dependence, while matrix-wise fusion over-couples clients. We propose a Sparse Row-wise Fusion (SROF) regularizer that clusters row vectors across clients and induces within-row sparsity, and we develop RowFed, a communication-efficient federated algorithm that embeds SROF into a linearized ADMM framework with privacy-preserving partial participation. Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for SROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic normality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under random client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves with participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous regimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error and strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a personalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates these gains while preserving interpretability. Together, our results position row-wise fusion as an effective and transparent paradigm for large-scale personalized federated multivariate learning, bridging the gap between entry-wise and matrix-wise formulations.</description>

      <title>State Your Intention to Steer Your Attention: An AI Assistant for Intentional Digital Living</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention, assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22 participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning their digital behavior with their intentions.

      <title>Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection. In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch: during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising. Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training, without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts.</description>

      <title>Symbol Grounding in Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Gentle Introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.</description>

      <title>A Deep State-Space Model Compression Method using Upper Bound on Output Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) that contain linear-quadratic-output (LQO) systems as internal blocks and present a compression method with a provable output error guarantee. We first derive an upper bound on the output error between two Deep SSMs and show that the bound can be expressed via the $h^2$-error norms between the layerwise LQO systems, thereby providing a theoretical justification for existing model order reduction (MOR)-based compression. Building on this bound, we formulate an optimization problem in terms of the $h^2$-error norm and develop a gradient-based MOR method. On the IMDb task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, we demonstrate that our compression method achieves strong performance. Moreover, unlike prior approaches, we reduce roughly 80% of trainable parameters without retraining, with only a 4-5% performance drop.</description>

      <title>Local Causal Discovery for Statistically Efficient Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets, i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents. Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate effect estimation than local methods.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identification for Partial Differential Equation with Jump Discontinuities in Coefficients by Markov Switching Model and Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients are fundamental challenges in modeling complex spatiotemporal systems with heterogeneous structures and uncertain dynamics. Traditional numerical and machine learning approaches often face limitations in addressing these problems due to high dimensionality, inherent nonlinearity, and discontinuous parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that synergistically integrates physics-informed deep learning with Bayesian inference for accurate parameter identification in PDEs with jump discontinuities in coefficients. The core innovation of our framework lies in a dual-network architecture employing a gradient-adaptive weighting strategy: a main network approximates PDE solutions while a sub network samples its coefficients. To effectively identify mixture structures in parameter spaces, we employ Markovian dynamics methods to capture hidden state transitions of complex spatiotemporal systems. The framework has applications in reconstruction of solutions and identification of parameter-varying regions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on various PDEs with jump-varying coefficients demonstrate the framework's exceptional adaptability, accuracy, and robustness compared to existing methods. This study provides a generalizable computational approach of parameter identification for PDEs with discontinuous parameter structures, particularly in non-stationary or heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation Speeds Up Vision Transformers</title>

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.</description>

      <title>When Planners Meet Reality: How Learned, Reactive Traffic Agents Shift nuPlan Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</description>

      <title>MCbiF: Measuring Topological Autocorrelation in Multiscale Clusterings via 2-Parameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datasets often possess an intrinsic multiscale structure with meaningful descriptions at different levels of coarseness. Such datasets are naturally described as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical sequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences, we use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale Clustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales. The MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and reduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely presented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions characterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In particular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement order of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order inconsistencies between clusters across scales. We demonstrate through experiments the use of MCbiF Hilbert functions as topological feature maps for downstream machine learning tasks. MCbiF feature maps outperform information-based baseline features on both regression and classification tasks on synthetic sets of non-hierarchical sequences of partitions. We also show an application of MCbiF to real-world data to measure non-hierarchies in wild mice social grouping patterns across time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Kernel Calibration Conditional Stein Discrepancy test (KCCSD test), a non-parametric, kernel-based test for assessing the calibration of probabilistic models with well-defined scores. In contrast to previous methods, our test avoids the need for possibly expensive expectation approximations while providing control over its type-I error. We achieve these improvements by using a new family of kernels for score-based probabilities that can be estimated without probability density samples, and by using a conditional goodness-of-fit criterion for the KCCSD test's U-statistic. We demonstrate the properties of our test on various synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Code Cohesion Analysis to Identify Source Code Supply Chain Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion (NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707 functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100 of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving source code integrity.</description>

      <title>Agentic NL2SQL to Reduce Computational Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL) has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.</description>

      <title>RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel geometric framework for optimal experimental design (OED). Traditional OED approaches, such as those based on mutual information, rely explicitly on probability densities, leading to restrictive invariance properties. To address these limitations, we propose the mutual transport dependence (MTD), a measure of statistical dependence grounded in optimal transport theory which provides a geometric objective for optimizing designs. Unlike conventional approaches, the MTD can be tailored to specific downstream estimation problems by choosing appropriate geometries on the underlying spaces. We demonstrate that our framework produces high-quality designs while offering a flexible alternative to standard information-theoretic techniques.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Classification, ABCDE Feature Quantification, and Evolution Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A, B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall, this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of skin cancer progression.</description>

      <title>From Loop Nests to Silicon: Mapping AI Workloads onto AMD NPUs with MLIR-AIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures. As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance, compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through compiler-managed scheduling.</description>

Abstract: Algorithms with predictions} has emerged as a powerful framework to combine the robustness of traditional online algorithms with the data-driven performance benefits of machine-learned (ML) predictions. However, most existing approaches in this paradigm are overly conservative, {as they do not leverage problem structure to optimize performance in a prediction-specific manner}. In this paper, we show that such prediction-specific performance criteria can enable significant performance improvements over the coarser notions of consistency and robustness considered in prior work. Specifically, we propose a notion of \emph{strongly-optimal} algorithms with predictions, which obtain Pareto optimality not just in the worst-case tradeoff between robustness and consistency, but also in the prediction-specific tradeoff between these metrics. We develop a general bi-level optimization framework that enables systematically designing strongly-optimal algorithms in a wide variety of problem settings, and we propose explicit strongly-optimal algorithms for several classic online problems: deterministic and randomized ski rental, and one-max search. Our analysis reveals new structural insights into how predictions can be optimally integrated into online algorithms by leveraging a prediction-specific design. To validate the benefits of our proposed framework, we empirically evaluate our algorithms in case studies on problems including dynamic power management and volatility-based index trading. Our results demonstrate that prediction-specific, strongly-optimal algorithms can significantly improve performance across a variety of online decision-making settings.</description>

      <title>Secure Sparse Matrix Multiplications and their Applications to Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To preserve privacy, multi-party computation (MPC) enables executing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on secret-shared or encrypted data. However, existing MPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable for ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or genomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse data, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to prohibitively large memory requirements.
  Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC algorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms avoid the memory issues of the "dense" data representation of classic secure matrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can significantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000) for realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications in which existing protocols are impractical.
  An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can be made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece of information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is small. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there is a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often doesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount of data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows adopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of sparse matrices.</description>

      <title>MaskCaptioner : Learning to Jointly Segment and Caption Object Trajectories in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting, tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language. Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.</description>

      <title>Learnable Mixed Nash Equilibria are Collectively Rational</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability, which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics. Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable, then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover, we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions, individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to collective rationality.</description>

      <title>Budget-aware Test-time Scaling via Discriminative Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a "free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques.

      <title>Predicting Task Performance with Context-aware Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute, and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/wang-research-lab/context-scaling.</description>

      <title>TRI-DEP: A Trimodal Comparative Study for Depression Detection Using Speech, Text, and EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.</description>

      <title>Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models (LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader replication will be reported in a future revision.</description>

      <title>Instruction Set Migration at Warehouse Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Migrating codebases from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another is a major engineering challenge. A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in addition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has seen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on static and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom has been that this is the primary challenge.
  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations can often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to recompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and multifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.
  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning almost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA migration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and demonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these tasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research challenges that warrant further attention.</description>

      <title>VT-Refine: Learning Bimanual Assembly with Visuo-Tactile Feedback via Simulation Fine-Tunin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback -- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

      <title>LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.</description>

      <title>Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</description>

      <title>DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (&lt; 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</description>

      <title>CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</description>

      <title>Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action (VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

      <title>LLMs as Scalable, General-Purpose Simulators For Evolving Digital Agent Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states, a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model, highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.</description>

      <title>TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.</description>

      <title>Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.</description>

      <title>Terra: Explorable Native 3D World Model with Point Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.</description>

      <title>Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</description>

      <title>Agentic Design of Compositional Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Why do explanations fail? A typology and discussion on failures in XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Machine Learning models achieve unprecedented levels of performance, the XAI domain aims at making these models understandable by presenting end-users with intelligible explanations.
  Yet, some existing XAI approaches fail to meet expectations: several issues have been reported in the literature, generally pointing out either
  technical limitations or misinterpretations by users.
  In this paper, we argue that the resulting harms arise from a complex overlap of multiple failures in XAI, which existing ad-hoc studies fail to capture.
  This work therefore advocates for a holistic perspective, presenting a systematic investigation of limitations of current XAI methods and their impact on the interpretation of explanations. %
  By distinguishing between system-specific and user-specific failures,
  we propose a typological framework that helps revealing the nuanced complexities of explanation failures.
  Leveraging this typology, we discuss some research directions to help practitioners better understand the limitations of XAI systems and enhance the quality of ML explanations.</description>

      <title>Lost in the Averages: A New Specific Setup to Evaluate Membership Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data generators and machine learning models can memorize their training data, posing privacy concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a standard method of estimating the privacy risk of these systems. The risk of individual records is typically computed by evaluating MIAs in a record-specific privacy game. We analyze the record-specific privacy game commonly used for evaluating attackers under realistic assumptions (the \textit{traditional} game) -- particularly for synthetic tabular data -- and show that it averages a record's privacy risk across datasets. We show this implicitly assumes the dataset a record is part of has no impact on the record's risk, providing a misleading risk estimate when a specific model or synthetic dataset is released. Instead, we propose a novel use of the leave-one-out game, used in existing work exclusively to audit differential privacy guarantees, and call this the \textit{model-seeded} game. We formalize it and show that it provides an accurate estimate of the privacy risk posed by a given adversary for a record in its specific dataset. We instantiate and evaluate the state-of-the-art MIA for synthetic data generators in the traditional and model-seeded privacy games, and show across multiple datasets and models that the two privacy games indeed result in different risk scores, with up to 94\% of high-risk records being overlooked by the traditional game. We further show that records in smaller datasets and models not protected by strong differential privacy guarantees tend to have a larger gap between risk estimates. Taken together, our results show that the model-seeded setup yields a risk estimate specific to a certain model or synthetic dataset released and in line with the standard notion of privacy leakage from prior work, meaningfully different from the dataset-averaged risk provided by the traditional privacy game.</description>

      <title>Kernel Neural Operators (KNOs) for Scalable, Memory-efficient, Geometrically-flexible Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Kernel Neural Operator (KNO), a provably convergent operator-learning architecture that utilizes compositions of deep kernel-based integral operators for function-space approximation of operators (maps from functions to functions). The KNO decouples the choice of kernel from the numerical integration scheme (quadrature), thereby naturally allowing for operator learning with explicitly-chosen trainable kernels on irregular geometries. On irregular domains, this allows the KNO to utilize domain-specific quadrature rules. To help ameliorate the curse of dimensionality, we also leverage an efficient dimension-wise factorization algorithm on regular domains. More importantly, the ability to explicitly specify kernels also allows the use of highly expressive, non-stationary, neural anisotropic kernels whose parameters are computed by training neural networks. Numerical results demonstrate that on existing benchmarks the training and test accuracy of KNOs is comparable to or higher than popular operator learning techniques while typically using an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, with the more expressive kernels proving important to attaining high accuracy. KNOs thus facilitate low-memory, geometrically-flexible, deep operator learning, while retaining the implementation simplicity and transparency of traditional kernel methods from both scientific computing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</description>

      <title>Say My Name: a Model's Bias Discovery Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years, due to the broad applicability of deep learning to downstream tasks and end-to-end training capabilities, increasingly more concerns about potential biases to specific, non-representative patterns have been raised. Many works focusing on unsupervised debiasing usually leverage the tendency of deep models to learn ``easier'' samples, for example by clustering the latent space to obtain bias pseudo-labels. However, the interpretation of such pseudo-labels is not trivial, especially for a non-expert end user, as it does not provide semantic information about the bias features. To address this issue, we introduce ``Say My Name'' (SaMyNa), the first tool to identify biases within deep models semantically. Unlike existing methods, our approach focuses on biases learned by the model. Our text-based pipeline enhances explainability and supports debiasing efforts: applicable during either training or post-hoc validation, our method can disentangle task-related information and proposes itself as a tool to analyze biases. Evaluation on traditional benchmarks demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting biases and even disclaiming them, showcasing its broad applicability for model diagnosis.</description>

      <title>GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking drug-drug interaction prediction methods: a perspective of distribution changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Emerging drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is crucial for new drugs but is hindered by distribution changes between known and new drugs in real-world scenarios. Current evaluation often neglects these changes, relying on unrealistic i.i.d. split due to the absence of drug approval data. Results: We propose DDI-Ben, a benchmarking framework for emerging DDI prediction under distribution changes. DDI-Ben introduces a distribution change simulation framework that leverages distribution changes between drug sets as a surrogate for real-world distribution changes of DDIs, and is compatible with various drug split strategies. Through extensive benchmarking on ten representative methods, we show that most existing approaches suffer substantial performance degradation under distribution changes. Our analysis further indicates that large language model (LLM) based methods and the integration of drug-related textual information offer promising robustness against such degradation. To support future research, we release the benchmark datasets with simulated distribution changes. Overall, DDI-Ben highlights the importance of explicitly addressing distribution changes and provides a foundation for developing more resilient methods for emerging DDI prediction. Availability and implementation: Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LARS-research/DDI-Bench.</description>

      <title>Disentangled and Self-Explainable Node Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Node representations, or embeddings, are low-dimensional vectors that capture node properties, typically learned through unsupervised structural similarity objectives or supervised tasks. While recent efforts have focused on explaining graph model decisions, the interpretability of unsupervised node embeddings remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiSeNE (Disentangled and Self-Explainable Node Embedding), a framework that generates self-explainable embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Our method employs disentangled representation learning to produce dimension-wise interpretable embeddings, where each dimension is aligned with distinct topological structure of the graph. We formalize novel desiderata for disentangled and interpretable embeddings, which drive our new objective functions, optimizing simultaneously for both interpretability and disentanglement. Additionally, we propose several new metrics to evaluate representation quality and human interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Hopfield-Fenchel-Young Networks: A Unified Framework for Associative Memory Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associative memory models, such as Hopfield networks and their modern variants, have garnered renewed interest due to advancements in memory capacity and connections with self-attention in transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>REX: Causal discovery based on machine learning and explainability techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques hold significant potential for enhancing the causal discovery process, which is crucial for understanding complex systems in areas like healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive the causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce ReX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that ReX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, ReX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase ReX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, ReX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Noise Robustness of Online Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is an emerging technique for uncertainty quantification that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true label with a predefined probability. Recent work develops online conformal prediction methods that adaptively construct prediction sets to accommodate distribution shifts. However, existing algorithms typically assume perfect label accuracy which rarely holds in practice. In this work, we investigate the robustness of online conformal prediction under uniform label noise with a known noise rate, in both constant and dynamic learning rate schedules. We show that label noise causes a persistent gap between the actual mis-coverage rate and the desired rate $\alpha$, leading to either overestimated or underestimated coverage guarantees. To address this issue, we propose Noise Robust Online Conformal Prediction (dubbed NR-OCP) by updating the threshold with a novel robust pinball loss, which provides an unbiased estimate of clean pinball loss without requiring ground-truth labels. Our theoretical analysis shows that NR-OCP eliminates the coverage gap in both constant and dynamic learning rate schedules, achieving a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$ for both empirical and expected coverage errors under uniform label noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving both precise coverage and improved efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spend Wisely: Maximizing Post-Training Gains in Iterative Synthetic Data Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern foundation models often undergo iterative ``bootstrapping'' in their post-training phase: a model generates synthetic data, an external verifier filters out low-quality samples, and the high-quality subset is used for further fine-tuning. Over multiple iterations, the model performance improves, raising a crucial question: How should the total budget for generation and training be allocated across iterations to maximize final performance? In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing budget allocation strategies. Specifically, we show that constant policies fail to converge with high probability, while increasing policies -- particularly exponential growth policies -- exhibit significant theoretical advantages. Experiments on image denoising with diffusion probabilistic models and math reasoning with large language models show that both exponential and polynomial growth policies consistently outperform constant policies, with exponential policies often providing more stable performance.</description>

      <title>FedRTS: Federated Robust Pruning via Combinatorial Thompson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without data sharing, but its high computational and communication demands strain resource-constrained devices. While existing methods use dynamic pruning to improve efficiency by periodically adjusting sparse model topologies while maintaining sparsity, these approaches suffer from issues such as greedy adjustments, unstable topologies, and communication inefficiency, resulting in less robust models and suboptimal performance under data heterogeneity and partial client availability. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Robust pruning via combinatorial Thompson Sampling (FedRTS), a novel framework designed to develop robust sparse models. FedRTS enhances robustness and performance through its Thompson Sampling-based Adjustment (TSAdj) mechanism, which uses probabilistic decisions informed by stable, farsighted information instead of deterministic decisions reliant on unstable and myopic information in previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in computer vision and natural language processing tasks while reducing communication costs, particularly excelling in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and partial client participation.

      <title>Tokenizing Single-Channel EEG with Time-Frequency Motif Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by 14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</description>

      <title>Strategyproof Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in settings where multiple labelers may strategically misreport feedback to steer the learned policy toward their own preferences. We show that existing RLHF algorithms, including recent pluralistic methods, are not strategyproof, and that even a single strategic labeler can cause arbitrarily large misalignment with social welfare. Moreover, we prove that, in the worst case, any strategyproof RLHF algorithm must perform $k$-times worse than the optimal policy, where $k$ is the number of labelers. This suggests a fundamental trade-off between incentive alignment (ensuring labelers report truthfully) and policy alignment (maximizing social welfare). To address this, we propose the Pessimistic Median of MLEs algorithm, which, under appropriate policy coverage assumptions, is approximately strategyproof and converges to the optimal policy as the number of labelers and samples increases. Our results apply to both contextual bandits and Markov decision processes.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Sparsity Artifacts in Crosscoders to Interpret Chat-Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as $\textit{false information}$ and $\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.</description>

      <title>Restoring Calibration for Aligned Large Language Models: A Calibration-Aware Fine-Tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</description>

Abstract: As the adoption of Generative AI in real-world services grow explosively, energy has emerged as a critical bottleneck resource. However, energy remains a metric that is often overlooked, under-explored, or poorly understood in the context of building ML systems. We present the ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark, a benchmark suite and tool for measuring inference energy consumption under realistic service environments, and the corresponding ML$.$ENERGY Leaderboard, which have served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark. We then highlight results from the early 2025 iteration of the benchmark, including energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model. The ML$.$ENERGY Benchmark is open-source and can be easily extended to various customized models and application scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model - ConDiSim, for simulation-based inference of complex systems with intractable likelihoods. ConDiSim leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models to approximate posterior distributions, consisting of a forward process that adds Gaussian noise to parameters, and a reverse process learning to denoise, conditioned on observed data. This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and multi-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark problems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and stability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference workflows requiring fast inference methods.</description>

Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood, with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics from Laplacian Eigenbasis for Neural Network Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Phi-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation, making it possible to acquire a potential {\phi} and corresponding charges \r{ho} linked to the learnable Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with insignificant computational overhead. Our results underscore how embedding a first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient, and lightweight in training.

      <title>KL-regularization Itself is Differentially Private in Bandits and RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for privacy, ensuring the outputs of data-driven algorithms remain statistically indistinguishable across datasets that differ in a single entry. While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Budget Allocation for Orthogonal-Subspace Adapter Tuning in LLMs Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned tasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although pioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task interference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the varying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive tuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple optimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential misalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies dynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in an end-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic bottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an efficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.To effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with the dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically between the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically allocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. OA-Adapter achieves higher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL benchmark, and maintains its advantages on two larger benchmarks comprising 15 tasks.</description>

      <title>Uni-LoRA: One Vector is All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection from a subspace R^d, with $d \ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection matrix, $P \in R^{D \times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing, thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric, enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead. Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM - making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution. Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive performance.</description>

      <title>WeightLoRA: Keep Only Necessary Adapters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values. We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa, BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Coordinate Momentum in SignSGD and Muon: Memory-Optimized Zero-Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose $\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

      <title>TimeRecipe: A Time-Series Forecasting Recipe via Benchmarking Module Level Effectiveness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is an essential task with wide real-world applications across domains. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level, offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level. TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons, and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights. The benchmark is available at: https://github.com/AdityaLab/TimeRecipe.</description>

      <title>When Style Breaks Safety: Defending LLMs Against Superficial Style Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce time-to-unsafe-sampling, a novel safety measure for generative models, defined as the number of generations required by a large language model (LLM) to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. While providing a new dimension for prompt-adaptive safety evaluation, quantifying time-to-unsafe-sampling is challenging: unsafe outputs are often rare in well-aligned models and thus may not be observed under any feasible sampling budget. To address this challenge, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis. We build on recent developments in conformal prediction and propose a novel calibration technique to construct a lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt with rigorous coverage guarantees. Our key technical innovation is an optimized sampling-budget allocation scheme that improves sample efficiency while maintaining distribution-free guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on both vision and language benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.</description>

      <title>Byzantine Failures Harm the Generalization of Robust Distributed Learning Algorithms More Than Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain reliable performance despite the presence of misbehaving workers. Such misbehaviors are commonly modeled as $\textit{Byzantine failures}$, allowing arbitrarily corrupted communication, or as $\textit{data poisoning}$, a weaker form of corruption restricted to local training data. While prior work shows similar optimization guarantees for both models, an important question remains: $\textit{How do these threat models impact generalization?}$ Empirical evidence suggests a gap, yet it remains unclear whether it is unavoidable or merely an artifact of suboptimal attacks. We show, for the first time, a fundamental gap in generalization guarantees between the two threat models: Byzantine failures yield strictly worse rates than those achievable under data poisoning. Our findings leverage a tight algorithmic stability analysis of robust distributed learning. Specifically, we prove that: $\textit{(i)}$ under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of an algorithm with optimal optimization guarantees degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ out of $n$ workers misbehaving; whereas $\textit{(ii)}$ under Byzantine failures, the degradation is in $\Omega \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}} \big)$.</description>

      <title>LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical process optimization maximizes production efficiency and economic performance, but optimization algorithms, including gradient-based solvers, numerical methods, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable. We present a multi-agent LLM framework that autonomously infers operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guides optimization. Our AutoGen-based framework employs OpenAI's o3 model with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation, and optimization guidance. Through autonomous constraint generation and iterative multi-agent optimization, the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on hydrodealkylation across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework achieved competitive performance with conventional methods while reducing wall-time 31-fold relative to grid search, converging in under 20 minutes. The reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. Unlike conventional methods requiring predefined constraints, our approach uniquely combines autonomous constraint generation with interpretable parameter exploration. Model comparison reveals reasoning-capable architectures (o3, o1) are essential for successful optimization, while standard models fail to converge. This approach is particularly valuable for emerging processes and retrofit applications where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate substantial promise for advancing scientific discovery, yet their deployment in disciplines demanding factual precision and specialized domain constraints presents significant challenges. Within molecular design for pharmaceutical development, these models can propose innovative molecular modifications but frequently generate chemically infeasible structures. We introduce VALID-Mol, a comprehensive framework that integrates chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design, achieving an improvement in valid chemical structure generation from 3% to 83%. Our methodology synthesizes systematic prompt optimization, automated chemical verification, and domain-adapted fine-tuning to ensure dependable generation of synthesizable molecules with enhanced properties. Our contribution extends beyond implementation details to provide a transferable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications with measurable reliability enhancements. Computational analyses indicate our framework generates promising synthesis candidates with up to 17-fold predicted improvements in target binding affinity while preserving synthetic feasibility.</description>

      <title>BoltzNCE: Learning Likelihoods for Boltzmann Generation with Stochastic Interpolants and Noise Contrastive Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution given its energy function is a key challenge for modeling complex physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators address this problem by leveraging continuous normalizing flows to transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the target using sample likelihoods. Despite the elegance of this approach, obtaining these likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, which is impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this difficulty, we train an energy-based model (EBM) to approximate likelihoods using both noise contrastive estimation (NCE) and score matching, which we show outperforms the use of either objective in isolation. On 2d synthetic systems where failure can be easily visualized, NCE improves mode weighting relative to score matching alone. On alanine dipeptide, our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions that closely match those obtained using exact likelihoods while achieving $100\times$ faster inference. By training on multiple dipeptide systems, we show that our approach also exhibits effective transfer learning, generalizing to new systems at inference time and achieving at least a $6\times$ speedup over standard MD. While many recent efforts in generative modeling have prioritized models with fast sampling, our work demonstrates the design of models with accelerated likelihoods, enabling the application of reweighting schemes that ensure unbiased Boltzmann statistics at scale.

      <description>arXiv:2507.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques towards matching a gradient flow, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.</description>

      <title>Innovator: Scientific Continued Pretraining with Fine-grained MoE Upcycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1) Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets. Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64 specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99% performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements over 30%.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step sampling during flow policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two algorithm variants based on rectified flow policy and MeanFlow policy, respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo and visual DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while requiring orders of magnitude less computational cost during inference.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.</description>

      <title>Provable Mixed-Noise Learning with Flow-Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Merge-of-Thought Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite the practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora. We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different "best teachers," and even for the same student, the best teacher can vary across datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into a student to overcome conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math benchmarks, using only about 200 CoT samples, applying MoT to a Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including Deepseek-R1, Qwen3-32B, and OpenAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics while reducing catastrophic forgetting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers. Finally, we have demonstrated MoT possesses consensus CoT by eliminating teacher-specific inductive biases and inter-teacher conflicts while repeatedly reinforcing the learning of consensus reasoning features. These results position MoT as a simple, effective route to efficiently distilling long CoT capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.</description>

      <title>Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Extrapolation in Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many common estimators in machine learning and causal inference are linear smoothers, where the prediction is a weighted average of the training outcomes. Some estimators, such as ordinary least squares and kernel ridge regression, allow for arbitrarily negative weights, which improve feature imbalance but often at the cost of increased dependence on parametric modeling assumptions and higher variance. By contrast, estimators like importance weighting and random forests (sometimes implicitly) restrict weights to be non-negative, reducing dependence on parametric modeling and variance at the cost of worse imbalance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that directly penalizes the level of extrapolation, replacing the current practice of a hard non-negativity constraint with a soft constraint and corresponding hyperparameter. We derive a worst-case extrapolation error bound and introduce a novel "bias-bias-variance" tradeoff, encompassing biases due to feature imbalance, model misspecification, and estimator variance; this tradeoff is especially pronounced in high dimensions, particularly when positivity is poor. We then develop an optimization procedure that regularizes this bound while minimizing imbalance and outline how to use this approach as a sensitivity analysis for dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through synthetic experiments and a real-world application, involving the generalization of randomized controlled trial estimates to a target population of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere. Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx, inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc 97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc 96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Promise and Performance for Microscaling FP4 Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and 2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the point where it can near the accuracy that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>PATCH: Learnable Tile-level Hybrid Sparsity for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere, preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.</description>

      <title>Robust Policy Expansion for Offline-to-Online RL under Diverse Data Corruption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

      <title>Beyond Linear Probes: Dynamic Safety Monitoring for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at http://github.com/james-oldfield/tpc.</description>

      <title>Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

      <title>Lightweight Transformer for EEG Classification via Balanced Signed Graph Algorithm Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph -- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Merge and Guide: Unifying Model Merging and Guided Decoding for Controllable Multi-Objective Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting to diverse user needs at test time is a key challenge in controllable multi-objective generation. Existing methods are insufficient: merging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter level, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While decoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating logits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and relying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we introduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model merging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem between the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by dynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone models that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and implicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the decoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship between model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced controllability afforded by our approach. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior controllability, Pareto-optimal performance, and enhanced adaptability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off in Concept-Based Sidechannel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy. Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a principled manner.</description>

      <title>Best-of-Both Worlds for linear contextual bandits with paid observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations, where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'', using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Sharpness: A Novel Sharpness that Strongly Correlates with Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be. Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure, i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform} (identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the \textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the classical SAM method.</description>

      <title>Think Just Enough: Sequence-Level Entropy as a Confidence Signal for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50% computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Bias: A Study on Explicit and Implicit Political Stereotypes in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.</description>

      <title>TinyGraphEstimator: Adapting Lightweight Language Models for Graph Structure Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from graph representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number. Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments, enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Synthetic Data Generation with Post Hoc Calibration for Clinical Tabular Datasets</title>

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR, restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods: noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around 0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%, confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.</description>

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single information-geometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a path to trusted capability</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two fields of urban planning and artificial intelligence (AI) arose and developed separately. However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we introduce the importance of urban planning from the sustainability, living, economic, disaster, and environmental perspectives. We review the fundamental concepts of urban planning and relate these concepts to crucial open problems of machine learning, including adversarial learning, generative neural networks, deep encoder-decoder networks, conversational AI, and geospatial and temporal machine learning, thereby assaying how AI can contribute to modern urban planning. Thus, a central problem is automated land-use configuration, which is formulated as the generation of land uses and building configuration for a target area from surrounding geospatial, human mobility, social media, environment, and economic activities. Finally, we delineate some implications of AI for urban planning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both topics.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Uncertain Maximum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Principle of Maximum Entropy is a rigorous technique for estimating an unknown distribution given partial information while simultaneously minimizing bias. However, an important requirement for applying the principle is that the available information be provided error-free (Jaynes 1982). We relax this requirement using a memoryless communication channel as a framework to derive a new, more general principle. We show our new principle provides an upper bound on the entropy of the unknown distribution and the amount of information lost due to the use of a given communications channel is unknown unless the unknown distribution's entropy is also known. Using our new principle we provide a new interpretation of the classic principle and experimentally show its performance relative to the classic principle and other generally applicable solutions. Finally, we present a simple algorithm for solving our new principle and an approximation useful when samples are limited.</description>

      <title>SoK: Adversarial Evasion Attacks Practicality in NIDS Domain and the Impact of Dynamic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has become pervasive, and its deployment in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is inevitable due to its automated nature and high accuracy compared to traditional models in processing and classifying large volumes of data. However, ML has been found to have several flaws, most importantly, adversarial attacks, which aim to trick ML models into producing faulty predictions. While most adversarial attack research focuses on computer vision datasets, recent studies have explored the suitability of these attacks against ML-based network security entities, especially NIDS, due to the wide difference between different domains regarding the generation of adversarial attacks.
  To further explore the practicality of adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS in-depth, this paper presents several key contributions: identifying numerous practicality issues for evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS using an attack tree threat model, introducing a taxonomy of practicality issues associated with adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS, identifying specific leaf nodes in our attack tree that demonstrate some practicality for real-world implementation and conducting a comprehensive review and exploration of these potentially viable attack approaches, and investigating how the dynamicity of real-world ML models affects evasion adversarial attacks against NIDS. Our experiments indicate that continuous re-training, even without adversarial training, can reduce the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. While adversarial attacks can compromise ML-based NIDSs, our aim is to highlight the significant gap between research and real-world practicality in this domain, which warrants attention.</description>

      <title>Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation of Textual Adversarial Examples (IT-DT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based text classifiers like BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-3 have shown impressive performance in NLP. However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT) framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making, especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the derivative-free loss method for solving PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes the derivative-free loss method to solve a certain class of elliptic PDEs and fluid problems using neural networks. The approach leverages the Feynman-Kac formulation, incorporating stochastic walkers and their averaged values. We investigate how the time interval associated with the Feynman-Kac representation and the walker size influence computational efficiency, trainability, and sampling errors. Our analysis shows that the training loss bias scales proportionally with the time interval and the spatial gradient of the neural network, while being inversely proportional to the walker size. Moreover, we demonstrate that the time interval must be sufficiently long to enable effective training. These results indicate that the walker size can be chosen as small as possible, provided it satisfies the optimal lower bound determined by the time interval. Finally, we present numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Integrating feature selection and regression methods with technical indicators for predicting Apple Inc. stock prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09903v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stock price prediction is influenced by a variety of factors, including technical indicators, which makes Feature selection crucial for identifying the most relevant predictors. This study examines the impact of feature selection on stock price prediction accuracy using technical indicators. A total of 123 technical indicators and 10 regression models were evaluated using 13 years of Apple Inc. data. The primary goal is to identify the best combination of indicators and models for improved forecasting. The results show that a 3-day time window provides the highest prediction accuracy. Model performance was assessed using five error-based metrics. Among the models, Linear Regression and Ridge Regression achieved the best overall performance, each with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00025. Applying feature selection significantly improved model accuracy. For example, the Multi-layered Perceptron Regression using Forward Selection improved by 56.47% over its baseline version. Support Vector Regression improved by 67.42%, and Linear Regression showed a 76.7% improvement when combined with Forward Selection. Ridge Regression also demonstrated a 72.82% enhancement. Additionally, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest models showed varying levels of improvement when used with Backward Selection. The most effective technical indicators for stock price prediction were found to be Squeeze_pro, Percentage Price Oscillator, Thermo, Decay, Archer On-Balance Volume, Bollinger Bands, Squeeze, and Ichimoku. Overall, the study highlights that combining selected technical indicators with appropriate regression models can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of stock price predictions.</description>

      <title>Improving Intrusion Detection with Domain-Invariant Representation Learning in Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-day anomaly detection is critical in industrial applications where novel, unforeseen threats can compromise system integrity and safety. Traditional detection systems often fail to identify these unseen anomalies due to their reliance on in-distribution data. Domain generalization addresses this gap by leveraging knowledge from multiple known domains to detect out-of-distribution events. In this work, we introduce a multi-task representation learning technique that fuses information across related domains into a unified latent space. By jointly optimizing classification, reconstruction, and mutual information regularization losses, our method learns a minimal(bottleneck), domain-invariant representation that discards spurious correlations. This latent space decorrelation enhances generalization, enabling the detection of anomalies in unseen domains. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-day or novel anomaly detection across diverse anomaly detection datasets.</description>

      <title>SOHES: Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-world entity segmentation, as an emerging computer vision task, aims at segmenting entities in images without being restricted by pre-defined classes, offering impressive generalization capabilities on unseen images and concepts. Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that eliminates the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pre-trained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudo-labels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.

      <title>Approximation Rates for Shallow ReLU$^k$ Neural Networks on Sobolev Spaces via the Radon Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. We consider the problem of how efficiently shallow neural networks with the ReLU$^k$ activation function can approximate functions from Sobolev spaces $W^s(L_p(\Omega))$ with error measured in the $L_q(\Omega)$-norm. Utilizing the Radon transform and recent results from discrepancy theory, we provide a simple proof of nearly optimal approximation rates in a variety of cases, including when $q\leq p$, $p\geq 2$, and $s \leq k + (d+1)/2$. The rates we derive are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly generalize existing results. An interesting consequence is that the adaptivity of shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks enables them to obtain optimal approximation rates for smoothness up to order $s = k + (d+1)/2$, even though they represent piecewise polynomials of fixed degree $k$.</description>

      <title>Generating High Dimensional User-Specific Wireless Channels using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit model (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our diffusion-based augmentation approach achieves over a 1-2 dB gain in NMSE for channel compression, and an 11dB SNR boost in beamforming compared to prior methods, such as noise addition or the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs).</description>

      <title>MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</description>

      <title>SFTMix: Elevating Language Model Instruction Tuning with Mixup Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To acquire instruction-following capabilities, large language models (LLMs) undergo instruction tuning, where they are trained on instruction-response pairs using next-token prediction (NTP). Efforts to improve instruction tuning often focus on higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, typically requiring data filtering with proprietary LLMs or human annotation. In this paper, we take a different approach by proposing SFTMix, a novel Mixup-based recipe that elevates LLM instruction tuning without relying on well-curated datasets. We observe that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic representation space. We argue that examples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles in instruction tuning: Confident data is prone to overfitting, while unconfident data is harder to generalize. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels. We then interpolate them to bridge the confidence gap and apply a Mixup-based regularization to support learning on these additional, interpolated examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SFTMix in both instruction-following and healthcare-specific SFT tasks, with consistent improvements across LLM families and SFT datasets of varying sizes and qualities. Extensive analyses across six directions highlight SFTMix's compatibility with data selection, adaptability to compute-constrained scenarios, and scalability to broader applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent Visual Grounding in Large Multimodal Models Without Grounding Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

      <title>Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Learning Robot Manipulation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>VERITAS: Verifying the Performance of AI-native Transceiver Actions in Base-Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native receivers prove significant performance improvement in high noise regimes and can potentially reduce communication overhead compared to the traditional receiver. However, their performance highly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue is the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments and waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in practical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint measurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment, called VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received signals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless channel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects out-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As soon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is activated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native receiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and the reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether or not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that VERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely initiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with the Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, accurately quantifying uncertainty in their predictions is essential to ensure their trustworthiness and enable widespread adoption in critical systems. Several Bayesian uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods exist that are either cheap or reliable, but not both. We propose a post-hoc, sampling-based UQ method for over-parameterized networks at the end of training. Our approach constructs efficient and meaningful deep ensembles by employing a (stochastic) gradient-descent sampling process on appropriately linearized networks. We demonstrate that our method effectively approximates the posterior of a Gaussian process using the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that our method not only outperforms competing approaches in computational efficiency-often reducing costs by multiple factors-but also maintains state-of-the-art performance across a variety of UQ metrics for both regression and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sakana's AI Scientist: Bold Claims, Mixed Results, and a Promising Future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Sakana recently introduced the 'AI Scientist', claiming to conduct research autonomously, i.e. they imply to have achieved what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). The AI Scientist gained much attention, but a thorough independent evaluation has yet to be conducted.
  Our evaluation of the AI Scientist reveals critical shortcomings. The system's literature reviews produced poor novelty assessments, often misclassifying established concepts (e.g., micro-batching for stochastic gradient descent) as novel. It also struggles with experiment execution: 42% of experiments failed due to coding errors, while others produced flawed or misleading results. Code modifications were minimal, averaging 8% more characters per iteration, suggesting limited adaptability. Generated manuscripts were poorly substantiated, with a median of five citations, most outdated (only five of 34 from 2020 or later). Structural errors were frequent, including missing figures, repeated sections, and placeholder text like 'Conclusions Here'. Some papers contained hallucinated numerical results.
  Despite these flaws, the AI Scientist represents a leap forward in research automation. It generates full research manuscripts with minimal human input, challenging expectations of AI-driven science. Many reviewers might struggle to distinguish its work from human researchers. While its quality resembles a rushed undergraduate paper, its speed and cost efficiency are unprecedented, producing a full paper for USD 6 to 15 with 3.5 hours of human involvement, far outpacing traditional researchers.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Kernel Two-Sample Tests with Random Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embedding of probability distributions has proved to be an effective approach, via MMD (maximum mean discrepancy), for nonparametric hypothesis testing problems involving distributions defined over general (non-Euclidean) domains. While a substantial amount of work has been done on this topic, only recently have minimax optimal two-sample tests been constructed that incorporate, unlike MMD, both the mean element and a regularized version of the covariance operator. However, as with most kernel algorithms, the optimal test scales cubically in the sample size, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we propose a spectral-regularized two-sample test based on random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation and investigate the trade-offs between statistical optimality and computational efficiency. We show the proposed test to be minimax optimal if the approximation order of RFF (which depends on the smoothness of the likelihood ratio and the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the integral operator) is sufficiently large. We develop a practically implementable permutation-based version of the proposed test with a data-adaptive strategy for selecting the regularization parameter. Finally, through numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed RFF-based test is computationally efficient and performs almost similarly (with a small drop in power) to the exact test.</description>

      <title>Technical and legal aspects of federated learning in bioinformatics: applications, challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. This paper provides a gentle introduction to this approach in bioinformatics, and is the first to review key applications in proteomics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), single-cell and multi-omics studies in their legal as well as methodological and infrastructural challenges. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have a similar impact in bioinformatics, allowing academic and clinical institutions to access many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reasoning with LLMs for k-anonymity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.</description>

      <title>ELASTIC: Efficient Once For All Iterative Search for Object Detection on Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying high-performance object detectors on TinyML platforms poses significant challenges due to tight hardware constraints and the modular complexity of modern detection pipelines. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Partially stochastic deep learning with uncertainty quantification for model predictive heating control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making the control of building heating systems more energy efficient is crucial for reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional rule-based control methods use a static, outdoor temperature-dependent heating curve to regulate heat input. This open-loop approach fails to account for both the current state of the system (indoor temperature) and free heat gains, such as solar radiation, often resulting in poor thermal comfort and overheating. Model Predictive Control (MPC) addresses these drawbacks by using predictive modeling to optimize heating based on a building's learned thermal behavior, current system state, and weather forecasts. However, current industrial MPC solutions often employ simplified physics-inspired indoor temperature models, sacrificing accuracy for robustness and interpretability. While purely data-driven models offer superior predictive performance and therefore more accurate control, they face challenges such as a lack of transparency.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a partially stochastic deep learning (DL) architecture, dubbed LSTM+BNN, for building-specific indoor temperature modeling. Unlike most studies that evaluate model performance through simulations or limited test buildings, our experiments across a comprehensive dataset of 100 real-world buildings, under various weather conditions, demonstrate that LSTM+BNN outperforms an industry-proven reference model, reducing the average prediction error measured as RMSE by more than 40% for the 48-hour prediction horizon of interest. Unlike deterministic DL approaches, LSTM+BNN offers a critical advantage by enabling pre-assessment of model competency for control optimization through uncertainty quantification. Thus, the proposed model shows significant potential to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency achieved with heating MPC solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning how the world works is central to building AI agents that can adapt to complex environments. Traditional world models based on deep learning demand vast amounts of training data, and do not flexibly update their knowledge from sparse observations. Recent advances in program synthesis using Large Language Models (LLMs) give an alternate approach which learns world models represented as source code, supporting strong generalization from little data. To date, application of program-structured world models remains limited to natural language and grid-world domains. We introduce a novel program synthesis method for effectively modeling complex, non-gridworld domains by representing a world model as an exponentially-weighted product of programmatic experts (PoE-World) synthesized by LLMs. We show that this approach can learn complex, stochastic world models from just a few observations. We evaluate the learned world models by embedding them in a model-based planning agent, demonstrating efficient performance and generalization to unseen levels on Atari's Pong and Montezuma's Revenge. We release our code and display the learned world models and videos of the agent's gameplay at https://topwasu.github.io/poe-world.</description>

      <title>SPIRIT: Patching Speech Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern consumer banking applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems. Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our framework features a few-shot example strategy, where each agent receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world major bank dataset as well as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a 14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public benchmarks when compared with traditional and single-agent annotation techniques. Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making it well-suited for deployment in production banking applications while showing strong generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.</description>

Abstract: Reliable probabilities are critical in high-risk applications, yet common calibration criteria (confidence, class-wise) are only necessary for full distributional calibration, and post-hoc methods often lack distribution-free guarantees.
  We propose a set-based notion of calibration, cumulative mass calibration, and a corresponding empirical error measure: the Cumulative Mass Calibration Error (CMCE). We develop a new calibration procedure that starts with conformal prediction to obtain a set of labels that gives the desired coverage.
  We then instantiate two simple post-hoc calibrators: a mass normalization and a temperature scaling-based rule, tuned to the conformal constraint.
  On multi-class image benchmarks, especially with a large number of classes, our methods consistently improve CMCE and standard metrics (ECE, cw-ECE, MCE) over baselines, delivering a practical, scalable framework with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Checkpoint-GCG: Auditing and Attacking Fine-Tuning-Based Prompt Injection Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems, where they are expected to process untrusted data and follow trusted instructions. Failure to distinguish between the two poses significant security risks, exploited by prompt injection attacks, which inject malicious instructions into the data to control model outputs. Model-level defenses have been proposed to mitigate prompt injection attacks. These defenses fine-tune LLMs to ignore injected instructions in untrusted data. We introduce Checkpoint-GCG, a white-box attack against fine-tuning-based defenses. Checkpoint-GCG enhances the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack by leveraging intermediate model checkpoints produced during fine-tuning to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one to continuously improve attacks. First, we instantiate Checkpoint-GCG to evaluate the robustness of the state-of-the-art defenses in an auditing setup, assuming both (a) full knowledge of the model input and (b) access to intermediate model checkpoints. We show Checkpoint-GCG to achieve up to $96\%$ attack success rate (ASR) against the strongest defense. Second, we relax the first assumption by searching for a universal suffix that would work on unseen inputs, and obtain up to $89.9\%$ ASR against the strongest defense. Finally, we relax both assumptions by searching for a universal suffix that would transfer to similar black-box models and defenses, achieving an ASR of $63.9\%$ against a newly released defended model from Meta.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models through Image-Guided Head Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference, without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives.

      <title>Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.</description>

      <title>Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models and the source code.</description>

      <title>Echoes of BERT: Do Modern Language Models Rediscover the Classical NLP Pipeline?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information relies primarily on studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. Building on classic BERTology work, we analyze 25 models spanning from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1), probing layer-by-layer representations across eight linguistic tasks in English. Consistent with earlier findings, we find that hierarchical organization persists in modern models: early layers capture syntax, middle layers handle semantics and entity-level information, and later layers encode discourse phenomena. We dive deeper, conducting an in-depth multilingual analysis of two specific linguistic properties - lexical identity and inflectional morphology - that help disentangle form from meaning. We find that lexical information concentrates linearly in early layers but becomes increasingly nonlinear deeper in the network, while inflectional information remains linearly accessible throughout all layers. Additional analyses of attention mechanisms, steering vectors, and pretraining checkpoints reveal where this information resides within layers, how it can be functionally manipulated, and how representations evolve during pretraining. Taken together, our findings suggest that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models learn to organize linguistic information in similar ways, regardless of model architecture, size, or training regime, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction.

      <description>arXiv:2506.02685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure, SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations. Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the target distribution.</description>

      <title>KScope: A Framework for Characterizing the Knowledge Status of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2) Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong. (4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes across LLMs.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Disentanglement by Backpropagation with Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics, ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.</description>

      <title>R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</description>

      <title>Online Continual Learning via Spiking Neural Networks with Sleep Enhanced Latent Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Detecting Token-Level Hallucinations Using Variance Signals: A Reference-Free Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of pursuit-evasion, we present a motion planning framework that combines energy-based diffusion models with artificial potential fields for robust real time trajectory generation in complex environments. Our approach processes obstacle information directly from point clouds, enabling efficient planning without requiring complete geometric representations. The framework employs classifier-free guidance training and integrates local potential fields during sampling to enhance obstacle avoidance. In dynamic scenarios, the system generates initial trajectories using the diffusion model and continuously refines them through potential field-based adaptation, demonstrating effective performance in pursuit-evasion scenarios with partial pursuer observability.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hyperparameter Optimization Effects on Lightweight Deep Models for Real-Time Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based networks are increasingly preferred for real-time image classification, especially on resource-constrained devices. This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter optimization on the accuracy and deployment feasibility of seven modern lightweight architectures: ConvNeXt-T, EfficientNetV2-S, MobileNetV3-L, MobileViT v2 (S/XS), RepVGG-A2, and TinyViT-21M, trained on a class-balanced subset of 90,000 images from ImageNet-1K. Under standardized training settings, this paper investigates the influence of learning rate schedules, augmentation, optimizers, and initialization on model performance. Inference benchmarks are performed using an NVIDIA L40s GPU with batch sizes ranging from 1 to 512, capturing latency and throughput in real-time conditions. This work demonstrates that controlled hyperparameter variation significantly alters convergence dynamics in lightweight CNN and transformer backbones, providing insight into stability regions and deployment feasibility in edge artificial intelligence. Our results reveal that tuning alone leads to a top-1 accuracy improvement of 1.5 to 3.5 percent over baselines, and select models (e.g., RepVGG-A2, MobileNetV3-L) deliver latency under 5 milliseconds and over 9,800 frames per second, making them ideal for edge deployment. This work provides reproducible, subset-based insights into lightweight hyperparameter tuning and its role in balancing speed and accuracy.

      <title>Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns - stability - and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes - plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity. Although additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. Paper2Agent automatically created AI co-scientist that identified new splicing variant associated with ADHD risk. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision, especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.</description>

      <title>EdiVal-Agent: An Object-Centric Framework for Automated, Fine-Grained Evaluation of Multi-Turn Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images-resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models-or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated and fine-grained evaluation framework grounded in an object-centric perspective, designed to assess not only standard single-turn but also multi-turn instruction-based editing with precision. Given an input image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions while dynamically updating object pools across turns. These two stages enable two novel object-centric metrics tailored for multi-turn evaluation and one global metric of visual quality: (1) EdiVal-IF, which measures instruction following by combining open-vocabulary object detectors for symbolic checks with VLMs for semantic verification on detector-guided crops; (2) EdiVal-CC, which evaluates content consistency by calculating semantic similarity of unchanged objects and background using the evolving object pools; and (3) EdiVal-VQ, which quantifies changes in overall visual quality with human preference models. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 13 state-of-the-art editing models spanning in-context, flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.</description>

      <title>SteeringSafety: A Systematic Safety Evaluation Framework of Representation Steering in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SteeringSafety, a systematic framework for evaluating representation steering methods across seven safety perspectives spanning 17 datasets. While prior work highlights general capabilities of representation steering, we systematically explore safety perspectives including bias, harmfulness, hallucination, social behaviors, reasoning, epistemic integrity, and normative judgment. Our framework provides modularized building blocks for state-of-the-art steering methods, enabling unified implementation of DIM, ACE, CAA, PCA, and LAT with recent enhancements like conditional steering. Results on Gemma-2-2B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen-2.5-7B reveal that strong steering performance depends critically on pairing of method, model, and specific perspective. DIM shows consistent effectiveness, but all methods exhibit substantial entanglement: social behaviors show highest vulnerability (reaching degradation as high as 76%), jailbreaking often compromises normative judgment, and hallucination steering unpredictably shifts political views. Our findings underscore the critical need for holistic safety evaluations.</description>

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of McTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may incorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not respected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.</description>

      <title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.</description>

      <title>Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical corporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before they cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further research.</description>

      <title>All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.</description>

      <title>Are Large Reasoning Models Interruptible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness: even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes, including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

      <title>DiSTAR: Diffusion over a Scalable Token Autoregressive Representation for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity.

      <title>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP and Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.</description>

      <title>Adapting Noise to Data: Generative Flows from 1D Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Protenix-Mini+: efficient structure prediction model with scalable pairformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g., Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1) compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2) removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and (3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</description>

      <title>Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.</description>
