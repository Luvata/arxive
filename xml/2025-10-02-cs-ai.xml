      <title>Blueprint-Bench: Comparing spatial intelligence of LLMs, agents and image models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality (photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5, Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image, NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50 apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.</description>

      <title>The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN, including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.</description>

      <title>A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast, Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance for choosing between reasoning paradigms.

      <title>Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Qualitative Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor. Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative research's humanistic commitments.

      <title>Memory Management and Contextual Consistency for Long-Running Low-Code Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However, a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation" issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates, contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable of effective long-term learning and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2 to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.</description>

      <title>Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning, that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.</description>

      <title>RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.</description>

      <title>RL in the Wild: Characterizing RLVR Training in LLM Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads, inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</description>

      <title>ID-RAG: Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Long-Horizon Persona Coherence in Generative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures, including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic, structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents.

      <title>Flash-Searcher: Fast and Effective Web Agents via DAG-Based Parallel Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks. Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication Risk in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical deployment of LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous High-Order Generalization in Neural Theory-of-Mind Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast, neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations. Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>SynthPert: Enhancing LLM Biological Reasoning via Synthetic Reasoning Traces for Cellular Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Structural Reward Model: Enhancing Interpretability, Efficiency, and Scalability in Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios, allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.</description>

      <title>Where LLM Agents Fail and How They can Learn From Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory, reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way, and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action, and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24% higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AgentDebug</description>

      <title>From Perception to Cognition: A Survey of Vision-Language Interactive Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</description>

      <title>Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing paired studies from different time points and answering questions about clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop: step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency; step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA.</description>

      <title>Boolean Satisfiability via Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions. Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration, yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT</description>

      <title>Adaptive Test-Time Reasoning via Reward-Guided Dual-Phase Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection. Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves accuracy while reducing redundant computation.</description>

      <title>RADAR: Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing for Reasoning LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR (Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable, and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to different queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.</description>

      <title>The Open Syndrome Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at https://github.com/OpenSyndrome/schema under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>GESA: Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation for Generalized, Fair, and Explainable Candidate-Role Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring, academic admissions, fellowship awards, and volunteer placement systems. Current state-of-the-art approaches suffer from semantic inflexibility, persistent demographic bias, opacity in decision-making processes, and poor scalability under dynamic policy constraints. We present GESA (Graph-Enhanced Semantic Allocation), a comprehensive framework that addresses these limitations through the integration of domain-adaptive transformer embeddings, heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic cate- gories, and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.</description>

      <title>DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Emotion Graphs for Compositional Prompting in Zero-Shot Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features (e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy over zero-shot baselines.</description>

      <title>TDHook: A Lightweight Framework for Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source, lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$ and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as $\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a $\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as with complex models in DRL.</description>

      <title>Message passing-based inference in an autoregressive active inference agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks. Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.</description>

      <title>Beyond Static Retrieval: Opportunities and Pitfalls of Iterative Retrieval in GraphRAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering. Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities, is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval, which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood. We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.</description>

      <title>RadOnc-GPT: An Autonomous LLM Agent for Real-Time Patient Outcomes Labeling at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.</description>

      <title>Learning to Interact in World Latent for Team Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Foundation Models with Pathological Concept Learning for Kidney Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate the translational capabilities of foundation models, we develop a pathological concept learning approach focused on kidney cancer. By leveraging TNM staging guidelines and pathology reports, we build comprehensive pathological concepts for kidney cancer. Then, we extract deep features from whole slide images using foundation models, construct pathological graphs to capture spatial correlations, and trained graph neural networks to identify these concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in kidney cancer survival analysis, highlighting its explainability and fairness in identifying low- and high-risk patients. The source code has been released by https://github.com/shangqigao/RadioPath.</description>

      <title>A(I)nimism: Re-enchanting the World Through AI-Mediated Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request, conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives, speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new questions of agency, responsibility, and design.</description>

      <title>Radiology's Last Exam (RadLE): Benchmarking Frontier Multimodal AI Against Human Experts and a Taxonomy of Visual Reasoning Errors in Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined. Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%), outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding more robust model development.</description>

      <title>IRIS: Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.</description>

      <title>Skip-It? Theoretical Conditions for Layer Skipping in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Constraints-Aware Multi-Agent Collaboration for Real-World Travel Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).</description>

      <title>Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits: state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.</description>

      <title>Causal Autoencoder-like Generation of Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with an LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reward Normalization for Process-supervised Non-verifiable Agentic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback, which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without "golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Humanity: Exploring the Perceived Humanness of AI Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and, conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair, the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback, revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Studying AI Agent Behavior: Evidence from Consumer Choice Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf. These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges, all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable evaluation of agent decision-making.</description>

      <title>SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users' right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.</description>

      <title>SOCK: A Benchmark for Measuring Self-Replication in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes, Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL). Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research, to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of more functional multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>AutoLabs: Cognitive Multi-Agent Systems with Self-Correction for Autonomous Chemical Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs) promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over 85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy (F1-score &gt; 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and reliability in high-stakes scientific applications.

      <title>Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism: An Integrated Approach for Audio-Visual Navigation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior navigation performance.</description>

      <title>Landmark-Guided Knowledge for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism, which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.</description>

      <title>On Explaining Proxy Discrimination and Unfairness in Individual Decisions Made by AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions. Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in real-world cases.</description>

      <title>GroundSight: Augmenting Vision-Language Models with Grounding Information and De-hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79% to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.</description>

      <title>SING-SQL: A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for In-Domain Text-to-SQL Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database, without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and 73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale, SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49 in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable, database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL systems.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Compression for Large-Scale MoE Deployment on Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3 from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have contributed to the rise of advanced conversational assistants that can assist with user needs through natural language conversation. This paper presents a ScheduleMe, a multi-agent calendar assistant for users to manage google calendar events in natural language. The system uses a graph-structured coordination mechanism where a central supervisory agent supervises specialized task agents, allowing modularity, conflicts resolution, and context-aware interactions to resolve ambiguities and evaluate user commands. This approach sets an example of how structured reasoning and agent cooperation might convince operators to increase the usability and flexibility of personal calendar assistant tools.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Diverse Behavioral Traffic: A Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</description>

      <title>NePTune: A Neuro-Pythonic Framework for Tunable Compositional Reasoning on Vision-Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore, we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses, we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off: strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations. More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design, emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.</description>

      <title>Galton's Law of Mediocrity: Why Large Language Models Regress to the Mean and Fail at Creativity in Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe, generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors, emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained, showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals. We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality. Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing creativity-sensitive models.</description>

      <title>Planner-R1: Reward Shaping Enables Efficient Agentic RL with Smaller LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the \textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a \textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$ improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics, making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including \textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL, highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of defining a semantics for deontic argumentation that supports weak permission. Some recent results show that grounded semantics do not support weak permission when there is a conflict between two obligations. We provide a definition of Deontic Argumentation Theory that accounts for weak permission, and we recall the result about grounded semantics. Then, we propose a new semantics that supports weak permission.</description>

      <title>PUREVQ-GAN: Defending Data Poisoning Attacks through Vector-Quantized Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook, PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations. On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making it practical for real training pipelines.</description>

      <title>Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference. Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting, but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500. Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades. Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.</description>

      <title>HiStyle: Hierarchical Style Embedding Predictor for Text-Prompt-Guided Controllable Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern: embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces. Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

      <title>ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful, mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis. Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable AI safety.</description>

      <title>CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory (CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters, quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of 73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at https://github.com/OlgaKrestinskaya/CIMNAS.</description>

      <title>Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.</description>

      <title>SafeMind: Benchmarking and Mitigating Safety Risks in Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations. Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm, privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion. Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.</description>

      <title>DeepJSONEval: Benchmarking Complex Nested JSON Data Mining for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying. For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata (title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information (multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring 2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to advance research in structured JSON generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of vital signs in healthcare has witnessed a steady rise, promising health professionals to assist in their daily tasks to improve patient treatment. In life-threatening situations, like rescue operations, crucial decisions need to be made in the shortest possible amount of time to ensure that excellent treatment is provided during life-saving measurements. The integration of vital signs in the treatment holds the potential to improve time utilization for rescuers in such critical situations. They furthermore serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during rescue operations and show their impact on health professionals and patients in need.</description>

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible. Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations, real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast, accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14 participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.</description>

      <title>NuRisk: A Visual Question Answering Dataset for Agent-Level Risk Assessment in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context. Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Automated Model Discovery via Multi-modal &amp; Multi-step Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper, we present a multi-modal \&amp; multi-step pipeline for effective automated model discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM), AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering favorable models.</description>

      <title>RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks) and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Robust LLM Unlearning by Correcting Responses with Retrieved Exclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning. Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability. To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions (CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision. By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a system that enables real-time interaction between human users and agents trained to control fighter jets in simulated 3D air combat scenarios. The agents are trained in a dedicated environment using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. A communication link is developed to allow seamless deployment of trained agents into VR-Forces, a widely used defense simulation tool for realistic tactical scenarios. This integration allows mixed simulations where human-controlled entities engage with intelligent agents exhibiting distinct combat behaviors. Our interaction model creates new opportunities for human-agent teaming, immersive training, and the exploration of innovative tactics in defense contexts.</description>

      <title>CoLLM-NAS: Collaborative Large Language Models for Efficient Knowledge-Guided Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations, including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction. CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its excellent generalization.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models as Synthetic Social Agents in Social Science Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model. However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.</description>

      <title>SafeEvalAgent: Toward Agentic and Self-Evolving Safety Evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However, existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI.</description>

      <title>MEDAKA: Construction of Biomedical Knowledge Graphs Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events, overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1) a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings, contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/medakakg/medaka.</description>

      <title>LMILAtt: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Social Media Users Enhanced by Multi-Instance Learning Based on Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model, which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally, the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Algorithm: A Field Guide to Deploying AI Agents in Clinical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from pilot projects into routine clinical care.</description>

      <title>90% Faster, 100% Code-Free: MLLM-Driven Zero-Code 3D Game Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26161</link>

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains, including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes.

      <title>'Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description>

      <title>Human-Centered Evaluation of RAG outputs: a framework and questionnaire for human-AI collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions. Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Incentivized Exploration for Versatile Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER} (\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for \textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at https://github.com/NJU-RL/DIVER.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning Convolutions on Energy-constrained CPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work evaluates state-of-the-art convolution algorithms for CPU-based deep learning inference. While most prior studies focus on GPUs or NPUs, CPU implementations remain relatively underoptimized. We benchmark direct, GEMM-based, and Winograd convolutions across modern CPUs from ARM __ , Intel __ , AMD __ , Apple __ , and Nvidia __ , considering both latency and energy efficiency. Our results highlight the key architectural factors that govern CPU efficiency for convolution operations, providing practical guidance for energy-aware embedded deployment. As a main results of this work, the Nvidia __ AGX Orin combined with the GEMM algorithm achieves the best trade-off between inference latency and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>SlimPack: Fine-Grained Asymmetric Packing for Balanced and Efficient Variable-Length LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>ExoPredicator: Learning Abstract Models of Dynamic Worlds for Robot Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS). However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components: Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion, before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales, evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.</description>

      <title>AI Playing Business Games: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Managerial Decision-Making in Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&amp;D expense, sales forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term decision-making.</description>

      <title>SafeBehavior: Simulating Human-Like Multistage Reasoning to Mitigate Jailbreak Attacks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.</description>

      <title>How Far Do Time Series Foundation Models Paint the Landscape of Real-World Benchmarks ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</description>

      <title>Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-evolving LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ShaoShuai0605/Misevolution . Warning: this paper includes examples that may be offensive or harmful in nature.</description>

      <title>MC-GNNAS-Dock: Multi-criteria GNN-based Algorithm Selection for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge, algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system, MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters, offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third, rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.</description>

      <title>Commmunication-Efficient and Accurate Approach for Aggregation in Federated Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation (FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur \emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early \textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla \Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} = \hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication overhead.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and adaptive strategies.</description>

      <title>Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced: Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity, leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation, producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets, validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations. Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly, ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making.</description>

      <title>STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</description>

      <title>The Average Patient Fallacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages. This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes: Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many enterprises are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make internal processes more competitive and efficient. In response to public concern and new regulations for the ethical and responsible use of AI, implementing AI governance frameworks could help to integrate AI within organisations and mitigate associated risks. However, the rapid technological advances and lack of shared ethical AI infrastructures creates barriers to their practical adoption in businesses. This paper presents a real-world AI application at TVS Supply Chain Solutions, reporting on the experience developing an AI assistant underpinned by large language models and the ethical, regulatory, and sociotechnical challenges in deployment for enterprise use.</description>

      <title>Combining Knowledge Graphs and NLP to Analyze Instant Messaging Data in Criminal Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project, our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data. As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors, collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as well as promising research directions to share with the research community.</description>

      <title>OffTopicEval: When Large Language Models Enter the Wrong Chat, Almost Always!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval, an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\% -- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>SCUBA: Salesforce Computer Use Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews, spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation, data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting, open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA, while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and 16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Rearchitecting Datacenter Lifecycle for AI: A TCO-Driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally, we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches. Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter lifecycle for the future.</description>

      <title>HilbertA: Hilbert Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region. Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of $2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at $2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing baselines.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>

      <title>Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Behavioral Cloning Policies with Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.</description>

      <title>TimeRewarder: Learning Dense Reward from Passive Videos via Frame-wise Temporal Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos, including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency. Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward signals from diverse video sources.</description>

      <title>Branching Out: Broadening AI Measurement and Evaluation with Measurement Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g., agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more interpretable AI evaluation.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Addressing Pitfalls in KG-RAG Datasets: Toward More Reliable Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.</description>

      <title>FMIP: Joint Continuous-Integer Flow For Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23390v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a foundational tool for complex decision-making problems. However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics, they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP applications.</description>

      <title>AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and High-Quality Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.</description>

      <title>UML-CoT: Structured Reasoning and Planning with Unified Modeling Language for Robotic Room Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22628v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Influence: Improving the Perceptual Loss Design for Low-Dose CT Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Abstract: We introduce Devstral-Small, a lightweight open source model for code agents with the best performance among models below 100B size. In this technical report, we give an overview of how we design and develop a model and craft specializations in agentic software development. The resulting model, Devstral-Small is a small 24B model, fast and easy to serve. Despite its size, Devstral-Small still attains competitive performance compared to models more than an order of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR): APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.</description>

      <title>Towards Repository-Level Program Verification with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in code and proof generations. However, scaling automated formal verification to real-world projects requires resolving cross-module dependencies and global contexts, which are crucial challenges overlooked by existing LLM-based methods with a special focus on targeting isolated, function-level verification tasks. To systematically explore and address the significant challenges of verifying entire software repositories, we introduce RVBench, the first verification benchmark explicitly designed for repository-level evaluation, constructed from four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof synthesis for multi-module repositories. RagVerus triples proof pass rates on existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a 27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark, demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.</description>

      <title>Generating High-Quality Datasets for Code Editing via Open-Source Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However, commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1 improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4 to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Logit Sculpting: Adaptive Low-Rank Logit Transformation for Controlled Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches, such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Diagnosis and Evaluation for Robust Tabular Feature Engineering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25207</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in feature engineering for tabular data, but concerns about their reliability persist, especially due to variability in generated outputs. We introduce a multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven feature engineering in various domains.</description>

      <title>STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.</description>

      <title>Six Sigma For Neural Networks: Taguchi-based optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering, to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression. Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Condition: A Neural Heuristic for Scalable MPE Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution quality over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Linear Attention with Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net (RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation of cell</description>

      <title>FedCLF - Towards Efficient Participant Selection for Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e., FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity. Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Pattern Detection in Printhead Nozzle Logging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score for several failure mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum est in Libris: Navigating Archives with GenAI, Uncovering Tension Between Preservation and Innovation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Quantum est in libris" explores the intersection of the archaic and the modern. On one side, there are manuscript materials from the Estonian National Museum's (ERM) more than century-old archive describing the life experiences of Estonian people; on the other side, there is technology that transforms these materials into a dynamic and interactive experience. Connecting technology and cultural heritage is the visitor, who turns texts into inputs for a screen sculpture.
  Historical narratives are visually brought to life through the contemporary technological language. Because the video AI models we employed, Runway Gen-3 and Gen-4, have not previously interacted with Estonian heritage, we can observe how machines today "read the world" and create future heritage. "Quantum est in libris" introduces an exciting yet unsettling new dimension to the concept of cultural heritage: in a world where data are fluid and interpretations unstable, heritage status becomes fragile. In the digital environment, heritage issues are no longer just about preservation and transmission, but also about representation of the media, machine creativity, and interpretive error. Who or what shapes memory processes and memory spaces, and how?</description>

      <title>PALADIN: Self-Correcting Language Model Agents to Cure Tool-Failure Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose \textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution, retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR), and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57% relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%) by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in real-world tool environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering. However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics, commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Localizing Code and Non-Code Issues in Software Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited. They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations, and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects. Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic, multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at https://huggingface.co/datasets/somethingone/MULocBench.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Guided Chain-of-Draft for Token-Efficient Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps, it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose \multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency, and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of VQC for Financial Fraud Detection: A Comparative Study of Quantum Encoding Techniques and Architectural Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) configurations for financial fraud detection, encompassing three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns, circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with ZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns, achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security applications.</description>

      <title>Protocode: Prototype-Driven Interpretability for Code Generation in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering, speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric. Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can affect the performance of the model on any given task.</description>

      <title>BuildBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents on Compiling Real-World Open-Source Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital, labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task, offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields of software development and software security.</description>

      <title>BEV-VLM: Trajectory Planning via Unified BEV Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory planning.</description>

      <title>Knowledge distillation through geometry-aware representational alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.</description>

      <title>The Sandbox Configurator: A Framework to Support Technical Assessment in AI Regulatory Sandboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations; technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for trustworthy AI governance.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Powered Assessment Framework for Skill-Oriented Engineering Lab Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement, and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty, plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path to produce genuinely skilled graduates.</description>

      <title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RainfallBench-A710.</description>

      <title>From NL2SQL to NL2GeoSQL: GeoSQL-Eval for automated evaluation of LLMs on PostGIS queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation (NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions, geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis.</description>

      <title>Cognifying Education: Mapping AI's transformative role in emotional, creative, and collaborative learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice, challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt, Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support, creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving, ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Policy Induction for Adaptive Prompt Optimization: Bridging the Efficiency-Accuracy Gap via Lightweight Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs. This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function, learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.</description>

      <title>A Weather Foundation Model for the Power Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.</description>

      <title>InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.</description>

      <title>DNABERT-2: Fine-Tuning a Genomic Language Model for Colorectal Gene Enhancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.</description>

Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs), capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,} 48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last, considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets (\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge.

      <title>Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Simulating Regional Psychological Structures: An Empirical Examination of Personality and Subjective Well-being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However, systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged: while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness, with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally enriched training data and improved affective modeling.</description>

      <title>Artificial Authority: From Machine Minds to Political Alignments. An Experimental Analysis of Democratic and Autocratic Biases in Large-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies, ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded within AI systems.</description>

      <title>ClustRecNet: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Clustering Algorithm Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.</description>

      <title>A Measurement Study of Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources, promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a 14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns. Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.</description>

      <title>AI in Pakistani Schools: Adoption, Usage, and Perceived Impact among Educators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide, yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored. This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently, others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used. Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective implementation.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).</description>

      <title>Automatically Generating Web Applications from Requirements Via Multi-Agent Test-Driven Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive, demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation, including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality web applications without requiring manual intervention.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors of LLM Reinforcement Learning Post-Training: An Empirical Study in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL) post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget, larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Generative Oversampling Using an Entropy-Guided Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate. Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.</description>

      <title>VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.

      <title>From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance, Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a foundation for future work in this area.</description>

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Let Physics Guide Your Protein Flows: Topology-aware Unfolding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field. Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics, that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer sequences into precise protein conformations.</description>

      <title>Predicting Training Re-evaluation Curves Enables Effective Data Curriculums for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the *training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of *when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be *predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.</description>

      <title>SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking, the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37 state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs. We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.</description>

      <title>A Cartography of Open Collaboration in Open Source AI: Mapping Practices, Motivations, and Governance in 14 Open Large Language Model Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However, the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further. We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks, leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking to support the global community building a more open future for AI.</description>

      <title>FlashOmni: A Unified Sparse Attention Engine for Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves 2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end acceleration without degrading visual quality.</description>

      <title>From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Parameter Sharing for LLM Fine-Tuning with Multiple LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$ is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization</title>

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping. Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both expressiveness and naturalness.</description>

      <title>Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies, trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective. Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2) modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations. Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM). During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari. Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see https://github.com/Akuna23Matata/LPM_exploration</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on Joint Embedding.</description>

      <title>Multi-patch isogeometric neural solver for partial differential equations on computer-aided design domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases, namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided design models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PIPer.</description>

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real robot without using real data.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Epitope Fragments as Sufficient Target Templates for Efficient Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold, enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.</description>

      <title>Translation from Wearable PPG to 12-Lead ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations. Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.</description>

      <title>EMO-TTA: Improving Test-Time Adaptation of Audio-Language Models for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning, limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight, training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.</description>

      <title>Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools - ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a 300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%). Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers; instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate attribution rather than optimize for fluency.</description>

      <title>DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor. Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>XR Blocks: Accelerating Human-centered AI + XR Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However, a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI + XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is designed with the mission of "reducing frictions from idea to reality", thus accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype.

      <title>Economic Competition, EU Regulation, and Executive Orders: A Framework for Discussing AI Policy Implications in CS Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases, enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance, while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses. We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.</description>

      <title>LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential grounding.</description>

      <title>MixtureVitae: Open Web-Scale Pretraining Dataset With High Quality Instruction and Reasoning Data Built from Permissive-First Text Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at 130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training. Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks. These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

      <title>Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM) outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about; we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.</description>

      <title>VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end, we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection (VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone. We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines. Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances performance for less capable models.</description>

      <title>Steering an Active Learning Workflow Towards Novel Materials Discovery via Queue Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces. We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604 high-performing candidates.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image, and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Vision-Zero: Scalable VLM Self-Improvement via Strategic Gamified Self-Play</title>

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1) Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets: CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering, and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based methods. Models and code has been released at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/Vision-Zero.</description>

      <title>Aligning Multilingual Reasoning with Verifiable Semantics from a High-Resource Expert Model</title>

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference, effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions, including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically, our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly multilingual reasoning agents.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Approach for Enhancing Lesion Segmentation in Fundus Images</title>

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy, reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images, outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%, respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Stylistic Alignment in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation, benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.</description>

      <title>AttentionViG: Cross-Attention-Based Dynamic Neighbor Aggregation in Vision GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to prior vision GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical Image Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training, exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating $\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Detection of Spatiotemporal Anomalies in PMU Data Using Transformer-Based BiGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution. Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence. Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually labeled fault data.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Programming Approach for Nash Equilibrium Computation in Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games. While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous quadratically-constrained program formulation.</description>

      <title>STAC: When Innocent Tools Form Dangerous Chains to Jailbreak LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.</description>

      <title>BaB-prob: Branch and Bound with Preactivation Splitting for Probabilistic Verification of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models, respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to high-dimensional input problems.</description>

      <title>YOLO-Based Defect Detection for Metal Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.</description>

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.</description>

      <title>EEG-based AI-BCI Wheelchair Advancement: Hybrid Deep Learning with Motor Imagery for Brain Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a motor imagery right-left-hand movement mechanism for control. The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on motor imagery right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency of 200Hz. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. We propose a BiLSTM-BiGRU model that shows a superior test accuracy of 92.26% as compared with various machine learning baseline models, including XGBoost, EEGNet, and a transformer-based model. The Bi-LSTM-BiGRU attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 90.13% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.</description>

      <title>LD-MoLE: Learnable Dynamic Routing for Mixture of LoRA Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover, our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.</description>

      <title>Annotation-Efficient Active Test-Time Adaptation with Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage, a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/tingyushi/CPATTA.</description>

      <title>HNote: Extending YNote with Hexadecimal Encoding for Fine-Tuning LLMs in Music Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for symbolic music generation. However, existing formats such as MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML are either overly complex or structurally inconsistent, limiting their suitability for token-based learning architectures. To address these challenges, we propose HNote, a novel hexadecimal-based notation system extended from YNote, which encodes both pitch and duration within a fixed 32-unit measure framework. This design ensures alignment, reduces ambiguity, and is directly compatible with LLM architectures. We converted 12,300 Jiangnan-style songs generated from traditional folk pieces from YNote into HNote, and fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA. Experimental results show that HNote achieves a syntactic correctness rate of 82.5%, and BLEU and ROUGE evaluations demonstrate strong symbolic and structural similarity, producing stylistically coherent compositions. This study establishes HNote as an effective framework for integrating LLMs with cultural music modeling.</description>

      <title>DeepCodeSeek: Real-Time API Retrieval for Context-Aware Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality, end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy, allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.</description>

      <title>The AI Productivity Index (APEX)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking = On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of models' ability to produce economically valuable work.</description>

      <title>Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>Boundary-to-Region Supervision for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry: return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go (CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region. Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38 safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable, high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text generation in sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration. While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0 delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes medical AI.</description>

      <title>TruthRL: Incentivizing Truthful LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.</description>

      <title>Free Lunch Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models without Preference Image Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods, however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables "free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO.

      <title>V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Autonomy-Aware Clustering: When Local Decisions Supersede Global Prescriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.</description>

      <title>Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.</description>

      <title>Point-It-Out: Benchmarking Embodied Reasoning for Vision Language Models in Multi-Stage Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning), underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding; models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.</description>

      <title>Better with Less: Small Proprietary Models Surpass Large Language Models in Financial Transaction Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage. This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than \$13 million annual cost.</description>

      <title>CardioForest: An Explainable Ensemble Learning Model for Automatic Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia Diagnosis from ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT) from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques, i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of 94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics. SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model. Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.</description>

      <title>VELA: An LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge Approach for Evaluating Long Image Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions. Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.</description>

      <title>Overthinking Reduction with Decoupled Rewards and Curriculum Data Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2) the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising a model's underlying reasoning power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the importance of personal ownership in musical AI design, examining how practising musicians can maintain creative control over the compositional process. Through a four-week ecological evaluation, we examined how a music variation tool, reliant on the skill of musicians, functioned within a composition setting. Our findings demonstrate that the dependence of the tool on the musician's ability, to provide a strong initial musical input and to turn moments into complete musical ideas, promoted ownership of both the process and artefact. Qualitative interviews further revealed the importance of this personal ownership, highlighting tensions between technological capability and artistic identity. These findings provide insight into how musical AI can support rather than replace human creativity, highlighting the importance of designing tools that preserve the humanness of musical expression.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Large Language Models via Concrete Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference. Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B, OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.</description>

      <title>RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems, popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors, thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.</description>

      <title>S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy Decision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability of the selected features.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</description>

      <title>More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

      <title>Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning, where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions. However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and "cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.</description>

      <title>Vector sketch animation generation with differentialable motion trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods. Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the robustness and compatibility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Exploration of Sparse Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity, we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.</description>

      <title>scUnified: An AI-Ready Standardized Resource for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, and marker gene identification. To fully assess and compare these methods, standardized, analysis-ready datasets are essential. However, such datasets remain scarce, and variations in data formats, preprocessing workflows, and annotation strategies hinder reproducibility and complicate systematic evaluation of existing methods. To address these challenges, we present scUnified, an AI-ready standardized resource for single-cell RNA sequencing data that consolidates 13 high-quality datasets spanning two species (human and mouse) and nine tissue types. All datasets undergo standardized quality control and preprocessing and are stored in a uniform format to enable direct application in diverse computational analyses without additional data cleaning. We further demonstrate the utility of scUnified through experimental analyses of representative biological tasks, providing a reproducible foundation for the standardized evaluation of computational methods on a unified dataset.</description>

      <title>RoleConflictBench: A Benchmark of Role Conflict Scenarios for Evaluating LLMs' Contextual Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models.</description>

      <title>PerQ: Efficient Evaluation of Multilingual Text Personalization Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Communication Service Provision for Edge-Assisted Mobile Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices, we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service provision widely used for 5G.</description>

      <title>Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast, similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Scaling Training Data on Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.</description>

      <title>From MNIST to ImageNet: Understanding the Scalability Boundaries of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy, including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of up to 2000 classes.</description>

      <title>AIM: Adaptive Intervention for Deep Multi-task Learning of Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics. Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks. We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes. Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for multi-property molecular design.</description>

      <title>Data-Free Continual Learning of Server Models in Model-Heterogeneous Federated learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2) exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks; and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Reconcile Certified Robustness and Accuracy for DNN-based Smoothed Majority Vote Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study, we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training, we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&amp;M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&amp;M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function. Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by 228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the efficacy.</description>

      <title>VRWKV-Editor: Reducing quadratic complexity in transformer-based video editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method. However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.</description>

      <title>Learning Egocentric In-Hand Object Segmentation through Weak Supervision from Human Narrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise annotations.</description>

      <title>PFDepth: Heterogeneous Pinhole-Fisheye Joint Depth Estimation via Distortion-aware Gaussian-Splatted Volumetric Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery (undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally, fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty and valuable empirical insights.</description>

      <title>Indirect Attention: Turning Context Misalignment into a Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context (key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior ability to handle misalignment.</description>

      <title>Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.</description>

      <title>SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment. This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available at \href{https://github.com/christti98/semobridge}{github.com/christti98/semobridge}.</description>

      <title>CEAID: Benchmark of Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection Methods for Central European Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most resistant against obfuscation.</description>

      <title>Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and &gt;90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Computing Top-$k$ Simple Shortest Paths from a Single Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand, we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time, achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$ simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.</description>

Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform. Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PINN Performance Through Lie Symmetry Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents intersection of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and Lie symmetry group to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of solving partial differential equation (PDEs). Various methods have been developed to solve these equations. A Lie group is an efficient method that can lead to exact solutions for the PDEs that possessing Lie Symmetry. Leveraging the concept of infinitesimal generators from Lie symmetry group in a novel manner within PINN leads to significant improvements in solution of PDEs. In this study three distinct cases are discussed, each showing progressive improvements achieved through Lie symmetry modifications and adaptive techniques. State-of-the-art numerical methods are adopted for comparing the progressive PINN models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the key role of Lie symmetry in enhancing PINNs performance, emphasizing the importance of integrating abstract mathematical concepts into deep learning for addressing complex scientific problems adequately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Accurate Google Cloud Simulator (AGOCS) - a novel high-fidelity Cloud workload simulator based on parsing real workload traces, which can be conveniently used on a desktop machine for day-to-day research. Our simulation is based on real-world workload traces from a Google Cluster with 12.5K nodes, over a period of a calendar month. The framework is able to reveal very precise and detailed parameters of the executed jobs, tasks and nodes as well as to provide actual resource usage statistics. The system has been implemented in Scala language with focus on parallel execution and an easy-to-extend design concept. The paper presents the detailed structural framework for AGOCS and discusses our main design decisions, whilst also suggesting alternative and possibly performance enhancing future approaches. The framework is available via the Open Source GitHub repository.</description>

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through better management of simulations and combating redundancy.</description>

      <title>OWL: Geometry-Aware Spatial Reasoning for Audio Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the $\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present $\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new $\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.</description>

      <title>Bubble, Bubble, AI's Rumble: Why Global Financial Regulatory Incident Reporting is Our Shield Against Systemic Stumbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation (modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries, market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms, and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced transparency and coordinated oversight.</description>

      <title>EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting, with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling.

      <title>Towards Continual Expansion of Data Coverage: Automatic Text-guided Edge-case Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated, targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable and continuously improving AI systems.

Abstract: Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation. We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE outputs.</description>

      <title>AttriGen: Automated Multi-Attribute Annotation for Blood Cell Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute labels.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Indoor Environmental Quality in Smart Buildings Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.</description>

      <title>Toward an Unbiased Collective Memory for Efficient LLM-Based Agentic 6G Cross-Domain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model (LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases -- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i) semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii) diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies, either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines, respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving latency and energy saving distributions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Ant Colony Optimization and Google OR-Tools for Solving the Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem in Logistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable real-time logistics systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Efficient Dataset Distillation via Sparse Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets, while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/j-cyoung/GSDatasetDistillation.</description>

      <title>Type-Less yet Type-Aware Inductive Link Prediction with Pretrained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete. Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained, sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type annotations and sparse graph connectivity.

      <title>An Experimental Study on Generating Plausible Textual Explanations for Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model (LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization.</description>

      <title>3DiFACE: Synthesizing and Editing Holistic 3D Facial Animation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming, requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators. Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between high fidelity and diversity.

      <title>Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of frontier model evaluations.</description>

      <title>Finetune Once: Decoupling General &amp; Domain Learning with Dynamic Boosted Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.</description>

      <title>Point2RBox-v3: Self-Bootstrapping from Point Annotations via Integrated Pseudo-Label Refinement and Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.</description>

      <title>Representation-Based Data Quality Audits for Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data quality issues such as off-topic samples, near duplicates, and label errors often limit the performance of audio-based systems. This paper addresses these issues by adapting SelfClean, a representation-to-rank data auditing framework, from the image to the audio domain. This approach leverages self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues, creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single, unified process. The method is benchmarked on the ESC-50, GTZAN, and a proprietary industrial dataset, using both synthetic and naturally occurring corruptions. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art ranking performance, often outperforming issue-specific baselines and enabling significant annotation savings by efficiently guiding human review.</description>

      <title>Noise-Guided Transport for Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical. We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures, incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lionelblonde/ngt-pytorch.</description>

      <title>QUARTZ : QA-based Unsupervised Abstractive Refinement for Task-oriented Dialogue Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)} selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.</description>

      <title>Feedback Forensics: A Toolkit to Measure AI Personality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better" personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues, limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners, achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.</description>

      <title>EditReward: A Human-Aligned Reward Model for Instruction-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream, and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality image editing training datasets.</description>

      <title>SoK: Systematic analysis of adversarial threats against deep learning approaches for autonomous anomaly detection systems in SDN-IoT networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility. DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model, and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets. Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&amp;W and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures, including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience, interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical studies.</description>

      <title>TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem, Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description. Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Vector-Valued Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces for Neural Networks and Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains, finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces recovers the corresponding neural architectures.</description>

      <title>SDA-PLANNER: State-Dependency Aware Adaptive Planner for Embodied Task Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization, current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However, existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm, state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Transferable Agentic Knowledge Graph RAG via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</description>

However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.</description>

      <title>SeedPrints: Fingerprints Can Even Tell Which Seed Your Large Language Model Was Trained From</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.</description>

      <title>Ascent Fails to Forget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.</description>

      <title>AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.</description>

      <title>ACT: Agentic Classification Tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Planning for Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior control performance, outperforming all competitors.</description>

      <title>Attention over Scene Graphs: Indoor Scene Representations Toward CSAI Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis, such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components. This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve 81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification.

      <title>On Deepfake Voice Detection - It's All in the Presentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with higher computational demands.</description>

      <title>Regression Language Models for Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains &gt; 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves &gt; 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>VitaBench: Benchmarking LLM Agents with Versatile Interactive Tasks in Real-world Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at https://vitabench.github.io/</description>

      <title>Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.</description>

      <title>The Dragon Hatchling: The Missing Link between the Transformer and Models of the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability is essential for deploying deep learning models in symbolic music analysis, yet most research emphasizes model performance over explanation. To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.</description>

      <title>TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client. While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.</description>

      <title>OceanGym: A Benchmark Environment for Underwater Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.</description>

      <title>The Unheard Alternative: Contrastive Explanations for Speech-to-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output (the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However, obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs. Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.</description>

      <title>Parametric Neural Amp Modeling with Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp modeler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence algorithms are introduced in this work as a tool to predict the performance of new chemical compounds as alternative propellants for electric propulsion, focusing on predicting their ionisation characteristics and fragmentation patterns. The chemical properties and structure of the compounds are encoded using a chemical fingerprint, and the training datasets are extracted from the NIST WebBook. The AI-predicted ionisation energy and minimum appearance energy have a mean relative error of 6.87% and 7.99%, respectively, and a predicted ion mass with a 23.89% relative error. In the cases of full mass spectra due to electron ionisation, the predictions have a cosine similarity of 0.6395 and align with the top 10 most similar mass spectra in 78% of instances within a 30 Da range.</description>

      <title>Are Robust LLM Fingerprints Adversarially Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness} against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future fingerprinting methods.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Self-Bias in LLM-generated Translation Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks, automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed self bias.</description>

      <title>MENLO: From Preferences to Proficiency - Evaluating and Modeling Native-like Quality Across 47 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Difficult-to-Translate Test Examples at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force searching the most challenging topics.</description>

      <title>Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone, surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.</description>

      <title>OmniRetarget: Interaction-Preserving Data Generation for Humanoid Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation and Scene Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.</description>

      <title>Stitch: Training-Free Position Control in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years, but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models. We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

Abstract: In the wood industry, logs are commonly quality screened by discrete X-ray scans on a moving conveyor belt from a few source positions. Typically, the measurements are obtained in a single two-dimensional (2D) plane (a "slice") by a sequential scanning geometry. The data from each slice alone does not carry sufficient information for a three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction in which biological features of interest in the log are well preserved. In the present work, we propose a learned iterative reconstruction method based on the Learned Primal-Dual neural network, suited for sequential scanning geometries. Our method accumulates information between neighbouring slices, instead of only accounting for single slices during reconstruction. Evaluations were performed by training U-Nets on segmentation of knots (branches), which are crucial features in wood processing. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that with as few as five source positions our method yields reconstructions of logs that are sufficiently accurate to identify biological features like knots (branches), heartwood and sapwood.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic Ensembling for Multiple LLM Experts</title>

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, the strengths of LLMs can vary due to different architectures, model sizes, areas of training data, etc. Therefore, ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks. However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process, wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method uses fewer computational resources to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Collaborative Gym: A Framework for Enabling and Evaluating Human-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have sparked growing interest in developing LM agents. While fully autonomous agents could excel in many scenarios, numerous use cases inherently require them to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we present Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), a general framework enabling asynchronous, tripartite interaction among agents, humans, and task environments. We instantiate Co-Gym with three representative tasks in both simulated and real-world conditions, and propose an evaluation framework that assesses both the collaboration outcomes and processes. Our findings reveal that collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance within those delivered cases, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. However, our study also highlights significant challenges in developing collaborative agents, requiring advancements in core aspects of intelligence -- communication capabilities, situational awareness, and balancing autonomy and human control.</description>

      <title>FastCoder: Accelerating Repository-level Code Generation via Efficient Retrieval and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness. However, with the growing interest and inherent difficulty in repository-level code generation, most existing code generation studies focus on improving the correctness of generated code while overlooking the inference efficiency, which is substantially affected by the overhead during LLM generation. Although there has been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored to the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code the same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and semantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency. Consequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation tasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity and difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm, we propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the quality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, FastCoder reduces the retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that FastCoder can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%. FastCoder can also be integrated with existing correctness-focused code generation approaches to accelerate the LLM generation process, and reach a speedup exceeding 2.6x.</description>

      <title>Enabling AI Scientists to Recognize Innovation: A Domain-Agnostic Algorithm for Assessing Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), automating the generation and evaluation of novel research ideas is a key challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery. This paper presents Relative Neighbor Density (RND), a domain-agnostic algorithm for novelty assessment in research ideas that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by comparing an idea's local density with its adjacent neighbors' densities. We first developed a scalable methodology to create test set without expert labeling, addressing a fundamental challenge in novelty assessment. Using these test sets, we demonstrate that our RND algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in computer science (AUROC=0.820) and biomedical research (AUROC=0.765) domains. Most significantly, while SOTA models like Sonnet-3.7 and existing metrics show domain-specific performance degradation, RND maintains consistent accuracies across domains by its domain-invariant property, outperforming all benchmarks by a substantial margin (0.795 v.s. 0.597) on cross-domain evaluation. These results validate RND as a generalizable solution for automated novelty assessment in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Memorize or Generalize? Evaluating LLM Code Generation with Code Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities. However, there is a growing debate whether LLMs are mostly doing memorization (i.e., replicating or reusing large parts of their training data) versus generalization (i.e., beyond training data). Existing evaluations largely proxy memorization with surface/structural similarity, thereby conflating benign reuse of repeated code with harmful recall and neglecting task correctness under semantic variation. We define harmful memorization behaviorally as failure at high similarity and introduce a semantic perturbation code rewriting, which rewrites a semantically different answer at a similar difficulty level for a given coding task, then reverse-engineers a novel coding task. We further propose Memorization Risk Index (MRI), a normalized score that combines two signals: (i) how similar the model's answer for the rewritten task is to the original ground-truth solution, and (ii) how much performance drops from the original task to its rewritten counterpart. MRI is high only when both conditions hold -- when the model outputs similar code but fails the perturbed task -- thereby capturing harmful memorization rather than benign reuse of repeated code. Empirical evaluations on code generation benchmarks MBPP+ and BigCodeBench reveal that (1) memorization does not increase with larger models and in many cases alleviates as they scale; (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy while introduces memorization; (3) reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieves a more balanced trade-off between memorization and generalization.</description>

      <title>Teaching AI to Handle Exceptions: Supervised Fine-Tuning with Human-Aligned Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now evolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world contexts. Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood. This is particularly evident when testing targeted decision-making: for instance, how models handle exceptions, a critical and challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent incompleteness of contracts. Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical, suboptimal, or even counterproductive. We then evaluate three approaches to tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. We find that while ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning - specifically with human explanations - yields markedly better results. Surprisingly, in our experiments, supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of human-aligned decision-making across contexts. Furthermore, fine-tuning with explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions are made, not just which decisions are made. These findings highlight the need to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human judgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts.</description>

      <title>TAMO: Fine-Grained Root Cause Analysis via Tool-Assisted LLM Agent with Multi-Modality Observation Data in Cloud-Native Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing large language models (LLMs)-driven root cause analysis (RCA) in cloud-native systems has become a key topic of modern software operations and maintenance. However, existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: multi-modality input constraint, context window limitation, and dynamic dependence graph. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data for fine-grained RCA, namely TAMO, including multimodality alignment tool, root cause localization tool, and fault types classification tool. In detail, TAMO unifies multi-modal observation data into time-aligned representations for cross-modal feature consistency. Based on the unified representations, TAMO then invokes its specialized root cause localization tool and fault types classification tool for further identifying root cause and fault type underlying system context. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLMs in processing real-time raw observational data and dynamic service dependencies, guiding the model to generate repair strategies that align with system context through structured prompt design. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with comparable performance.</description>

      <title>AI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10468v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured, conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven and enabled by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor providing the foundation, with AI agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. We then characterize Agentic AI systems, which, in contrast to AI Agents, represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. Through a chronological evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both AI agents and agentic AI paradigms. Application domains enabled by AI Agents such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are then contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI-driven systems.</description>

Abstract: Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn, can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks. Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.</description>

      <title>R1-Code-Interpreter: LLMs Reason with Code via Supervised and Multi-stage Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical guidance on training Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage Code Interpreter across diverse tasks remains lacking. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. Unlike prior RL + tool-use efforts focused on narrow domains such as math or retrieval, we curate 144 diverse reasoning and planning tasks and show that training a general-purpose Code Interpreter across them presents significant challenges due to task heterogeneity and scarcity of effective samples. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage curriculum learning approach that partitions training samples by measured improvement potential. The RL training prioritizes samples with higher potential and gradually shifts to lower-potential ones, increasing the average RL gains from merely +3.4% to +9.3% across Qwen-2.5 models (3/7/14B). Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.1% to 72.4%, outperforming text-only GPT-4o (58.6%) and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9%). Notably, R1-CI-14B also exhibits emergent self-checking behavior through code generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/R1-Code-Interpreter and https://huggingface.co/yongchao98.</description>

      <title>VS-Bench: Evaluating VLMs for Strategic Abilities in Multi-Agent Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and textual contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic abilities in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises ten vision-grounded environments that cover cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions. The performance of VLM agents is evaluated across three dimensions: perception measured by element recognition accuracy; strategic reasoning measured by next-action prediction accuracy; and decision-making measured by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments on fifteen leading VLMs show that, although current models exhibit strong perception abilities, there remains a significant gap to optimal performance in reasoning and decision-making, with the best-performing model attaining 46.6% prediction accuracy and 31.4% normalized return. We further analyze the key factors influencing performance, conduct human experiments, and examine failure modes to provide a deeper understanding of VLMs' strategic abilities. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents. Code and data are available at https://vs-bench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Winning Gold at IMO 2025 with a Model-Agnostic Verification-and-Refinement Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is widely regarded as the world championship of high-school mathematics. IMO problems are renowned for their difficulty and novelty, demanding deep insight, creativity, and rigor. Although large language models perform well on many mathematical benchmarks, they often struggle with Olympiad-level problems. Using carefully designed prompts, we construct a model-agnostic, verification-and-refinement pipeline. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the recent IMO 2025, avoiding data contamination for models released before the competition. Equipped with any of the three leading models -- Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, or GPT-5 -- our pipeline correctly solved 5 out of the 6 problems ($\approx$85.7% accuracy). This is in sharp contrast to their baseline accuracies: 31.6% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 21.4% (Grok-4), and 38.1% (GPT-5), obtained by selecting the best of 32 candidate solutions. The substantial improvement underscores that the path to advanced AI reasoning requires not only developing more powerful base models but also designing effective methodologies to harness their full potential for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%. Codes and models are available at $\href{https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/MixGRPO}{MixGRPO}$.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent, AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark, MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results</description>

      <title>GraphCogent: Mitigating LLMs' Working Memory Constraints via Multi-Agent Collaboration in Complex Graph Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries. This phenomenon arises from LLMs' working memory constraints, which result in their inability to retain long-range graph topology over extended contexts while sustaining coherent multi-step reasoning. However, real-world graphs are often structurally complex, such as Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation networks. To address these limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and tool creation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a comprehensive benchmark that contains four domains of real-world graphs (Web, Transportation, Social, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks, categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales up to 10 times larger than existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B). Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by 20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30% for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.</description>

      <title>VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"), thereby separating the optimization problem into two stages: goal-inference and policy-synthesis. Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

      <title>Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.</description>

      <title>HealthSLM-Bench: Benchmarking Small Language Models for Mobile and Wearable Healthcare Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.</description>

      <title>$Agent^2$: An Agent-Generates-Agent Framework for Reinforcement Learning Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agent development traditionally requires substantial expertise and iterative effort, often leading to high failure rates and limited accessibility. This paper introduces Agent$^2$, an LLM-driven agent-generates-agent framework for fully automated RL agent design. Agent$^2$ autonomously translates natural language task descriptions and environment code into executable RL solutions without human intervention. The framework adopts a dual-agent architecture: a Generator Agent that analyzes tasks and designs agents, and a Target Agent that is automatically generated and executed. To better support automation, RL development is decomposed into two stages, MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, facilitating targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, Agent$^2$ provides a unified framework for standardized agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC show that Agent$^2$ outperforms manually designed baselines across all tasks, achieving up to 55\% performance improvement with consistent average gains. By enabling a closed-loop, end-to-end automation pipeline, this work advances a new paradigm in which agents can design and optimize other agents, underscoring the potential of agent-generates-agent systems for automated AI development.</description>

      <title>Is It Certainly a Deepfake? Reliability Analysis in Detection &amp; Generation Ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.</description>

      <title>GeoSketch: A Neural-Symbolic Approach to Geometric Multimodal Reasoning with Auxiliary Line Construction and Affine Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</description>

      <title>InfiAgent: Self-Evolving Pyramid Agent Framework for Infinite Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore, InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\% higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework), while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers at top-tier IEEE conferences.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.</description>

      <title>Risk Profiling and Modulation for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.</description>

      <title>SysMoBench: Evaluating AI on Formally Modeling Complex Real-World Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages. We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and opening up promising new research directions.</description>

      <title>MathBode: Frequency-Domain Fingerprints of LLM Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.

      <title>Toward Effective Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Self-Evolved Preference Learning</title>

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools. However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately, while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately. Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach, comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in executing TIR tasks.</description>

      <title>Accurate Predictions in Education with Discrete Variational Inference</title>

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation baselines.</description>

      <title>Model Merging Scaling Laws in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward AGI-level systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However, traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline, representing a 12.2% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare communication optimization.</description>

      <title>Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompts and Heuristics for Automatic Algorithm Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Ambiguity to Verdict: A Semiotic-Grounded Multi-Perspective Agent for LLM Logical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.</description>

      <title>Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.</description>

      <title>MASLegalBench: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Systems in Deductive Legal Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>

      <title>A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art multi-objective optimization often assumes a known utility function, learns it interactively, or computes the full Pareto front-each requiring costly expert input.~Real-world problems, however, involve implicit preferences that are hard to formalize. To reduce expert involvement, we propose an offline, interpretable utility learning method that uses expert knowledge, historical examples, and coarse information about the utility space to reduce sample requirements. We model uncertainty via a full Bayesian posterior and propagate it throughout the optimization process. Our method outperforms standard Gaussian processes and BOPE across four domains, showing strong performance even with biased samples, as encountered in the real-world, and limited expert input.</description>

      <title>Medical Question Summarization with Entity-driven Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By summarizing longer consumer health questions into shorter and essential ones, medical question-answering systems can more accurately understand consumer intentions and retrieve suitable answers. However, medical question summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble descriptions from patients and doctors. Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address the medical question summarization (MQS) task, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework based on entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities present in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach compels models to focus on essential information and consequently generate more accurate question summaries. Furthermore, we have discovered that some MQS datasets, such as the iCliniq dataset with a 33% duplicate rate, have significant data leakage issues. To ensure an impartial evaluation of the related methods, this paper carefully examines leaked samples to reorganize more reasonable datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ECL method outperforms the existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 52.85, 43.16, 41.31, 43.52 in terms of ROUGE-1 metric on MeQSum, CHQ-Summ, iCliniq, HealthCareMagic dataset, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2304.11127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent scientific advances require complex experiment design, necessitating the meticulous tuning of many experiment parameters. Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a widely used Bayesian optimization method in recent parameter tuning frameworks such as Hyperopt and Optuna. Despite its popularity, the roles of each control parameter in TPE and the algorithm intuition have not been discussed so far. The goal of this paper is to identify the roles of each control parameter and their impacts on parameter tuning based on the ablation studies using diverse benchmark datasets. The recommended setting concluded from the ablation studies is demonstrated to improve the performance of TPE. Our TPE implementation used in this paper is available at https://github.com/nabenabe0928/tpe/tree/single-opt.</description>

      <title>Fast Exact Unlearning for In-Context Learning Data for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are expensive to train, and there is a growing concern about the challenge of retroactively removing specific training data. Achieving exact unlearning in deep learning pipelines--producing models as if certain data had never been included in training--remains an open problem. In this paper, we revisit exact unlearning in deep learning and show that for large language models (LLMs) we can efficiently exactly unlearn "fine-tuning data" (the data used to adapt a pre-trained model). This follows from two observations. First, we can use in-context learning to adapt the LLM to the fine-tuning dataset instead of SGD based algorithms. Second, we show that accurate in-context learning can be done with quantized k-means, which allows for effectively constant time unlearning operations. Our evaluation shows that this unlearning recipe has similar performance to fine-tuning alternatives, but vastly reduces the unlearning costs. Our study also highlights the need for new measures of unlearning cost when adapting the learning algorithm to have faster unlearn operations.</description>

      <title>scCDCG: Efficient Deep Structural Clustering for single-cell RNA-seq via Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis.

      <title>Bird Eye-View to Street-View: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, street view imagery has grown to become one of the most important sources of geospatial data collection and urban analytics, which facilitates generating meaningful insights and assisting in decision-making. Synthesizing a street-view image from its corresponding satellite image is a challenging task due to the significant differences in appearance and viewpoint between the two domains. In this study, we screened 20 recent research papers to provide a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of how street-view images are synthesized from their corresponding satellite counterparts. The main findings are: (i) novel deep learning techniques are required for synthesizing more realistic and accurate street-view images; (ii) more datasets need to be collected for public usage; and (iii) more specific evaluation metrics need to be investigated for evaluating the generated images appropriately. We conclude that, due to applying outdated deep learning techniques, the recent literature failed to generate detailed and diverse street-view images.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Hybrids with MAD Skills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently proposed hybrid architectures seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose Manticore, a framework that addresses these challenges by automating the design of hybrid architectures while reusing pretrained models to create pretrained hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to program pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids match existing manually designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena, and improve on pretrained transformers and state space models on various natural language tasks.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.</description>

      <title>Investigating Long-term Training for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous methods have achieved impressive performance in remote sensing object detection, relying on convolution or transformer architectures. Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. A common practice in current detectors is initializing the backbone with pre-trained weights available online. Fine-tuning the backbone is typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance. In this study, we aim to investigate the performance and characteristics of remote sensing object detection models under very long training schedules, and propose a novel method named Dynamic Backbone Freezing (DBF) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection under long-term training. Our method addresses the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to manage the update of backbone features during long-term training dynamically. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that our approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing computational costs in long-term training. Besides, it can be seamlessly adopted without additional effort due to its straightforward design. The code is available at https://github.com/unique-chan/dbf.</description>

      <title>The Quest for the Right Mediator: Surveying Mechanistic Interpretability Through the Lens of Causal Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretability provides a toolset for understanding how and why neural networks behave in certain ways. However, there is little unity in the field: most studies employ ad-hoc evaluations and do not share theoretical foundations, making it difficult to measure progress and compare the pros and cons of different techniques. Furthermore, while mechanistic understanding is frequently discussed, the basic causal units underlying these mechanisms are often not explicitly defined. In this article, we propose a perspective on interpretability research grounded in causal mediation analysis. Specifically, we describe the history and current state of interpretability taxonomized according to the types of causal units (mediators) employed, as well as methods used to search over mediators. We discuss the pros and cons of each mediator, providing insights as to when particular kinds of mediators and search methods are most appropriate. We argue that this framing yields a more cohesive narrative of the field and helps researchers select appropriate methods based on their research objective. Our analysis yields actionable recommendations for future work, including the discovery of new mediators and the development of standardized evaluations tailored to these goals.</description>

      <title>SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Solutions to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables \emph{analytical} construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGS (\emph{\underline{Co}mposing \underline{G}lobal \underline{S}olutions}). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of \emph{sum potentials}, which are ring homomorphisms, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global solutions constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global solutions such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.

      <title>FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that effectively addresses periodicity modeling challenges while offering broad applicability similar to MLP with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but face challenges in scaling to deeper networks and are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach overcomes this challenge to enable scaling to large-scale models and maintains general-purpose modeling capability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks. Moreover, we reveal that compared to existing Fourier-based networks, FAN accommodates both periodicity modeling and general-purpose modeling well.</description>

      <title>pEBR: A Probabilistic Approach to Embedding Based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding retrieval systems learn a shared semantic representation space for queries and items, enabling efficient retrieval through an approximate nearest-neighbor search. However, current industrial implementations face a critical limitation: using a fixed retrieval cutoff for all queries inevitably compromises performance, yielding insufficient recall for high-frequency (head) queries and reduced precision for low-frequency (tail) queries. This persistent challenge stems fundamentally from the frequentist paradigms dominating existing loss function designs.
  In this work, we introduce a novel framework, probabilistic Embedding-Based Retrieval (\textbf{pEBR}):
  maximum likelihood estimation-based and contrastive estimation-based, which learns the underlying probability distribution of relevant items for each query, compute adaptive cosine similarity cutoffs via probabilistic cumulative distribution functions (CDF), and automatically adapts to the distinct characteristics of head vs. tail queries.
  Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pEBR simultaneously improves precision and recall while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Transfer Learning for Open-World Few-Shot Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.</description>

      <title>BianCang: A Traditional Chinese Medicine Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge of large language models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in medical applications, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, current medical LLMs struggle with TCM diagnosis and syndrome differentiation due to substantial differences between TCM and modern medical theory, and the scarcity of specialized, high-quality corpora. To this end, in this paper we propose BianCang, a TCM-specific LLM, using a two-stage training process that first injects domain-specific knowledge and then aligns it through targeted stimulation to enhance diagnostic and differentiation capabilities. Specifically, we constructed pre-training corpora, instruction-aligned datasets based on real hospital records, and the ChP-TCM dataset derived from the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. We compiled extensive TCM and medical corpora for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, building a comprehensive dataset to refine the model's understanding of TCM. Evaluations across 11 test sets involving 31 models and 4 tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BianCang, offering valuable insights for future research. Code, datasets, and models are available on https://github.com/QLU-NLP/BianCang.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Association Rules from Internet of Things Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in High-Speed Railways Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical challenge in the high-speed passenger railway industry: designing effective dynamic pricing strategies in the context of competing and cooperating operators. To address this, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on a non-zero-sum Markov game is proposed, incorporating random utility models to capture passenger decision making. Unlike prior studies in areas such as energy, airlines, and mobile networks, dynamic pricing for railway systems using deep reinforcement learning has received limited attention. A key contribution of this paper is a parametrisable and versatile reinforcement learning simulator designed to model a variety of railway network configurations and demand patterns while enabling realistic, microscopic modelling of user behaviour, called RailPricing-RL. This environment supports the proposed MARL framework, which models heterogeneous agents competing to maximise individual profits while fostering cooperative behaviour to synchronise connecting services. Experimental results validate the framework, demonstrating how user preferences affect MARL performance and how pricing policies influence passenger choices, utility, and overall system dynamics. This study provides a foundation for advancing dynamic pricing strategies in railway systems, aligning profitability with system-wide efficiency, and supporting future research on optimising pricing policies.</description>

      <title>Dagger Behind Smile: Fool LLMs with a Happy Ending Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from $\textit{jailbreak}$ attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious contents. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request. This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.</description>

      <title>A space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Mind the Value-Action Gap: Do LLMs Act in Alignment with Their Values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing research primarily evaluates the values of LLMs by examining their stated inclinations towards specific values. However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.</description>

      <title>CE-SDWV: Effective and Efficient Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via a Semantic-Driven Word Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative performance about various concepts. With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/TtuHamg/CE-SDWV.</description>

      <title>LFTR: Learning-Free Token Reduction for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in various multimodal tasks, yet their deployment is frequently limited by substantial computational demands and prolonged inference times. Given that the vision modality typically contains more comprehensive information than the text modality, resulting in encoded representations comprising an extensive number of tokens, leading to significant computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism. Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting. Additionally, LFTR is complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as vision encoder compression and post-training quantization, further promoting the efficient deployment of MLLMs. Our project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LFTR-AAAI-0528.</description>

      <title>Should You Use Your Large Language Model to Explore or Exploit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the ability of the current generation of large language models (LLMs) to help a decision-making agent facing an exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We use LLMs to explore and exploit in silos in various (contextual) bandit tasks. We find that while the current LLMs often struggle to exploit, in-context mitigations may be used to substantially improve performance for small-scale tasks. However even then, LLMs perform worse than a simple linear regression. On the other hand, we find that LLMs do help at exploring large action spaces with inherent semantics, by suggesting suitable candidates to explore.</description>

      <title>Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization for Offline Model-based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning agents face significant deployment challenges due to the synthetic-to-real distribution mismatch. While most prior research has focused on improving the fidelity of synthetic sampling and incorporating off-policy mechanisms, the directly integrated paradigm often fails to ensure consistent policy behavior in biased models and underlying environmental dynamics, which inherently arise from discrepancies between behavior and learning policies. In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DAMO effectively ensures model and policy alignments, achieving competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>iVISPAR -- An Interactive Visual-Spatial Reasoning Benchmark for VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are known to struggle with spatial reasoning and visual alignment. To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. \mbox{iVISPAR} is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle, a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website: https://microcosm.ai/ivispar</description>

      <title>Towards Reasoning Ability of Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. This paper introduces ThinkSLM, the first extensive benchmark to systematically evaluate and study the reasoning abilities of SLMs trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. We first establish a reliable evaluation criterion comparing available methods and LLM judges against our human evaluations. Then we present a study evaluating 72 diverse SLMs from six major model families across 17 reasoning benchmarks. We repeat all our experiments three times to ensure a robust assessment. Our findings show that: 1) reasoning ability in SLMs is strongly influenced by training methods and data quality rather than solely model scale; 2) quantization preserves reasoning capability, while pruning significantly disrupts it; 3) larger models consistently exhibit higher robustness against adversarial perturbations and intermediate reasoning, but certain smaller models closely match or exceed the larger models' performance. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression.

      <title>Solving the Cold Start Problem on One's Own as an End User via Preference Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach that enables end users to directly solve the cold start problem by themselves. The cold start problem is a common issue in recommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to address the problem on the service provider's side. However, when the service provider does not take action, users are left with poor recommendations and no means to improve their experience. We propose an algorithm, Pretender, that allows end users to proactively solve the cold start problem on their own. Pretender does not require any special support from the service provider and can be deployed independently by users. We formulate the problem as minimizing the distance between the source and target distributions and optimize item selection from the target service accordingly. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees for Pretender based on a discrete quadrature problem. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pretender.</description>

      <title>Linear Attention for Efficient Bidirectional Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Transformers and State Space Models have emerged as efficient alternatives to softmax Transformers for causal sequence modeling, enabling parallel training via matrix multiplication and efficient RNN-style inference. However, despite their success in causal tasks, no unified framework exists for applying Linear Transformers to bidirectional sequence modeling. We introduce LION, the first framework to systematically extend Linear Transformers to the bidirectional setting. LION generalizes three core representations commonly used in the causal case - full Linear Attention , bidirectional RNN, and chunkwise parallel form - to the bidirectional setting. These forms are theoretically equivalent and enable models to exploit the strengths of each during training and inference. We prove that a broad class of Linear Transformers can be extended using LION and validate our framework via three core examples based on the choice of decay type: LION-LIT, the bidirectional extension of arXiv:2006.16236; LION-D, based on arXiv:2307.08621; and LION-S, a variant using selective decay arXiv:2103.02143, arXiv:2312.0075. Across standard bidirectional tasks, LION enables models to match or exceed the performance of softmax Transformers, while offering significantly faster training and more efficient inference than existing State Space Models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Large Langauge Model Benchmarks against Data Contamination: From Static to Dynamic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data contamination has received increasing attention in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to their reliance on vast Internet-derived training corpora. To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap-the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts. We maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link.</description>

      <title>Voting or Consensus? Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.</description>

      <title>FANformer: Improving Large Language Models Through Effective Periodicity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21309</link>

Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which adapts Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. Our pretrained FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. Moreover, we reveal that FANformer exhibits superior ability to learn and apply rules for reasoning compared to Transformer. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.</description>

      <title>Answer, Refuse, or Guess? Investigating Risk-Aware Decision Making in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used to build agents that can act autonomously to achieve goals. During this automatic process, agents need to take a series of actions, some of which might lead to severe consequences if incorrect actions are taken. Therefore, such agents must sometimes defer-refusing to act when their confidence is insufficient-to avoid the potential cost of incorrect actions. Because the severity of consequences varies across applications, the tendency to defer should also vary: in low-risk settings agents should answer more freely, while in high-risk settings their decisions should be more conservative. We study this "answer-or-defer" problem with an evaluation framework that systematically varies human-specified risk structures-rewards and penalties for correct answers, incorrect answers, and refusals $(r_{\mathrm{cor}},r_{\mathrm{inc}}, r_{\mathrm{ref}})$-while keeping tasks fixed. This design evaluates LMs' risk-aware decision policies by measuring their ability to maximize expected reward. Across multiple datasets and models, we identify flaws in their decision policies: LMs tend to over-answer in high-risk settings and over-defer in low-risk settings. After analyzing the potential cause of such flaws, we find that a simple skill-decomposition method, which isolates the independent skills required for answer-or-defer decision making, can consistently improve LMs' decision policies. Our results highlight the current limitations of LMs in risk-conditioned decision making and provide practical guidance for deploying more reliable LM-based agents across applications of varying risk levels.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Balance Packing: Towards Efficient Supervised Fine-tuning for Long-Context LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue, but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MoE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/HBP.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical quantities of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? We argue not, based on the following observations: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the fitting target of the diffusion model's objective function degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample, which we believe hinders the model's ability to effectively learn essential statistical quantities such as posterior, score, or velocity field. 2) Most inference methods can be unified within a simple framework which involves no statistical concepts, aligns with the degraded objective function, and provides an novel and intuitive perspective on the inference process.</description>

      <title>Revisiting semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship classification. This survey comprehensively analyzes the diverse DL techniques employed in this domain. We identify critical trends and challenges, highlighting the importance of integrating handcrafted features, utilizing public datasets, data augmentation, fine-tuning, explainability techniques, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to improve DL model performance. This survey establishes a first-of-its-kind taxonomy for categorizing relevant research based on DL models, handcrafted feature use, SAR attribute utilization, and the impact of fine-tuning. We discuss the methodologies used in SAR ship classification tasks and the impact of different techniques. Finally, the survey explores potential avenues for future research, including addressing data scarcity, exploring novel DL architectures, incorporating interpretability techniques, and establishing standardized performance metrics. By addressing these challenges and leveraging advancements in DL, researchers can contribute to developing more accurate and efficient ship classification systems, ultimately enhancing maritime surveillance and related applications.</description>

      <title>FW-Merging: Scaling Model Merging with Frank-Wolfe Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for multi-task learning (MTL), offering a data-efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning. However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models. Our code is open-sourced at github.com/hmarkc/FW-Merging.</description>

      <title>Value Profiles for Encoding Human Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using natural language value profiles -- descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model that estimates individual ratings from a rater representation. To measure the predictive information in a rater representation, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology and find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles, then demographics. However, value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (&gt;70% information preservation) and offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability. Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder predictions change in line with semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.</description>

      <title>CODA: Repurposing Continuous VAEs for Discrete Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete visual tokenizers transform images into a sequence of tokens, enabling token-based visual generation akin to language models. However, this process is inherently challenging, as it requires both compressing visual signals into a compact representation and discretizing them into a fixed set of codes. Traditional discrete tokenizers typically learn the two tasks jointly, often leading to unstable training, low codebook utilization, and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CODA}(\textbf{CO}ntinuous-to-\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}daptation), a framework that decouples compression and discretization. Instead of training discrete tokenizers from scratch, CODA adapts off-the-shelf continuous VAEs -- already optimized for perceptual compression -- into discrete tokenizers via a carefully designed discretization process. By primarily focusing on discretization, CODA ensures stable and efficient training while retaining the strong visual fidelity of continuous VAEs. Empirically, with $\mathbf{6 \times}$ less training budget than standard VQGAN, our approach achieves a remarkable codebook utilization of 100% and notable reconstruction FID (rFID) of $\mathbf{0.43}$ and $\mathbf{1.34}$ for $8 \times$ and $16 \times$ compression on ImageNet 256$\times$ 256 benchmark.</description>

      <title>Enabling Rapid Shared Human-AI Mental Model Alignment via the After-Action Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two novel contributions toward improving research in human-machine teaming (HMT): 1) a Minecraft testbed to accelerate testing and deployment of collaborative AI agents and 2) a tool to allow users to revisit and analyze behaviors within an HMT episode to facilitate shared mental model development. Our browser-based Minecraft testbed allows for rapid testing of collaborative agents in a continuous-space, real-time, partially-observable environment with real humans without cumbersome setup typical to human-AI interaction user studies. As Minecraft has an extensive player base and a rich ecosystem of pre-built AI agents, we hope this contribution can help to facilitate research quickly in the design of new collaborative agents and in understanding different human factors within HMT. Our mental model alignment tool facilitates user-led post-mission analysis by including video displays of first-person perspectives of the team members (i.e., the human and AI) that can be replayed, and a chat interface that leverages GPT-4 to provide answers to various queries regarding the AI's experiences and model details.</description>

      <title>Lobster: A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Neurosymbolic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component and a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs.
  We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by apm allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes.
  We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 9 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 3.9x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chains of thought (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicates that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</description>

      <title>Fair Uncertainty Quantification for Depression Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Layer-wise Learning: Scalable and Efficient Alternative to Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation underpins modern deep learning, yet its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and incurs high memory costs. In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations.</description>

      <title>Simple yet Effective Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation from Vision-Language Models via Dual-Head Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity challenges by leveraging unlabeled data. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs), pre-trained on massive image-text pairs, have demonstrated remarkable zero-/few-shot performance that often surpasses SSL approaches due to their exceptional generalization capabilities. This gap motivates us to question: how can we effectively harness the powerful generalization capabilities of VLMs into task-specific models? Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a natural framework for transferring VLM capabilities, but we identify that it suffers from gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation losses. To address this challenge, we propose Dual-Head Optimization (DHO), which introduces dual prediction heads for each distinct signal. We observe that DHO resolves gradient conflicts, enabling improved feature learning compared to single-head KD baselines, with practical benefits of minimal computational overhead and test-time hyperparameter tuning without retraining. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets show that DHO consistently outperforms KD baselines, often outperforming teacher models with smaller student models. DHO also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution ImageNet semi-supervised learning and out-of-distribution generalization across ImageNet variants. We publicly release our code and model checkpoints to facilitate future research at https://github.com/erjui/DHO.</description>

      <title>Scalable LLM Math Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (&gt;16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).</description>

      <title>TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for improved quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, an improved framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98$\%$, and can achieve 50$\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $&lt;$1$\%$ rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.</description>

      <title>Modeling Saliency Dataset Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around 40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark (MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine both absolute and relative sizes.</description>

      <title>DisCO: Reinforcing Large Reasoning Models with Discriminative Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.</description>

      <title>scSiameseClu: A Siamese Clustering Framework for Interpreting single-cell RNA Sequencing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Structured Agent Distillation for Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into {[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable agents.</description>

      <title>ELEPHANT: Measuring and understanding social sycophancy in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are known to exhibit sycophancy: agreeing with and flattering users, even at the cost of correctness. Prior work measures sycophancy only as direct agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs that can be compared to a ground truth. This fails to capture broader forms of sycophancy such as affirming a user's self-image or other implicit beliefs. To address this gap, we introduce social sycophancy, characterizing sycophancy as excessive preservation of a user's face (their desired self-image), and present ELEPHANT, a benchmark for measuring social sycophancy in an LLM. Applying our benchmark to 11 models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates of social sycophancy: on average, they preserve user's face 45 percentage points more than humans in general advice queries and in queries describing clear user wrongdoing (from Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole). Furthermore, when prompted with perspectives from either side of a moral conflict, LLMs affirm both sides (depending on whichever side the user adopts) in 48% of cases--telling both the at-fault party and the wronged party that they are not wrong--rather than adhering to a consistent moral or value judgment. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in preference datasets, and that while existing mitigation strategies for sycophancy are limited in effectiveness, model-based steering shows promise for mitigating these behaviors. Our work provides theoretical grounding and an empirical benchmark for understanding and addressing sycophancy in the open-ended contexts that characterize the vast majority of LLM use cases.</description>

      <title>Silent Leaks: Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack on RAG Systems through Benign Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but this may expose them to extraction attacks, leading to potential copyright and privacy risks. However, existing extraction methods typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking, making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts Knowledge Extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. Specifically, IKEA first leverages anchor concepts-keywords related to internal knowledge-to generate queries with a natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms that lead anchor concepts to thoroughly "explore" the RAG's knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response histories, ensuring their relevance to the topic; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute RAG system built from IKEA's extractions shows comparable performance to the original RAG and outperforms those based on baselines across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the stealthy copyright infringement risk in RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Octic Vision Transformers: Quicker ViTs Through Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15441v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>DEBATE, TRAIN, EVOLVE: Self Evolution of Language Model Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on seven reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities. Our framework code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/Debate-Train-Evolve</description>

      <title>Causal Interventions Reveal Shared Structure Across English Filler-Gap Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that causal interpretability methods, applied to LMs, can greatly enhance the value of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LMs learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler--gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LMs can push linguistic theory forward.</description>

      <title>AudioTrust: Benchmarking the Multifaceted Trustworthiness of Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have gained widespread adoption, yet their trustworthiness remains underexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks, designed primarily for text, fail to address unique vulnerabilities introduced by audio's acoustic properties. We identify significant trustworthiness risks in ALLMs arising from non-semantic acoustic cues, including timbre, accent, and background noise, which can manipulate model behavior. We propose AudioTrust, a comprehensive framework for systematic evaluation of ALLM trustworthiness across audio-specific risks. AudioTrust encompasses six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. The framework implements 26 distinct sub-tasks using a curated dataset of over 4,420 audio samples from real-world scenarios, including daily conversations, emergency calls, and voice assistant interactions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 18 experimental configurations using human-validated automated pipelines. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs reveals significant limitations when confronted with diverse high-risk audio scenarios, providing insights for secure deployment of audio models. Code and data are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.</description>

      <title>Find the Fruit: Zero-Shot Sim2Real RL for Occlusion-Aware Plant Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous harvesting in the open presents a complex manipulation problem. In most scenarios, an autonomous system has to deal with significant occlusion and require interaction in the presence of large structural uncertainties (every plant is different). Perceptual and modeling uncertainty make design of reliable manipulation controllers for harvesting challenging, resulting in poor performance during deployment. We present a sim2real reinforcement learning (RL) framework for occlusion-aware plant manipulation, where a policy is learned entirely in simulation to reposition stems and leaves to reveal target fruit(s). In our proposed approach, we decouple high-level kinematic planning from low-level compliant control which simplifies the sim2real transfer. This decomposition allows the learned policy to generalize across multiple plants with different stiffness and morphology. In experiments with multiple real-world plant setups, our system achieves up to 86.7% success in exposing target fruits, demonstrating robustness to occlusion variation and structural uncertainty.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Interactive Exploration of Historical Cadastre Data: Framework and Application to Venice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cadastral data reveal key information about the historical organization of cities but are often non-standardized due to diverse formats and human annotations, complicating large-scale analysis. We explore as a case study Venice's urban history during the critical period from 1740 to 1808, capturing the transition following the fall of the ancient Republic and the Ancien R\'egime. This era's complex cadastral data, marked by its volume and lack of uniform structure, presents unique challenges that our approach adeptly navigates, enabling us to generate spatial queries that bridge past and present urban landscapes. We present a text-to-programs framework that leverages Large Language Models (\llms) to process natural language queries as executable code for analyzing historical cadastral records. Our methodology implements two complementary techniques: a SQL agent for handling structured queries about specific cadastral information, and a coding agent for complex analytical operations requiring custom data manipulation. We propose a taxonomy that classifies historical research questions based on their complexity and analytical requirements, mapping them to the most appropriate technical approach. This framework is supported by an investigation into the execution consistency of the system, alongside a qualitative analysis of the answers it produces. By ensuring interpretability and minimizing hallucination through verifiable program outputs, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in reconstructing past population information, property features, and spatiotemporal comparisons in Venice.</description>

      <title>Value-Guided Search for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step," which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods such as majority voting or best-of-n. Moreover, VGS significantly reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>SelfReflect: Can LLMs Communicate Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Linear Temporal Difference Learning with Arbitrary Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.</description>

      <title>ViewSpatial-Bench: Evaluating Multi-perspective Spatial Localization in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</description>

      <title>Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning with Differentiable Auxiliary Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on graph-structured data typically faces non-IID challenges, particularly in scenarios where each client holds a distinct subgraph sampled from a global graph. In this paper, we introduce Federated learning with Auxiliary projections (FedAux), a personalized subgraph FL framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and personalization performance.

      <title>WorldGym: World Model as An Environment for Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating robot control policies is difficult: real-world testing is costly, and handcrafted simulators require manual effort to improve in realism and generality. We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</description>

      <title>Multi Layered Autonomy and AI Ecologies in Robotic Art Installations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Symbiosis of Agents, is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen (baoyangchen.com), that embeds AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in contemporary art.</description>

      <title>Negative-Guided Subject Fidelity Optimization for Zero-Shot Subject-Driven Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject fidelity. Existing supervised fine-tuning methods, which rely only on positive targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, often fail to capture fine-grained subject details. To address this, SFO introduces additional synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically produces synthetic negatives tailored for subject-driven generation by introducing controlled degradations that emphasize subject fidelity and text alignment without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus fine-tuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms recent strong baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

      <title>Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even surpasses a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on a text embedding benchmark. Lastly, we perform a variety of analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding components that are not highly relevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.</description>

      <title>Resisting Contextual Interference in RAG via Parametric-Knowledge Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but can be derailed by wrong, irrelevant, or conflicting retrieved text, causing models to rely on inaccurate evidence and cascade errors. We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that \method significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by 23% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</description>

      <title>Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs) both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering (QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem: fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence. Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA, where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks, Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models, highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient and accurate QA.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for self-supervised contrastive learning for continuous dependent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.</description>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.</description>

      <title>QGuard:Question-based Zero-shot Guard for Multi-modal LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12299</link>

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance for Counterfactual Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual generation aims to simulate realistic hypothetical outcomes under causal interventions. Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation and classifier-free guidance (CFG). In this work, we identify a key limitation of CFG for counterfactual generation: it prescribes a global guidance scale for all attributes, leading to significant spurious changes in inferred counterfactuals. To mitigate this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic guidance technique that enables attribute-wise control following a causal graph. DCFG is implemented via a simple attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups.</description>

      <title>FeDa4Fair: Client-Level Federated Datasets for Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, the diverse and often conflicting biases present across clients pose significant challenges to model fairness. Current fairness-enhancing FL solutions often fall short, as they typically mitigate biases for a single, usually binary, sensitive attribute, while ignoring the heterogeneous fairness needs that exist in real-world settings. Moreover, these solutions often evaluate unfairness reduction only on the server side, hiding persistent unfairness at the individual client level. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework for fairness-aware FL at both the global and client levels. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We introduce \fairdataset, a library to create tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.</description>

      <title>When Does Multimodality Lead to Better Time Series Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition.</description>

      <title>SoMi-ToM: Evaluating Multi-Perspective Theory of Mind in Embodied Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Graph Learning for Industrial Carbon Emission Analysis and Policy Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial carbon emissions are a major driver of climate change, yet modeling these emissions is challenging due to multicollinearity among factors and complex interdependencies across sectors and time. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.</description>

      <title>LATTE: Latent Trajectory Embedding for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This erodes trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generated image detectors that remain reliable across different generators. While recent approaches leverage diffusion denoising cues, they typically rely on single-step reconstruction errors and overlook the sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose LATTE - LATent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the evolution of latent embeddings across multiple denoising steps. Instead of treating each denoising step in isolation, LATTE captures the trajectory of these representations, revealing subtle and discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated images. Experiments on several benchmarks, such as GenImage, Chameleon, and Diffusion Forensics, show that LATTE achieves superior performance, especially in challenging cross-generator and cross-dataset scenarios, highlighting the potential of latent trajectory modeling. The code is available on the following link: https://github.com/AnaMVasilcoiu/LATTE-Diffusion-Detector.</description>

      <title>HumanVideo-MME: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Methods and Metrics for Explainable AI in Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories (faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast, robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods, metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.</description>

      <title>Scaling RL to Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).</description>

      <title>CADmium: Fine-Tuning Code Language Models for Text-Driven Sequential CAD Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.</description>

      <title>QuestA: Expanding Reasoning Capacity in LLMs via Question Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks. Yet recent studies question RL's ability to incentivize reasoning capacity beyond the base model. This raises a key challenge: how can RL be adapted to solve harder reasoning problems more effectively? To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 72.50% (+10.73%) on AIME24, 62.29% (+12.79%) on AIME25, and 41.67% (+10.11%) on HMMT25.

      <title>Linguistic and Embedding-Based Profiling of Texts generated by Humans and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written or machine-generated texts, our study focuses on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality, and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls, and model release dates. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human- and machine-generated texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with human-written texts displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to a homogenization of machine-generated texts.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: A Review of Arabic Post-Training Datasets and Their Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., Persona and System Prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., Cultural, Safety, Ethics, and Fairness); and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic-centric LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in Arabic post-training dataset development.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Language Mixing on Bilingual LLM Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing-alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.</description>

      <title>The Ever-Evolving Science Exam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As foundation models grow rapidly in capability and deployment, evaluating their scientific understanding becomes increasingly critical. Existing science benchmarks have made progress towards broad Range, wide Reach, and high Rigor, yet they often face two major challenges: data leakage risks that compromise benchmarking validity, and evaluation inefficiency due to large-scale testing. To address these issues, we introduce the Ever-Evolving Science Exam (EESE), a dynamic benchmark designed to reliably assess scientific capabilities in foundation models. Our approach consists of two components: 1) a non-public EESE-Pool with over 100K expertly constructed science instances (question-answer pairs) across 5 disciplines and 500+ subfields, built through a multi-stage pipeline ensuring Range, Reach, and Rigor, 2) a periodically updated 500-instance subset EESE, sampled and validated to enable leakage-resilient, low-overhead evaluations. Experiments on 32 open- and closed-source models demonstrate that EESE effectively differentiates the strengths and weaknesses of models in scientific fields and cognitive dimensions. Overall, EESE provides a robust, scalable, and forward-compatible solution for science benchmark design, offering a realistic measure of how well foundation models handle science questions.

      <title>A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</description>

      <title>Learning Unified User Quantized Tokenizers for User Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, we use the Qwen3 Embedding model to derive a compact yet expressive feature representation; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.</description>

      <title>FoundBioNet: A Foundation-Based Model for IDH Genotyping of Glioma from Multi-Parametric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity. While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets. Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming baseline approaches (p &lt;= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized patient care.</description>

      <title>The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find that (and explain why) the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969 based on the structure of most known nuclear ground states. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses based on physics deduced by AI.</description>

      <title>Image-Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splat Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks. This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating. Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability, contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

      <title>Learning to Generate Unit Test via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models (LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</description>

      <title>Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-BIND-T: Improved and Temporally Consistent Sensor Modality Translation and Fusion for Robotic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</description>

      <title>Ban&amp;Pick: Ehancing Performance and Efficiency of MoE-LLMs via Smarter Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency at inference. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&amp;Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban further dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban\&amp;Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the vLLM.</description>

      <title>Inducing Uncertainty on Open-Weight Models for Test-Time Privacy in Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key concern for AI safety remains understudied in the machine learning (ML) literature: how can we ensure users of ML models do not leverage predictions on incorrect personal data to harm others? This is particularly pertinent given the rise of open-weight models, where simply masking model outputs does not suffice to prevent adversaries from recovering harmful predictions. To address this threat, which we call *test-time privacy*, we induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on all other instances. Our proposed algorithm uses a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains at least $&gt;3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with marginal drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.</description>

      <title>MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.</description>

      <title>U-Mamba2: Scaling State Space Models for Dental Anatomy Segmentation in CBCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing first place in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.84, HD95 of 38.17 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of 40.58s. In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.87 and HD95 of 2.15 with the held-out test data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Task Planning for Multi-Object Retrieval Tasks with Distributed On-Site Knowledge via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment, sequential planning, and execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.

      <title>FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Communications to Circulations: 3D Wind Field Retrieval and Real-Time Prediction Using 5G GNSS Signals and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios. The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data. Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</description>

      <title>Robust LLM Training Infrastructure at ByteDance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.</description>

      <title>KANO: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.</description>

      <title>U-Mamba2-SSL for Semi-Supervised Tooth and Pulp Segmentation in CBCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL achieved an average score of 0.789 and a DSC of 0.917 on the hidden test set, achieving first place in Task 1 of the STSR 2025 challenge. The code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</description>

      <title>Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Defense in Cybersecurity: A Systematic Review of GANs for Threat Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31, 2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185 peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain, and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet, persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability. GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered defenses.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Individual: Introducing Group Intention Forecasting with SHOT Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting. The dataset is available at https://xinyi-hu.github.io/SHOT_DATASET.</description>

      <title>Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.</description>

      <title>Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) \underline{\textbf{L}}azy learning, (II) \underline{\textbf{i}}ndependent feature learning and (III) \underline{\textbf{i}}nteractive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize. Thanks to lazy learning and weight decay, the \emph{backpropagated gradient} $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation \emph{independently}. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the \emph{gradient ascent} of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Attribution: Elucidating and Controlling Backdoor in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, yet the internal mechanisms governing these attacks remain a black box. Previous research on interpretability for LLM safety tends to focus on alignment, jailbreak, and hallucination, but overlooks backdoor mechanisms, making it difficult to understand and fully eliminate the backdoor threat. In this paper, aiming to bridge this gap, we explore the interpretable mechanisms of LLM backdoors through Backdoor Attribution (BkdAttr), a tripartite causal analysis framework. We first introduce the Backdoor Probe that proves the existence of learnable backdoor features encoded within the representations. Building on this insight, we further develop Backdoor Attention Head Attribution (BAHA), efficiently pinpointing the specific attention heads responsible for processing these features. Our primary experiments reveals these heads are relatively sparse; ablating a minimal \textbf{$\sim$ 3%} of total heads is sufficient to reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by \textbf{over 90%}. More importantly, we further employ these findings to construct the Backdoor Vector derived from these attributed heads as a master controller for the backdoor. Through only \textbf{1-point} intervention on \textbf{single} representation, the vector can either boost ASR up to \textbf{$\sim$ 100% ($\uparrow$)} on clean inputs, or completely neutralize backdoor, suppressing ASR down to \textbf{$\sim$ 0% ($\downarrow$)} on triggered inputs. In conclusion, our work pioneers the exploration of mechanistic interpretability in LLM backdoors, demonstrating a powerful method for backdoor control and revealing actionable insights for the community.</description>

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE, recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph structure is important.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Analysis of LLM Effects on Students across Qualification, Socialisation, and Subjectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly positioned as solutions for education, yet evaluations often reduce their impact to narrow performance metrics. This paper reframes the question by asking "what kind of impact should LLMs have in education?" Drawing on Biesta's tripartite account of good education: qualification, socialisation, and subjectification, we present a meta-analysis of 133 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (k = 188). Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education. For HCI and education, the issue is not just whether LLMs work, but what futures they enable or foreclose.</description>

      <title>Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.</description>

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

      <title>Sequence Pathfinder for Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery in the Warehouse</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making. Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in complex maps like warehouses.</description>

      <title>Explore-Execute Chain: Towards an Efficient Structured Reasoning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution. This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using &lt;10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution.

      <title>FameMind: Frame-Interleaved Video Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies, processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.</description>

      <title>TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</description>

      <title>Conda: Column-Normalized Adam for Training Large Language Models Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose Column-Normalized Adam (Conda), a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, Conda achieves 2-2.5 the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time. Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training.

      <title>Q-Mirror: Unlocking the Multi-Modal Potential of Scientific Text-Only QA Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable. To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include three parts: 1) Task Definition \&amp; Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction: Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art generation \&amp; understanding models on the distinct tasks of MMQA generation \&amp; MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path to large-scale scientific benchmarks.</description>

      <title>UI-UG: A Unified MLLM for UI Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks. Code and Model: https://github.com/neovateai/UI-UG</description>

      <title>VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.</description>

      <title>BRIDGE -- Building Reinforcement-Learning Depth-to-Image Data Generation Engine for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision. Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image (D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth features.
