      <title>FinSphere: A Conversational Stock Analysis Agent Equipped with Quantitative Tools based on Real-Time Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current financial Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with two critical limitations: a lack of depth in stock analysis, which impedes their ability to generate professional-grade insights, and the absence of objective evaluation metrics to assess the quality of stock analysis reports. To address these challenges, this paper introduces FinSphere, a conversational stock analysis agent, along with three major contributions: (1) Stocksis, a dataset curated by industry experts to enhance LLMs' stock analysis capabilities, (2) AnalyScore, a systematic evaluation framework for assessing stock analysis quality, and (3) FinSphere, an AI agent that can generate high-quality stock analysis reports in response to user queries. Experiments demonstrate that FinSphere achieves superior performance compared to both general and domain-specific LLMs, as well as existing agent-based systems, even when they are enhanced with real-time data access and few-shot guidance. The integrated framework, which combines real-time data feeds, quantitative tools, and an instruction-tuned LLM, yields substantial improvements in both analytical quality and practical applicability for real-world stock analysis.</description>

      <title>Control-ITRA: Controlling the Behavior of a Driving Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating realistic driving behavior is crucial for developing and testing autonomous systems in complex traffic environments. Equally important is the ability to control the behavior of simulated agents to tailor scenarios to specific research needs and safety considerations. This paper extends the general-purpose multi-agent driving behavior model ITRA (Scibior et al., 2021), by introducing a method called Control-ITRA to influence agent behavior through waypoint assignment and target speed modulation. By conditioning agents on these two aspects, we provide a mechanism for them to adhere to specific trajectories and indirectly adjust their aggressiveness. We compare different approaches for integrating these conditions during training and demonstrate that our method can generate controllable, infraction-free trajectories while preserving realism in both seen and unseen locations.</description>

      <title>R2D2: Remembering, Reflecting and Dynamic Decision Making for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of web agents necessitates advanced navigation and interaction strategies within complex web environments. Current models often struggle with efficient navigation and action execution due to limited visibility and understanding of web structures. Our proposed R2D2 framework addresses these challenges by integrating two paradigms: Remember and Reflect. The Remember paradigm utilizes a replay buffer that aids agents in reconstructing the web environment dynamically, thus enabling the formulation of a detailed ``map'' of previously visited pages. This helps in reducing navigational errors and optimizing the decision-making process during web interactions. Conversely, the Reflect paradigm allows agents to learn from past mistakes by providing a mechanism for error analysis and strategy refinement, enhancing overall task performance. We evaluate R2D2 using the WEBARENA benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods, including a 50% reduction in navigation errors and a threefold increase in task completion rates. Our findings suggest that a combination of memory-enhanced navigation and reflective learning promisingly advances the capabilities of web agents, potentially benefiting various applications such as automated customer service and personal digital assistants.</description>

      <title>Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</description>

      <title>Offline Critic-Guided Diffusion Policy for Multi-User Delay-Constrained Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective multi-user delay-constrained scheduling is crucial in various real-world applications, such as instant messaging, live streaming, and data center management. In these scenarios, schedulers must make real-time decisions to satisfy both delay and resource constraints without prior knowledge of system dynamics, which are often time-varying and challenging to estimate. Current learning-based methods typically require interactions with actual systems during the training stage, which can be difficult or impractical, as it is capable of significantly degrading system performance and incurring substantial service costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel offline reinforcement learning-based algorithm, named \underline{S}cheduling By \underline{O}ffline Learning with \underline{C}ritic Guidance and \underline{D}iffusion Generation (SOCD), to learn efficient scheduling policies purely from pre-collected \emph{offline data}. SOCD innovatively employs a diffusion-based policy network, complemented by a sampling-free critic network for policy guidance. By integrating the Lagrangian multiplier optimization into the offline reinforcement learning, SOCD effectively trains high-quality constraint-aware policies exclusively from available datasets, eliminating the need for online interactions with the system. Experimental results demonstrate that SOCD is resilient to various system dynamics, including partially observable and large-scale environments, and delivers superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Evolution and The Knightian Blindspot of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning (ML) largely overlooks an important facet of general intelligence: robustness to a qualitatively unknown future in an open world. Such robustness relates to Knightian uncertainty (KU) in economics, i.e. uncertainty that cannot be quantified, which is excluded from consideration in ML's key formalisms. This paper aims to identify this blind spot, argue its importance, and catalyze research into addressing it, which we believe is necessary to create truly robust open-world AI. To help illuminate the blind spot, we contrast one area of ML, reinforcement learning (RL), with the process of biological evolution. Despite staggering ongoing progress, RL still struggles in open-world situations, often failing under unforeseen situations. For example, the idea of zero-shot transferring a self-driving car policy trained only in the US to the UK currently seems exceedingly ambitious. In dramatic contrast, biological evolution routinely produces agents that thrive within an open world, sometimes even to situations that are remarkably out-of-distribution (e.g. invasive species; or humans, who do undertake such zero-shot international driving). Interestingly, evolution achieves such robustness without explicit theory, formalisms, or mathematical gradients. We explore the assumptions underlying RL's typical formalisms, showing how they limit RL's engagement with the unknown unknowns characteristic of an ever-changing complex world. Further, we identify mechanisms through which evolutionary processes foster robustness to novel and unpredictable challenges, and discuss potential pathways to algorithmically embody them. The conclusion is that the intriguing remaining fragility of ML may result from blind spots in its formalisms, and that significant gains may result from direct confrontation with the challenge of KU.</description>

      <title>Boosting MCTS with Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides a powerful lens for understanding how agents balance exploration and goal-directed behavior in uncertain environments. Here, we propose a new planning framework, that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with active inference objectives to systematically reduce epistemic uncertainty while pursuing extrinsic rewards. Our key insight is that MCTS already renowned for its search efficiency can be naturally extended to incorporate free energy minimization by blending expected rewards with information gain. Concretely, the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is used to optimize action proposals at the root node, while tree expansions leverage reward modeling alongside intrinsic exploration bonuses. This synergy allows our planner to maintain coherent estimates of value and uncertainty throughout planning, without sacrificing computational tractability. Empirically, we benchmark our planner on a diverse set of continuous control tasks, where it demonstrates performance gains over both standalone CEM and MCTS with random rollouts.</description>

      <title>Scopes of Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the research focus on AI alignment seeks to align large language models and other foundation models to the context-less and generic values of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. Frontier model providers also strive to align their models with these values. In this paper, we motivate why we need to move beyond such a limited conception and propose three dimensions for doing so. The first scope of alignment is competence: knowledge, skills, or behaviors the model must possess to be useful for its intended purpose. The second scope of alignment is transience: either semantic or episodic depending on the context of use. The third scope of alignment is audience: either mass, public, small-group, or dyadic. At the end of the paper, we use the proposed framework to position some technologies and workflows that go beyond prevailing notions of alignment.</description>

      <title>ImageRef-VL: Enabling Contextual Image Referencing in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal inputs and have been widely integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based conversational systems. While current VLM-powered chatbots can provide textual source references in their responses, they exhibit significant limitations in referencing contextually relevant images during conversations. In this paper, we introduce Contextual Image Reference -- the ability to appropriately reference relevant images from retrieval documents based on conversation context -- and systematically investigate VLMs' capability in this aspect. We conduct the first evaluation for contextual image referencing, comprising a dedicated testing dataset and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we propose ImageRef-VL, a method that significantly enhances open-source VLMs' image referencing capabilities through instruction fine-tuning on a large-scale, manually curated multimodal conversation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageRef-VL not only outperforms proprietary models but also achieves an 88% performance improvement over state-of-the-art open-source VLMs in contextual image referencing tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ImageRef-VL.</description>

      <title>Consolidating TinyML Lifecycle with Large Language Models: Reality, Illusion, or Opportunity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolving requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) applications are driving an increasing shift toward bringing intelligence to the edge, enabling real-time insights and decision-making within resource-constrained environments. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has emerged as a key enabler of this evolution, facilitating the deployment of ML models on devices such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. However, the complexity of managing the TinyML lifecycle, including stages such as data processing, model optimization and conversion, and device deployment, presents significant challenges and often requires substantial human intervention. Motivated by these challenges, we began exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) could help automate and streamline the TinyML lifecycle. We developed a framework that leverages the natural language processing (NLP) and code generation capabilities of LLMs to reduce development time and lower the barriers to entry for TinyML deployment. Through a case study involving a computer vision classification model, we demonstrate the framework's ability to automate key stages of the TinyML lifecycle. Our findings suggest that LLM-powered automation holds potential for improving the lifecycle development process and adapting to diverse requirements. However, while this approach shows promise, there remain obstacles and limitations, particularly in achieving fully automated solutions. This paper sheds light on both the challenges and opportunities of integrating LLMs into TinyML workflows, providing insights into the path forward for efficient, AI-assisted embedded system development.</description>

      <title>Tackling Small Sample Survival Analysis via Transfer Learning: A Study of Colorectal Cancer Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival prognosis is crucial for medical informatics. Practitioners often confront small-sized clinical data, especially cancer patient cases, which can be insufficient to induce useful patterns for survival predictions. This study deals with small sample survival analysis by leveraging transfer learning, a useful machine learning technique that can enhance the target analysis with related knowledge pre-learned from other data. We propose and develop various transfer learning methods designed for common survival models. For parametric models such as DeepSurv, Cox-CC (Cox-based neural networks), and DeepHit (end-to-end deep learning model), we apply standard transfer learning techniques like pretraining and fine-tuning. For non-parametric models such as Random Survival Forest, we propose a new transfer survival forest (TSF) model that transfers tree structures from source tasks and fine-tunes them with target data. We evaluated the transfer learning methods on colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. The source data are 27,379 SEER CRC stage I patients, and the target data are 728 CRC stage I patients from the West China Hospital. When enhanced by transfer learning, Cox-CC's $C^{td}$ value was boosted from 0.7868 to 0.8111, DeepHit's from 0.8085 to 0.8135, DeepSurv's from 0.7722 to 0.8043, and RSF's from 0.7940 to 0.8297 (the highest performance). All models trained with data as small as 50 demonstrated even more significant improvement. Conclusions: Therefore, the current survival models used for cancer prognosis can be enhanced and improved by properly designed transfer learning techniques.

      <title>CroMe: Multimodal Fake News Detection using Cross-Modal Tri-Transformer and Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Fake News Detection has received increasing attention recently. Existing methods rely on independently encoded unimodal data and overlook the advantages of capturing intra-modality relationships and integrating inter-modal similarities using advanced techniques. To address these issues, Cross-Modal Tri-Transformer and Metric Learning for Multimodal Fake News Detection (CroMe) is proposed. CroMe utilizes Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models (BLIP2) as encoders to capture detailed text, image and combined image-text representations. The metric learning module employs a proxy anchor method to capture intra-modality relationships while the feature fusion module uses a Cross-Modal and Tri-Transformer for effective integration. The final fake news detector processes the fused features through a classifier to predict the authenticity of the content. Experiments on datasets show that CroMe excels in multimodal fake news detection.</description>

      <title>FREYR: A Framework for Recognizing and Executing Your Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel as conversational agents, but their capabilities can be further extended through tool usage, i.e.: executable code, to enhance response accuracy or address specialized domains. Current approaches to enable tool usage often rely on model-specific prompting or fine-tuning a model for function-calling instructions. Both approaches have notable limitations, including reduced adaptability to unseen tools and high resource requirements. This paper introduces FREYR, a streamlined framework that modularizes the tool usage process into separate steps. Through this decomposition, we show that FREYR achieves superior performance compared to conventional tool usage methods. We evaluate FREYR on a set of real-world test cases specific for video game design and compare it against traditional tool usage as provided by the Ollama API.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning for Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) identifies individuals' sentiment states in videos by integrating visual, audio, and text modalities. Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

      <title>Multi-stage intermediate fusion for multimodal learning to classify non-small cell lung cancer subtypes from CT and PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential in the era of precision medicine, yet current invasive techniques are not always feasible and may lead to clinical complications. This study presents a multi-stage intermediate fusion approach to classify NSCLC subtypes from CT and PET images. Our method integrates the two modalities at different stages of feature extraction, using voxel-wise fusion to exploit complementary information across varying abstraction levels while preserving spatial correlations. We compare our method against unimodal approaches using only CT or PET images to demonstrate the benefits of modality fusion, and further benchmark it against early and late fusion techniques to highlight the advantages of intermediate fusion during feature extraction. Additionally, we compare our model with the only existing intermediate fusion method for histological subtype classification using PET/CT images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all alternatives across key metrics, with an accuracy and AUC equal to 0.724 and 0.681, respectively. This non-invasive approach has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate more informed treatment decisions, and advance personalized care in lung cancer management.</description>

      <title>SafePowerGraph-HIL: Real-Time HIL Validation of Heterogeneous GNNs for Bridging Sim-to-Real Gap in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) techniques gain prominence in power system research, validating these methods' effectiveness under real-world conditions requires real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. HIL simulation platforms enable the integration of computational models with physical devices, allowing rigorous testing across diverse scenarios critical to system resilience and reliability. In this study, we develop a SafePowerGraph-HIL framework that utilizes HIL simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system, modeled in Hypersim, to generate high-fidelity data, which is then transmitted in real-time via SCADA to an AWS cloud database before being input into a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model designed for power system state estimation and dynamic analysis. By leveraging Hypersim's capabilities, we simulate complex grid interactions, providing a robust dataset that captures critical parameters for HGNN training. The trained HGNN is subsequently validated using newly generated data under varied system conditions, demonstrating accuracy and robustness in predicting power system states. The results underscore the potential of integrating HIL with advanced neural network architectures to enhance the real-time operational capabilities of power systems. This approach represents a significant advancement toward the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that support the robustness and resilience of evolving power grids.</description>

      <title>SplitQuant: Layer Splitting for Low-Bit Neural Network Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization for deep neural networks (DNNs) is the process of mapping the parameter values of DNNs from original data types to other data types of lower precision to reduce model sizes and make inference faster. Quantization often maps different original values to a single quantized value because the range of the original values is larger than the range of the quantized values. This leads to the degradation of the accuracy of the quantized DNNs. Outliers are a main cause of the degradation of quantization resolution because they enlarge the range of original values. To solve the problem, the percentile method is often used to clip outliers. However, clipping the outliers has another problem of removing the important and strong signals in the DNNs. This paper proposes SplitQuant to keep the outliers and improve the quantization resolution at the same time. SplitQuant narrows down the range of the original values and mitigates the effect of outliers by splitting each quantizable layer into three mathematically equivalent layers and applies different scaling factors. Especially, weights and biases are clustered into lower, middle and upper clusters for optimized split. By preprocessing DNNs with SplitQuant, quantization algorithms can achieve better results. SplitQuant was applied on two BERT-Tiny models and improved the accuracy of INT2 quantization by 3.3%p and 2.1%p, achieving accuracies comparable to those of the original FP32 models.</description>

      <title>Fuel Efficiency Analysis of the Public Transportation System Based on the Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need to improve bus fuel efficiency. Clustering algorithms assist in analyzing fuel efficiency by grouping data into clusters, but irrelevant features may complicate the analysis and choosing the optimal number of clusters remains a challenging task. Therefore, this paper employs the Gaussian mixture models to cluster the solo fuel-efficiency dataset. Moreover, an integration method that combines the Silhouette index, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index is developed to select the optimal cluster numbers. A dataset with 4006 bus trips in North Jutland, Denmark is utilized as the case study. Trips are first split into three groups, then one group is divided further, resulting in four categories: extreme, normal, low, and extremely low fuel efficiency. A preliminary study using visualization analysis is conducted to investigate how driving behaviors and route conditions affect fuel efficiency. The results indicate that both individual driving habits and route characteristics have a significant influence on fuel efficiency.</description>

      <title>SCFCRC: Simultaneously Counteract Feature Camouflage and Relation Camouflage for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fraud detection, fraudsters often interact with many benign users, camouflaging their features or relations to hide themselves. Most existing work concentrates solely on either feature camouflage or relation camouflage, or decoupling feature learning and relation learning to avoid the two camouflage from affecting each other. However, this inadvertently neglects the valuable information derived from features or relations, which could mutually enhance their adversarial camouflage strategies. In response to this gap, we propose SCFCRC, a Transformer-based fraud detector that Simultaneously Counteract Feature Camouflage and Relation Camouflage. SCFCRC consists of two components: Feature Camouflage Filter and Relation Camouflage Refiner. The feature camouflage filter utilizes pseudo labels generated through label propagation to train the filter and uses contrastive learning that combines instance-wise and prototype-wise to improve the quality of features. The relation camouflage refiner uses Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) network to disassemble the multi-relations graph into multiple substructures and divide and conquer them to mitigate the degradation of detection performance caused by relation camouflage. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization method for MoE to enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive experiments on two fraud detection benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, eroding trust, exacerbating inequality, and amplifying harmful narratives. Detecting fake news in multimodal contexts -- where deceptive content combines text and images -- is particularly challenging due to the nuanced interplay between modalities. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods often emphasize cross-modal consistency but ignore the complex interactions between text and visual elements, which may complement, contradict, or independently influence the predicted veracity of a post. To address these challenges, we present Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly modeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our approach models modality interactions by evaluating two key aspects of modality interactions: unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment. The hierarchical structure of MIMoE-FND allows for distinct learning pathways tailored to different fusion scenarios, adapting to the unique characteristics of each modality interaction. By tailoring fusion strategies to diverse modality interaction scenarios, MIMoE-FND provides a more robust and nuanced approach to multimodal fake news detection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world benchmarks spanning two languages, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of fake news detection, MIMoE-FND offers a promising tool to mitigate the spread of misinformation, with the potential to better safeguard vulnerable communities against its harmful effects.</description>

      <title>Divide-Then-Aggregate: An Efficient Tool Learning Method via Parallel Tool Invocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, performing complex real-world tasks still requires tool learning. Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5.

      <title>Owls are wise and foxes are unfaithful: Uncovering animal stereotypes in vision-language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animal stereotypes are deeply embedded in human culture and language. They often shape our perceptions and expectations of various species. Our study investigates how animal stereotypes manifest in vision-language models during the task of image generation. Through targeted prompts, we explore whether DALL-E perpetuates stereotypical representations of animals, such as "owls as wise," "foxes as unfaithful," etc. Our findings reveal significant stereotyped instances where the model consistently generates images aligned with cultural biases. The current work is the first of its kind to examine animal stereotyping in vision-language models systematically and to highlight a critical yet underexplored dimension of bias in AI-generated visual content.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retrosynthesis with Conformer: A Template-Free Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis plays a crucial role in the fields of organic synthesis and drug development, where the goal is to identify suitable reactants that can yield a target product molecule. Although existing methods have achieved notable success, they typically overlook the 3D conformational details and internal spatial organization of molecules. This oversight makes it challenging to predict reactants that conform to genuine chemical principles, particularly when dealing with complex molecular structures, such as polycyclic and heteroaromatic compounds. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel transformer-based, template-free approach that incorporates 3D conformer data and spatial information. Our approach includes an Atom-align Fusion module that integrates 3D positional data at the input stage, ensuring correct alignment between atom tokens and their respective 3D coordinates. Additionally, we propose a Distance-weighted Attention mechanism that refines the self-attention process, constricting the model s focus to relevant atom pairs in 3D space. Extensive experiments on the USPTO-50K dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous template-free methods, setting a new benchmark for the field. A case study further highlights our method s ability to predict reasonable and accurate reactants.</description>

      <title>Deploying Privacy Guardrails for LLMs: A Comparative Analysis of Real-World Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI applications but poses significant challenges in safeguarding user privacy. Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA while addressing nuanced privacy risks requires robust and scalable frameworks. This paper presents a detailed study of OneShield Privacy Guard, a framework designed to mitigate privacy risks in user inputs and LLM outputs across enterprise and open-source settings. We analyze two real-world deployments:(1) a multilingual privacy-preserving system integrated with Data and Model Factory, focusing on enterprise-scale data governance; and (2) PR Insights, an open-source repository emphasizing automated triaging and community-driven refinements. In Deployment 1, OneShield achieved a 0.95 F1 score in detecting sensitive entities like dates, names, and phone numbers across 26 languages, outperforming state-of-the-art tool such as StarPII and Presidio by up to 12\%. Deployment 2, with an average F1 score of 0.86, reduced manual effort by over 300 hours in three months, accurately flagging 8.25\% of 1,256 pull requests for privacy risks with enhanced context sensitivity. These results demonstrate OneShield's adaptability and efficacy in diverse environments, offering actionable insights for context-aware entity recognition, automated compliance, and ethical AI adoption. This work advances privacy-preserving frameworks, supporting user trust and compliance across operational contexts.</description>

      <title>Adaptive PII Mitigation Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces growing challenges from evolving data protection laws and enforcement practices worldwide. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA impose strict compliance requirements on Machine Learning (ML) models, especially concerning personal data use. These laws grant individuals rights such as data correction and deletion, complicating the training and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on extensive datasets. Public data availability does not guarantee its lawful use for ML, amplifying these challenges.
  This paper introduces an adaptive system for mitigating risk of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) in LLMs. It dynamically aligns with diverse regulatory frameworks and integrates seamlessly into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) systems. The system uses advanced NLP techniques, context-aware analysis, and policy-driven masking to ensure regulatory compliance.
  Benchmarks highlight the system's effectiveness, with an F1 score of 0.95 for Passport Numbers, outperforming tools like Microsoft Presidio (0.33) and Amazon Comprehend (0.54). In human evaluations, the system achieved an average user trust score of 4.6/5, with participants acknowledging its accuracy and transparency. Observations demonstrate stricter anonymization under GDPR compared to CCPA, which permits pseudonymization and user opt-outs. These results validate the system as a scalable and robust solution for enterprise privacy compliance.</description>

Abstract: Degree Based Logical Adjacency Checking (DBLAC). An efficient coloring of graphs with unique logical AND operations. The logical AND operation shows more effective color assignment and fewer number of induced colors in the case of common edges between vertices. In this work, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of DBLAC's time and space complexity. It furthermore shows its effectiveness through prolonged experiments on standard benchmark graphs. We compare it with existing algorithms, namely DSATUR and Recursive Largest First (RLF). Second, we show how DBLAC achieves competitive results with respect to both the number of colors used and runtime performance.</description>

      <title>fabSAM: A Farmland Boundary Delineation Method Based on the Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating farmland boundaries is essential for agricultural management such as crop monitoring and agricultural census. Traditional methods using remote sensing imagery have been efficient but limited in generalisation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its impressive zero shot performance, has been adapted for remote sensing tasks through prompt learning and fine tuning. Here, we propose a SAM based farmland boundary delineation framework 'fabSAM' that combines a Deeplabv3+ based Prompter and SAM. Also, a fine tuning strategy was introduced to enable SAMs decoder to improve the use of prompt information. Experimental results on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets have shown that fabSAM has a significant improvement in farmland region identification and boundary delineation. Compared to zero shot SAM, fabSAM surpassed it by 23.5% and 15.1% in mIOU on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets, respectively. For Deeplabv3+, fabSAM outperformed it by 4.9% and 12.5% in mIOU, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of fabSAM, which also means that we can more easily obtain the global farmland region and boundary maps from open source satellite image datasets like Sentinel2.</description>

      <title>Large-image Object Detection for Fine-grained Recognition of Punches Patterns in Medieval Panel Painting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.</description>

      <title>The Finite Element Neural Network Method: One Dimensional Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of neural networks (NN) in engineering is rooted in their capacity to understand intricate patterns and complex systems, leveraging their universal nonlinear approximation capabilities and high expressivity. Meanwhile, conventional numerical methods, backed by years of meticulous refinement, continue to be the standard for accuracy and dependability. Bridging these paradigms, this research introduces the finite element neural network method (FENNM) within the framework of the Petrov-Galerkin method using convolution operations to approximate the weighted residual of the differential equations. The NN generates the global trial solution, while the test functions belong to the Lagrange test function space. FENNM introduces several key advantages. Notably, the weak-form of the differential equations introduces flux terms that contribute information to the loss function compared to VPINN, hp-VPINN, and cv-PINN. This enables the integration of forcing terms and natural boundary conditions into the loss function similar to conventional finite element method (FEM) solvers, facilitating its optimization, and extending its applicability to more complex problems, which will ease industrial adoption. This study will elaborate on the derivation of FENNM, highlighting its similarities with FEM. Additionally, it will provide insights into optimal utilization strategies and user guidelines to ensure cost-efficiency. Finally, the study illustrates the robustness and accuracy of FENNM by presenting multiple numerical case studies and applying adaptive mesh refinement techniques.</description>

      <title>An Empirically-grounded tool for Automatic Prompt Linting and Repair: A Case Study on Bias, Vulnerability, and Optimization in Developer Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal wave of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their swift integration into application-level logic. Many software systems now use prompts to interact with these black-box models, combining natural language with dynamic values interpolated at runtime, to perform tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering. Due to the programmatic and structured natural language aspects of these prompts, we refer to them as Developer Prompts. Unlike traditional software artifacts, Dev Prompts blend natural language instructions with artificial languages such as programming and markup languages, thus requiring specialized tools for analysis, distinct from classical software evaluation methods.
  In response to this need, we introduce PromptDoctor, a tool explicitly designed to detect and correct issues of Dev Prompts. PromptDoctor identifies and addresses problems related to bias, vulnerability, and sub-optimal performance in Dev Prompts, helping mitigate their possible harms. In our analysis of 2,173 Dev Prompts, selected as a representative sample of 40,573 Dev Prompts, we found that 3.46% contained one or more forms of bias, 10.75% were vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Additionally, 3,310 were amenable to automated prompt optimization. To address these issues, we applied PromptDoctor to the flawed Dev Prompts we discovered. PromptDoctor de-biased 68.29% of the biased Dev Prompts, hardened 41.81% of the vulnerable Dev Prompts, and improved the performance of 37.1% sub-optimal Dev Prompts. Finally, we developed a PromptDoctor VSCode extension, enabling developers to easily enhance Dev Prompts in their existing development workflows.

      <title>Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Interaction Dataset of Autonomous Vehicles with Traffic Lights and Signs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dataset capturing interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and traffic control devices, specifically traffic lights and stop signs. Derived from the Waymo Motion dataset, our work addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by providing real-world trajectory data on how AVs navigate these traffic control devices. We propose a methodology for identifying and extracting relevant interaction trajectory data from the Waymo Motion dataset, incorporating over 37,000 instances with traffic lights and 44,000 with stop signs. Our methodology includes defining rules to identify various interaction types, extracting trajectory data, and applying a wavelet-based denoising method to smooth the acceleration and speed profiles and eliminate anomalous values, thereby enhancing the trajectory quality. Quality assessment metrics indicate that trajectories obtained in this study have anomaly proportions in acceleration and jerk profiles reduced to near-zero levels across all interaction categories. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to address the current gap in datasets containing AV interaction behaviors with traffic lights and signs. Based on the organized and published dataset, we can gain a more in-depth understanding of AVs' behavior when interacting with traffic lights and signs. This will facilitate research on AV integration into existing transportation infrastructures and networks, supporting the development of more accurate behavioral models and simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Academic Case Reports Lack Diversity: Assessing the Presence and Diversity of Sociodemographic and Behavioral Factors related with Post COVID-19 Condition</title>

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence, disparities, and symptom variations of Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC) for vulnerable populations is crucial to improving care and addressing intersecting inequities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into PCC research by leveraging NLP techniques to analyze disparities and variations in SDOH representation within PCC case reports. Following construction of a PCC Case Report Corpus, comprising over 7,000 case reports from the LitCOVID repository, a subset of 709 reports were annotated with 26 core SDOH-related entity types using pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models, human review, and data augmentation to improve quality, diversity and representation of entity types. An NLP pipeline integrating NER, natural language inference (NLI), trigram and frequency analyses was developed to extract and analyze these entities. Both encoder-only transformer models and RNN-based models were assessed for the NER objective.
  Fine-tuned encoder-only BERT models outperformed traditional RNN-based models in generalizability to distinct sentence structures and greater class sparsity. Exploratory analysis revealed variability in entity richness, with prevalent entities like condition, age, and access to care, and underrepresentation of sensitive categories like race and housing status. Trigram analysis highlighted frequent co-occurrences among entities, including age, gender, and condition. The NLI objective (entailment and contradiction analysis) showed attributes like "Experienced violence or abuse" and "Has medical insurance" had high entailment rates (82.4%-80.3%), while attributes such as "Is female-identifying," "Is married," and "Has a terminal condition" exhibited high contradiction rates (70.8%-98.5%).</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search for Parameter Optimization of Paper Drying Under Flexible Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to enforcing design constraints in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications often rely on training-time penalties in the reward function or training/inference-time invalid action masking, but these methods either cannot be modified after training, or are limited in the types of constraints that can be implemented. To address this limitation, we propose Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search (RLCBS) for inference-time refinement in combinatorial optimization problems. This method respects flexible, inference-time constraints that support exclusion of invalid actions and forced inclusion of desired actions, and employs beam search to maximize sequence probability for more sensible constraint incorporation. RLCBS is extensible to RL-based planning and optimization problems that do not require real-time solution, and we apply the method to optimize process parameters for a novel modular testbed for paper drying. An RL agent is trained to minimize energy consumption across varying machine speed levels by generating optimal dryer module and air supply temperature configurations. Our results demonstrate that RLCBS outperforms NSGA-II under complex design constraints on drying module configurations at inference-time, while providing a 2.58-fold or higher speed improvement.</description>

      <title>Human-like conceptual representations emerge from language prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide a new opportunity to address the long-standing question of how concepts are represented and organized in the mind, which is central to unravelling the nature of human cognition. Here, we reframed the classic reverse dictionary task to simulate human concept inference in context and investigated the emergence of human-like conceptual representations within LLMs. We found that LLMs were able to infer concepts from definitional descriptions and construct representation spaces that converge towards a shared, context-independent structure. These representations effectively predicted human behavioural judgments and aligned well with neural activity patterns in the human brain, offering evidence for biological plausibility. These findings demonstrate that human-like conceptual representations and organization can naturally emerge from language prediction, even without real-world grounding. Our work supports the view that LLMs serve as valuable tools for understanding complex human cognition and paves the way for better alignment between artificial and human intelligence.</description>

      <title>Understanding the LLM-ification of CHI: Unpacking the Impact of LLMs at CHI through a Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been positioned to revolutionize HCI, by reshaping not only the interfaces, design patterns, and sociotechnical systems that we study, but also the research practices we use. To-date, however, there has been little understanding of LLMs' uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a systematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with LLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in HCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and risks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and artifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as research tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and reproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline opportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding questions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of LLM-related work.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to Create a Haptic Devices' Recommendation System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haptic technology has seen significant growth, yet a lack of awareness of existing haptic device design knowledge hinders development. This paper addresses these limitations by leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a haptic agent, focusing specifically on Grounded Force Feedback (GFF) devices recommendation. Our approach involves automating the creation of a structured haptic device database using information from research papers and product specifications. This database enables the recommendation of relevant GFF devices based on user queries. To ensure precise and contextually relevant recommendations, the system employs a dynamic retrieval method that combines both conditional and semantic searches. Benchmarking against the established UEQ and existing haptic device searching tools, the proposed haptic recommendation agent ranks in the top 10\% across all UEQ categories with mean differences favoring the agent in nearly all subscales, and maintains no significant performance bias across different user groups, showcasing superior usability and user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>FedGrAINS: Personalized SubGraph Federated Learning with Adaptive Neighbor Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are crucial for modeling relational and biological data. As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</description>

      <title>A Unified Invariant Learning Framework for Graph Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification, based on the premise that these features causally determine the target label, and their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line, most studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing explicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and primarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph representations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may not accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce the Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It provides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both structural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable features. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance principle by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable features across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic invariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should demonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize superior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive experiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL considerably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading baseline methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/yongduosui/UIL.</description>

      <title>GATE: Adaptive Learning with Working Memory by Information Gating in Multi-lamellar Hippocampal Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hippocampal formation (HF) can rapidly adapt to varied environments and build flexible working memory (WM). To mirror the HF's mechanism on generalization and WM, we propose a model named Generalization and Associative Temporary Encoding (GATE), which deploys a 3-D multi-lamellar dorsoventral (DV) architecture, and learns to build up internally representation from externally driven information layer-wisely. In each lamella, regions of HF: EC3-CA1-EC5-EC3 forms a re-entrant loop that discriminately maintains information by EC3 persistent activity, and selectively readouts the retained information by CA1 neurons. CA3 and EC5 further provides gating function that controls these processes. After learning complex WM tasks, GATE forms neuron representations that align with experimental records, including splitter, lap, evidence, trace, delay-active cells, as well as conventional place cells. Crucially, DV architecture in GATE also captures information, range from detailed to abstract, which enables a rapid generalization ability when cue, environment or task changes, with learned representations inherited. GATE promises a viable framework for understanding the HF's flexible memory mechanisms and for progressively developing brain-inspired intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Identification of Inconsistent Method Names: How Far Are We?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concise and meaningful method names are crucial for program comprehension and maintenance. However, method names may become inconsistent with their corresponding implementations, causing confusion and errors. Several deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed to identify such inconsistencies, with initial evaluations showing promising results. However, these evaluations typically use a balanced dataset, where the number of inconsistent and consistent names are equal. This setup, along with flawed dataset construction, leads to false positives, making reported performance less reliable in real-world scenarios, where most method names are consistent. In this paper, we present an empirical study that evaluates state-of-the-art DL-based methods for identifying inconsistent method names. We create a new benchmark by combining automatic identification from commit histories and manual developer inspections, reducing false positives. We evaluate five representative DL approaches (one retrieval-based and four generation-based) on this benchmark. Our results show that performance drops substantially when moving from the balanced dataset to the new benchmark. We further conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. Retrieval-based methods perform well on simple methods and those with popular name sub-tokens but fail due to inefficient representation techniques. Generation-based methods struggle with inaccurate similarity calculations and immature name generation. Based on these findings, we propose improvements using contrastive learning and large language models (LLMs). Our study suggests that significant improvements are needed before these DL approaches can be effectively applied to real-world software systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ADEPT: Adaptive Data ExPloiTation, a simple yet powerful framework to enhance the **data efficiency** and **generalization** in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, ADEPT adaptively manages the use of sampled data across different learning stages via multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms, optimizing data utilization while mitigating overfitting. Moreover, ADEPT can significantly reduce the computational overhead and accelerate a wide range of RL algorithms. We test ADEPT on benchmarks including Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive simulation demonstrates that ADEPT can achieve superior performance with remarkable computational efficiency, offering a practical solution to data-efficient RL.

      <title>Towards Robust Multi-tab Website Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Website fingerprinting enables an eavesdropper to determine which websites a user is visiting over an encrypted connection. State-of-the-art website fingerprinting (WF) attacks have demonstrated effectiveness even against Tor-protected network traffic. However, existing WF attacks have critical limitations on accurately identifying websites in multi-tab browsing sessions, where the holistic pattern of individual websites is no longer preserved, and the number of tabs opened by a client is unknown a priori. In this paper, we propose ARES, a novel WF framework natively designed for multi-tab WF attacks. ARES formulates the multi-tab attack as a multi-label classification problem and solves it using the novel Transformer-based models. Specifically, ARES extracts local patterns based on multi-level traffic aggregation features and utilizes the improved self-attention mechanism to analyze the correlations between these local patterns, effectively identifying websites. We implement a prototype of ARES and extensively evaluate its effectiveness using our large-scale datasets collected over multiple months. The experimental results illustrate that ARES achieves optimal performance in several realistic scenarios. Further, ARES remains robust even against various WF defenses.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Toxicity in Political Podcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity in digital media poses significant challenges, yet little attention has been given to its dynamics within the rapidly growing medium of podcasts. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing political podcast data to study the emergence and propagation of toxicity, focusing on conversation chains-structured reply patterns within podcast transcripts. Leveraging state-of-the-art transcription models and advanced conversational analysis techniques, we systematically examine toxic discourse in over 30 popular political podcasts in the United States. Our key contributions include: (1) creating a comprehensive dataset of transcribed and diarized political podcasts, identifying thousands of toxic instances using Google's Perspective API, (2) uncovering concerning trends where a majority of episodes contain at least one toxic instance, (3) introducing toxic conversation chains and analyzing their structural and linguistic properties, revealing characteristics such as longer durations, repetitive patterns, figurative language, and emotional cues tied to anger and annoyance, (4) identifying demand-related words like 'want', 'like', and 'know' as precursors to toxicity, and (5) developing predictive models to anticipate toxicity shifts based on annotated change points. Our findings provide critical insights into podcast toxicity and establish a foundation for future research on real-time monitoring and intervention mechanisms to foster healthier discourse in this influential medium.</description>

      <title>The potential -- and the pitfalls -- of using pre-trained language models as cognitive science theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many studies have evaluated the cognitive alignment of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), i.e., their correspondence to adult performance across a range of cognitive domains. Recently, the focus has expanded to the developmental alignment of these models: identifying phases during training where improvements in model performance track improvements in children's thinking over development. However, there are many challenges to the use of PLMs as cognitive science theories, including different architectures, different training data modalities and scales, and limited model interpretability. In this paper, we distill lessons learned from treating PLMs, not as engineering artifacts but as cognitive science and developmental science models. We review assumptions used by researchers to map measures of PLM performance to measures of human performance. We identify potential pitfalls of this approach to understanding human thinking, and we end by enumerating criteria for using PLMs as credible accounts of cognition and cognitive development.</description>

      <title>NBDI: A Simple and Efficient Termination Condition for Skill Extraction from Task-Agnostic Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent agents are able to make decisions based on different levels of granularity and duration. Recent advances in skill learning enabled the agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by effectively guiding the agent in choosing appropriate skills. However, the practice of using fixed-length skills can easily result in skipping valuable decision points, which ultimately limits the potential for further exploration and faster policy learning. In this work, we propose to learn a simple and efficient termination condition that identifies decision points through a state-action novelty module that leverages agent experience data. Our approach, Novelty-based Decision Point Identification (NBDI), outperforms previous baselines in complex, long-horizon tasks, and remains effective even in the presence of significant variations in the environment configurations of downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of decision point identification in skill learning.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning has shown impressive results obtained at the cost of training huge neural networks. However, the larger the architecture, the higher the computational, financial, and environmental costs during training and inference. We aim at reducing both training and inference durations. We focus on Neural Architecture Growth, which can increase the size of a small model when needed, directly during training using information from the backpropagation. We expand existing work and freely grow neural networks in the form of any Directed Acyclic Graph by reducing expressivity bottlenecks in the architecture. We explore strategies to reduce excessive computations and steer network growth toward more parameter-efficient architectures.</description>

      <title>HEPPO: Hardware-Efficient Proximal Policy Optimization -- A Universal Pipelined Architecture for Generalized Advantage Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces HEPPO, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to optimize the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) stage in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum federated learning and its experimental demonstration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is essential for decentralized, privacy-preserving model training in the data-driven era. Quantum-enhanced federated learning leverages quantum resources to address privacy and scalability challenges, offering security and efficiency advantages beyond classical methods. However, practical and scalable frameworks addressing privacy concerns in the quantum computing era remain undeveloped. Here, we propose a practical quantum federated learning framework on quantum networks, utilizing distributed quantum secret keys to protect local model updates and enable secure aggregation with information-theoretic security. We experimentally validate our framework on a 4-client quantum network with a scalable structure. Extensive numerical experiments on both quantum and classical datasets show that adding a quantum client significantly enhances the trained global model's ability to classify multipartite entangled and non-stabilizer quantum datasets. Simulations further demonstrate scalability to 200 clients with classical models trained on the MNIST dataset, reducing communication costs by $75\%$ through advanced model compression techniques and achieving rapid training convergence. Our work provides critical insights for building scalable, efficient, and quantum-secure machine learning systems for the coming quantum internet era.</description>

      <title>A Call for Critically Rethinking and Reforming Data Analysis in Empirical Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) drives innovation in SE through qualitative and quantitative studies. However, concerns about the correct application of empirical methodologies have existed since the 2006 Dagstuhl seminar on SE. Objective: To analyze three decades of SE research, identify mistakes in statistical methods, and evaluate experts' ability to detect and address these issues. Methods: We conducted a literature survey of ~27,000 empirical studies, using LLMs to classify statistical methodologies as adequate or inadequate. Additionally, we selected 30 primary studies and held a workshop with 33 ESE experts to assess their ability to identify and resolve statistical issues. Results: Significant statistical issues were found in the primary studies, and experts showed limited ability to detect and correct these methodological problems, raising concerns about the broader ESE community's proficiency in this area. Conclusions. Despite our study's eventual limitations, its results shed light on recurring issues from promoting information copy-and-paste from past authors' works and the continuous publication of inadequate approaches that promote dubious results and jeopardize the spread of the correct statistical strategies among researchers. Besides, it justifies further investigation into empirical rigor in software engineering to expose these recurring issues and establish a framework for reassessing our field's foundation of statistical methodology application. Therefore, this work calls for critically rethinking and reforming data analysis in empirical software engineering, paving the way for our work soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current LLM-based approaches improve question answering performance by leveraging the internal reasoning abilities of models or incorporating external knowledge. However, when humans address professional problems, it is essential to explicitly analyze the multifaceted relationships from multiple pieces and diverse sources of evidence to achieve better answers. In this study, we propose a novel generative question answering framework for the biomedical domain, named EvidenceMap, which explicitly learns and incorporates evidence analysis with small language models (SLMs). The framework describes an evidence map for each question and fully utilizes an SLM to derive the representation of the supportive evaluation, the logical correlation, and the summarization of the related evidence, which facilitates an analysis-augmented generation with another SLM in an autoregressive way. Extensive experiments have shown that introducing an evidence analysis learning process can significantly outperform larger models and popular LLM reasoning methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Conformal Prediction Threshold from Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a method to control prediction uncertainty by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a validation set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. Our solution is flexible and can accommodate various modeling assumptions regarding the label contamination process, without needing any information about the underlying data distribution or the internal mechanisms of the machine learning classifier. We develop a coverage guarantee for uniform noise that is effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP) and show on several natural and medical image classification datasets, including ImageNet, that it significantly outperforms current noisy label methods and achieves results comparable to those obtained with a clean validation set.</description>

      <title>NExtLong: Toward Effective Long-Context Training without Long Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have made significant strides yet remain a challenge due to the scarcity of long documents. Existing methods tend to synthesize long-context data but lack a clear mechanism to reinforce the long-range dependency modeling. To address this limitation, we propose NExtLong, a novel framework for synthesizing long-context data through Negative document Extension. NExtLong decomposes a document into multiple meta-chunks and extends the context by interleaving hard negative distractors retrieved from pretraining corpora. This approach compels the model to discriminate long-range dependent context from distracting content, enhancing its ability to model long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NExtLong achieves significant performance improvements on the HELMET and RULER benchmarks compared to existing long-context synthesis approaches and leading models, which are trained on non-synthetic long documents. These findings highlight NExtLong's ability to reduce reliance on non-synthetic long documents, making it an effective framework for developing advanced long-context LLMs.</description>

      <title>On Tradeoffs in Learning-Augmented Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of learning-augmented algorithms has gained significant attention in recent years. These algorithms, using potentially inaccurate predictions, must exhibit three key properties: consistency, robustness, and smoothness. In scenarios where distributional information about predictions is available, a strong expected performance is required. Typically, the design of these algorithms involves a natural tradeoff between consistency and robustness, and previous works aimed to achieve Pareto-optimal tradeoffs for specific problems. However, in some settings, this comes at the expense of smoothness. This paper demonstrates that certain problems involve multiple tradeoffs between consistency, robustness, smoothness, and average performance.</description>

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</description>

      <title>Revisit Self-Debugging with Self-Generated Tests for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in code generation, but still face challenges on tasks beyond their basic capabilities. Recently, the notion of self-debugging has been proposed to boost the performance of code generation by leveraging execution feedback from tests. Despite its promise, the availability of high-quality tests in real-world scenarios is limited. In this context, self-debugging with self-generated tests is a promising solution but lacks a full exploration of its limitations and practical potential. Therefore, we investigate its efficacy on diverse programming problems. To deepen our understanding, we propose two distinct paradigms for the process: post-execution and in-execution self-debugging. Within the scope of self-contained Python programming tasks, we find that post-execution self-debugging struggles on basic problems but shows potential for improvement on competitive ones, due to the bias introduced by self-generated tests. On the other hand, in-execution self-debugging enables LLMs to mitigate the bias by solely leveraging intermediate states during execution, thereby enhancing code generation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Modeling for Multi-order Human Visual Motion Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research aims to develop machines that learn to perceive visual motion as do humans. While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based models to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a significant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual system in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans' ability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order motion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the intensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT motion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and a recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic videos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings about first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion, inspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing pathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented using a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired the ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which pure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order mechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical fluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our dual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of moving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from non-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to perceive second-order motion, as can humans. The resulting model effectively aligns with biological systems while generalizing to both first- and second-order motion phenomena in natural scenes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Zero-Space Detection: A Novel Framework for Autonomous Ransomware Identification in High-Velocity Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cybersecurity landscapes increasingly demand sophisticated detection frameworks capable of identifying evolving threats with precision and adaptability. The proposed Zero-Space Detection framework introduces a novel approach that dynamically identifies latent behavioral patterns through unsupervised clustering and advanced deep learning techniques. Designed to address the limitations of signature-based and heuristic methods, it operates effectively in high-velocity environments by integrating multi-phase filtering and ensemble learning for refined decision-making. Experimental evaluation reveals high detection rates across diverse ransomware families, including LockBit, Conti, REvil, and BlackMatter, while maintaining low false positive rates and scalable performance. Computational overhead remains minimal, with average processing times ensuring compatibility with real-time systems even under peak operational loads. The framework demonstrates resilience against adversarial strategies such as obfuscation and encryption speed variability, which frequently challenge conventional detection systems. Analysis across multiple data sources highlights its versatility in handling diverse file types and operational contexts. Comprehensive metrics, including detection probability, latency, and resource efficiency, validate its efficacy under real-world conditions. Through its modular architecture, the framework achieves seamless integration with existing cybersecurity infrastructures without significant reconfiguration. The results demonstrate its robustness and scalability, offering a transformative paradigm for ransomware identification in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>To Measure or Not: A Cost-Sensitive, Selective Measuring Environment for Agricultural Management Decisions with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Farmers rely on in-field observations to make well-informed crop management decisions to maximize profit and minimize adverse environmental impact. However, obtaining real-world crop state measurements is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, it is not feasible to gather crop state measurements before every decision moment. Moreover, in previous research pertaining to farm management optimization, these observations are often assumed to be readily available without any cost, which is unrealistic. Hence, enabling optimization without the need to have temporally complete crop state observations is important. An approach to that problem is to include measuring as part of decision making. As a solution, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to recommend opportune moments to simultaneously measure crop features and apply nitrogen fertilizer. With realistic considerations, we design an RL environment with explicit crop feature measuring costs. While balancing costs, we find that an RL agent, trained with recurrent PPO, discovers adaptive measuring policies that follow critical crop development stages, with results aligned by what domain experts would consider a sensible approach. Our results highlight the importance of measuring when crop feature measurements are not readily available.</description>

      <title>Open or Closed LLM for Lesser-Resourced Languages? Lessons from Greek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for lesser-resourced languages faces persistent challenges, including limited datasets, inherited biases from high-resource languages, and the need for domain-specific solutions. This study addresses these gaps for Modern Greek through three key contributions. First, we evaluate the performance of open-source (Llama-70b) and closed-source (GPT-4o mini) large language models (LLMs) on seven core NLP tasks with dataset availability, revealing task-specific strengths, weaknesses, and parity in their performance. Second, we expand the scope of Greek NLP by reframing Authorship Attribution as a tool to assess potential data usage by LLMs in pre-training, with high 0-shot accuracy suggesting ethical implications for data provenance. Third, we showcase a legal NLP case study, where a Summarize, Translate, and Embed (STE) methodology outperforms the traditional TF-IDF approach for clustering \emph{long} legal texts. Together, these contributions provide a roadmap to advance NLP in lesser-resourced languages, bridging gaps in model evaluation, task innovation, and real-world impact.</description>

      <title>GAMED-Snake: Gradient-aware Adaptive Momentum Evolution Deep Snake Model for Multi-organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical yet challenging task due to complex anatomical backgrounds, blurred boundaries, and diverse morphologies. This study introduces the Gradient-aware Adaptive Momentum Evolution Deep Snake (GAMED-Snake) model, which establishes a novel paradigm for contour-based segmentation by integrating gradient-based learning with adaptive momentum evolution mechanisms. The GAMED-Snake model incorporates three major innovations: First, the Distance Energy Map Prior (DEMP) generates a pixel-level force field that effectively attracts contour points towards the true boundaries, even in scenarios with complex backgrounds and blurred edges. Second, the Differential Convolution Inception Module (DCIM) precisely extracts comprehensive energy gradients, significantly enhancing segmentation accuracy. Third, the Adaptive Momentum Evolution Mechanism (AMEM) employs cross-attention to establish dynamic features across different iterations of evolution, enabling precise boundary alignment for diverse morphologies. Experimental results on four challenging multi-organ segmentation datasets demonstrate that GAMED-Snake improves the mDice metric by approximately 2% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/SYSUzrc/GAMED-Snake.</description>

      <title>Mutation-Guided LLM-based Test Generation at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes Meta's ACH system for mutation-guided LLM-based test generation. ACH generates relatively few mutants (aka simulated faults), compared to traditional mutation testing. Instead, it focuses on generating currently undetected faults that are specific to an issue of concern. From these currently uncaught faults, ACH generates tests that can catch them, thereby `killing' the mutants and consequently hardening the platform against regressions. We use privacy concerns to illustrate our approach, but ACH can harden code against {\em any} type of regression. In total, ACH was applied to 10,795 Android Kotlin classes in 7 software platforms deployed by Meta, from which it generated 9,095 mutants and 571 privacy-hardening test cases. ACH also deploys an LLM-based equivalent mutant detection agent that achieves a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.47 (rising to 0.95 and 0.96 with simple pre-processing). ACH was used by Messenger and WhatsApp test-a-thons where engineers accepted 73% of its tests, judging 36% to privacy relevant. We conclude that ACH hardens code against specific concerns and that, even when its tests do not directly tackle the specific concern, engineers find them useful for their other benefits.</description>

      <title>As Confidence Aligns: Exploring the Effect of AI Confidence on Human Self-confidence in Human-AI Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complementary collaboration between humans and AI is essential for human-AI decision making. One feasible approach to achieving it involves accounting for the calibrated confidence levels of both AI and users. However, this process would likely be made more difficult by the fact that AI confidence may influence users' self-confidence and its calibration. To explore these dynamics, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that in human-AI decision-making, users' self-confidence aligns with AI confidence and such alignment can persist even after AI ceases to be involved. This alignment then affects users' self-confidence calibration. We also found the presence of real-time correctness feedback of decisions reduced the degree of alignment. These findings suggest that users' self-confidence is not independent of AI confidence, which practitioners aiming to achieve better human-AI collaboration need to be aware of. We call for research focusing on the alignment of human cognition and behavior with AI.</description>

      <title>Drone Carrier: An Integrated Unmanned Surface Vehicle for Autonomous Inspection and Intervention in GNSS-Denied Maritime Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative drone carrier concept that is applied in maritime port security or offshore rescue. This system works with a heterogeneous system consisting of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to perform inspection and intervention tasks in GNSS-denied or interrupted environments. The carrier, an electric catamaran measuring 4m by 7m, features a 4m by 6m deck supporting automated takeoff and landing for four DJI M300 drones, along with a 10kg-payload manipulator operable in up to level 3 sea conditions. Utilizing an offshore gimbal camera for navigation, the carrier can autonomously navigate, approach and dock with non-cooperative vessels, guided by an onboard camera, LiDAR, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over a 3 km$^2$ area. UAVs equipped with onboard Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology execute mapping, detection, and manipulation tasks using a versatile gripper designed for wet, saline conditions. Additionally, two UAVs can coordinate to transport large objects to the manipulator or interact directly with them. These procedures are fully automated and were successfully demonstrated at the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotic Competition (MBZIRC2024), where the drone carrier equipped with four UAVS and one manipulator, automatically accomplished the intervention tasks in sea-level-3 (wave height 1.25m) based on the rough target information.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning Based Automated Design of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is recognized as one of the most effective evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in black-box optimization due to its derivative-free nature. Numerous enhancements to the fundamental DE have been proposed, incorporating innovative mutation strategies and sophisticated parameter tuning techniques to improve performance. However, no single variant has proven universally superior across all problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design DE for black-box optimization through meta-learning. RL acts as an advanced meta-optimizer, generating a customized DE configuration that includes an optimal initialization strategy, update rule, and hyperparameters tailored to a specific black-box optimization problem. This process is informed by a detailed analysis of the problem characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize a double deep Q-network for implementation, considering a subset of 40 possible strategy combinations and parameter optimizations simultaneously. The framework's performance is evaluated against black-box optimization benchmarks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results highlight the promising potential of our proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk-based node embedding algorithms have attracted a lot of attention due to their scalability and ease of implementation. Previous research has focused on different walk strategies, optimization objectives, and embedding learning models. Inspired by observations on real data, we take a different approach and propose a new regularization technique. More precisely, the frequencies of node pairs generated by the skip-gram model on random walk node sequences follow a highly skewed distribution which causes learning to be dominated by a fraction of the pairs. We address the issue by designing an efficient sampling procedure that generates node pairs according to their {\em smoothed frequency}. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Architectural Fusion Through Contextual Partitioning in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Parameterized Knowledge Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual Partitioning introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the architectural design of large-scale computational models through the dynamic segmentation of parameters into context-aware regions. This methodology emphasizes the importance of task-specific specialization, achieved through adaptive parameter allocation mechanisms that align with the linguistic features of input data. Experimental evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements in accuracy, perplexity, and contextual coherence across a variety of linguistic tasks, highlighting the adaptability and scalability of the proposed framework. By reducing redundancy and enhancing computational efficiency, Contextual Partitioning not only streamlines model operations but also expands the scope of applications for advanced language processing systems. The approach operates autonomously, requiring no external fine-tuning, thereby addressing a significant limitation in conventional parameter optimization techniques. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient-driven segmentation, enabling models to dynamically recalibrate and specialize in response to task-specific demands. Furthermore, resource utilization metrics reveal notable reductions in memory usage and training times, confirming the efficiency of the approach. Observations from qualitative analyses illustrate improved contextual coherence and logical flow in generated outputs, reinforcing the practical value of this technique. The findings collectively demonstrate the potential for Contextual Partitioning to redefine the scalability and adaptability of computational language architectures in diverse and complex domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images as an artistic medium often rely on specific camera angles and lens distortions to convey ideas or emotions; however, such precise control is missing in current text-to-image models. We propose an efficient and general solution that allows precise control over the camera when generating both photographic and artistic images. Unlike prior methods that rely on predefined shots, we rely solely on four simple extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, removing the need for pre-existing geometry, reference 3D objects, and multi-view data. We also present a novel dataset with more than 57,000 images, along with their text prompts and ground-truth camera parameters. Our evaluation shows precise camera control in text-to-image generation, surpassing traditional prompt engineering approaches. Our data, model, and code are publicly available at https://graphics.unizar.es/projects/PreciseCam2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.</description>

      <title>GANQ: GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial resource requirements. While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>A Novel Tracking Framework for Devices in X-ray Leveraging Supplementary Cue-Driven Self-Supervised Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To restore proper blood flow in blocked coronary arteries via angioplasty procedure, accurate placement of devices such as catheters, balloons, and stents under live fluoroscopy or diagnostic angiography is crucial. Identified balloon markers help in enhancing stent visibility in X-ray sequences, while the catheter tip aids in precise navigation and co-registering vessel structures, reducing the need for contrast in angiography. However, accurate detection of these devices in interventional X-ray sequences faces significant challenges, particularly due to occlusions from contrasted vessels and other devices and distractions from surrounding, resulting in the failure to track such small objects. While most tracking methods rely on spatial correlation of past and current appearance, they often lack strong motion comprehension essential for navigating through these challenging conditions, and fail to effectively detect multiple instances in the scene. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that enhances its spatio-temporal understanding by incorporating supplementary cues and learning across multiple representation spaces on a large dataset. Followed by that, we introduce a generic real-time tracking framework that effectively leverages the pretrained spatio-temporal network and also takes the historical appearance and trajectory data into account. This results in enhanced localization of multiple instances of device landmarks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in interventional X-ray device tracking, especially stability and robustness, achieving an 87% reduction in max error for balloon marker detection and a 61% reduction in max error for catheter tip detection.</description>

      <title>It's complicated. The relationship of algorithmic fairness and non-discrimination regulations in the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for AI models, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First a high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.), most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.), the regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are often inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Regulations for General Purpose AI Models, such as Large Language Models that are not simultaneously classified as high-risk systems, currently lack specificity compared to other regulations. Based on these findings, we recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Accessible Smart Contracts Verification: Synthesizing Formal Models with Tamed LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When blockchain systems are said to be trustless, what this really means is that all the trust is put into software. Thus, there are strong incentives to ensure blockchain software is correct -- vulnerabilities here cost millions and break businesses. One of the most powerful ways of establishing software correctness is by using formal methods. Approaches based on formal methods, however, induce a significant overhead in terms of time and expertise required to successfully employ them. Our work addresses this critical disadvantage by automating the creation of a formal model -- a mathematical abstraction of the software system -- which is often a core task when employing formal methods. We perform model synthesis in three phases: we first transpile the code into model stubs; then we "fill in the blanks" using a large language model (LLM); finally, we iteratively repair the generated model, on both syntactical and semantical level. In this way, we significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to create formal models and increase accessibility of valuable software verification methods that rely on them. The practical context of our work was reducing the time-to-value of using formal models for correctness audits of smart contracts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to understanding Galois theory, one of the foundational areas of algebra, through the lens of machine learning. By analyzing polynomial equations with machine learning techniques, we aim to streamline the process of determining solvability by radicals and explore broader applications within Galois theory. This summary encapsulates the background, methodology, potential applications, and challenges of using data science in Galois theory.
  More specifically, we design a neurosymbolic network to classify Galois groups and show how this is more efficient than usual neural networks. We discover some very interesting distribution of polynomials for groups not isomorphic to the symmetric groups and alternating groups.</description>

      <title>FlanEC: Exploring Flan-T5 for Post-ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an encoder-decoder model leveraging Flan-T5 for post-Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Generative Speech Error Correction (GenSEC), and we refer to it as FlanEC. We explore its application within the GenSEC framework to enhance ASR outputs by mapping n-best hypotheses into a single output sentence. By utilizing n-best lists from ASR models, we aim to improve the linguistic correctness, accuracy, and grammaticality of final ASR transcriptions. Specifically, we investigate whether scaling the training data and incorporating diverse datasets can lead to significant improvements in post-ASR error correction. We evaluate FlanEC using the HyPoradise dataset, providing a comprehensive analysis of the model's effectiveness in this domain. Furthermore, we assess the proposed approach under different settings to evaluate model scalability and efficiency, offering valuable insights into the potential of instruction-tuned encoder-decoder models for this task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of rank of a Boolean function has been a cornerstone in the theory of PAC learning, enabling quasipolynomial-time learning algorithms for polynomial-size decision trees. We present a novel characterization of rank, grounded in the well-known Transformer architecture. We show that the rank of a function $f$ corresponds to the minimum number of Chain of Thought (CoT) steps required by a single-layer transformer decoder with hard attention to compute $f$. Based on this characterization we establish tight bounds on the number of CoT steps required for specific problems, showing that $\ell$-fold function composition necessitates exactly $\ell$ CoT steps. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of identifying the position of the $k$-th occurrence of 1 in a Boolean sequence, proving that it requires $k$ CoT steps.</description>

      <title>MONA: Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval Can Mitigate Multi-step Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future advanced AI systems may learn sophisticated strategies through reinforcement learning (RL) that humans cannot understand well enough to safely evaluate. We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.</description>

      <title>Paper Quality Assessment based on Individual Wisdom Metrics from Open Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a data-driven framework for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of scientific peer review through an open, bottom-up process that estimates reviewer quality. Traditional closed peer review systems, while essential for quality control, are often slow, costly, and subject to biases that can impede scientific progress. Here, we introduce a method that evaluates individual reviewer reliability by quantifying agreement with community consensus scores and applying Bayesian weighting to refine paper quality assessments. We analyze open peer review data from two major scientific conferences, and demonstrate that reviewer-specific quality scores significantly improve the reliability of paper quality estimation. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that reviewer quality scores are unrelated to authorship quality. Our model incorporates incentive structures to recognize high-quality reviewers and encourage broader coverage of submitted papers, thereby mitigating the common "rich-get-richer" pitfall of social media. These findings suggest that open peer review, with mechanisms for estimating and incentivizing reviewer quality, offers a scalable and equitable alternative for scientific publishing, with potential to enhance the speed, fairness, and transparency of the peer review process.</description>

      <title>Provably-Safe Neural Network Training Using Hybrid Zonotope Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. Towards addressing this, many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, but do not address how to correct an "unsafe" network. On the other hand, the few works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To address these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact reachable set of a non-convex input set through a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region, using recent results in non-convex set representation with hybrid zonotopes and extracting gradient information from mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method is fast, with the computational complexity of each training iteration comparable to that of solving a linear program (LP) with number of dimensions and constraints linear to the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. For a neural network with three hidden layers of width 30, the method was able to drive the reachable set of a non-convex input set with 55 generators and 26 constraints out of a non-convex unsafe region with 21 generators and 11 constraints in 490 seconds.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Return Distributions with Distributional Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond expected utilities, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained so far (since the first time step). We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we combine the core ideas of distributional value iteration with the deep RL agent DQN, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.</description>

      <title>AdaWM: Adaptive World Model based Planning for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems.</description>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use a router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the router's decision-making and the experts' execution is a critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), a novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency.</description>

      <title>Attention-Driven Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Particle Filtering for Source Localization in Dynamic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as gas leak detection or environmental pollutant tracking, solving the Inverse Source Localization and Characterization problem involves navigating complex, dynamic fields with sparse and noisy observations. Traditional methods face significant challenges, including partial observability, temporal and spatial dynamics, out-of-distribution generalization, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning. The framework leverages an attention-enhanced particle filtering mechanism for efficient and accurate belief updates, and incorporates two complementary execution strategies: Attention Particle Filtering Planning and Attention Particle Filtering Reinforcement Learning. These approaches optimize exploration and adaptation under uncertainty. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the attention-enhanced particle filter, while extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the framework's superior accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the framework's potential for broad applications in dynamic field estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Recovery of Unambiguous Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</description>

      <title>Robust Representation Consistency Model via Contrastive Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

      <title>The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process, which introduces focalism. This trade-off between unconfoundedness and ecological validity is usually absent in traditional experimental design and represents a unique challenge in LLM simulations. We formalize this challenge theoretically, showing it stems from ambiguous prompting strategies, and hence cannot be fully addressed by improving training data or by fine-tuning. Alternative approaches that unblind the experimental design to the LLM show promise. Our findings suggest that effectively leveraging LLMs for experimental simulations requires fundamentally rethinking established experimental design practices rather than simply adapting protocols developed for human subjects.</description>

      <title>Distributional Counterfactual Explanations With Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13112v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CE) are the de facto method for providing insights into black-box decision-making models by identifying alternative inputs that lead to different outcomes. However, existing CE approaches, including group and global methods, focus predominantly on specific input modifications, lacking the ability to capture nuanced distributional characteristics that influence model outcomes across the entire input-output spectrum. This paper proposes distributional counterfactual explanation (DCE), shifting focus to the distributional properties of observed and counterfactual data, thus providing broader insights. DCE is particularly beneficial for stakeholders making strategic decisions based on statistical data analysis, as it makes the statistical distribution of the counterfactual resembles the one of the factual when aligning model outputs with a target distribution\textemdash something that the existing CE methods cannot fully achieve. We leverage optimal transport (OT) to formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem, deriving a counterfactual distribution aligned with its factual counterpart, supported by statistical confidence. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through experiments, highlighting its potential to provide deeper insights into decision-making models.</description>

      <title>Learning To Guide Human Decision Makers With Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in developing AIs for assisting human decision-making in high-stakes tasks, such as medical diagnosis, for the purpose of improving decision quality and reducing cognitive strain. Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention. his separation of responsibilities setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions due to anchoring bias, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained. As a remedy, we introduce learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which - rather than taking control from the human expert - the machine provides guidance useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. In order to ensure guidance is interpretable} and task-specific, we develop SLOG, an approach for turning any vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback. Our empirical evaluation highlights the promise of \method on a challenging, real-world medical diagnosis task.</description>

      <title>Grammar-based Game Description Generation using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game Description Language (GDL) provides a standardized way to express diverse games in a machine-readable format, enabling automated game simulation, and evaluation. While previous research has explored game description generation using search-based methods, generating GDL descriptions from natural language remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate grammatically accurate game descriptions from natural language. Our approach consists of two stages: first, we gradually generate a minimal grammar based on GDL specifications; second, we iteratively improve the game description through grammar-guided generation. Our framework employs a specialized parser that identifies valid subsequences and candidate symbols from LLM responses, enabling gradual refinement of the output to ensure grammatical correctness. Experimental results demonstrate that our iterative improvement approach significantly outperforms baseline methods that directly use LLM outputs.

      <title>AI-driven View Guidance System in Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE) is a crucial imaging modality used in electrophysiology (EP) and structural heart disease (SHD) interventions, providing realtime, high-resolution views from within the heart. Despite its advantages, effective manipulation of the ICE catheter requires significant expertise, which can lead to inconsistent outcomes, especially among less experienced operators. To address this challenge, we propose an AIdriven view guidance system that operates in a continuous closed-loop with human-in-the-loop feedback, designed to assist users in navigating ICE imaging without requiring specialized knowledge. Specifically, our method models the relative position and orientation vectors between arbitrary views and clinically defined ICE views in a spatial coordinate system. It guides users on how to manipulate the ICE catheter to transition from the current view to the desired view over time. By operating in a closedloop configuration, the system continuously predicts and updates the necessary catheter manipulations, ensuring seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through a simulation-based performance evaluation using real clinical data, achieving an 89% success rate with 6,532 test cases. Additionally, a semi-simulation experiment with human-in-the-loop testing validated the feasibility of continuous yet discrete guidance. These results underscore the potential of the proposed method to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ICE imaging procedures.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Training of Diffusion Models for Feasible Solution Generation in Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising results in generating near-optimal solutions without the need for expert-crafted heuristics. However, high performance of these approaches often rely on problem-specific human-expertise-based search after generating candidate solutions, limiting their applicability to commonly solved CO problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper, we present IC/DC, an unsupervised CO framework that directly trains a diffusion model from scratch. We train our model in a self-supervised way to minimize the cost of the solution while adhering to the problem-specific constraints. IC/DC is specialized in addressing CO problems involving two distinct sets of items, and it does not need problem-specific search processes to generate valid solutions. IC/DC employs a novel architecture capable of capturing the intricate relationships between items, and thereby enabling effective optimization in challenging CO scenarios. IC/DC achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to existing NCO methods on the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP) and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).</description>

      <title>Reasoning Language Models: A Blueprint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-V3, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM development and experimentation.</description>

      <title>Episodic memory in AI agents poses risks that should be studied and mitigated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most current AI models have little ability to store and later retrieve a record or representation of what they do. In human cognition, episodic memories play an important role in both recall of the past as well as planning for the future. The ability to form and use episodic memories would similarly enable a broad range of improved capabilities in an AI agent that interacts with and takes actions in the world. Researchers have begun directing more attention to developing memory abilities in AI models. It is therefore likely that models with such capability will be become widespread in the near future. This could in some ways contribute to making such AI agents safer by enabling users to better monitor, understand, and control their actions. However, as a new capability with wide applications, we argue that it will also introduce significant new risks that researchers should begin to study and address. We outline these risks and benefits and propose four principles to guide the development of episodic memory capabilities so that these will enhance, rather than undermine, the effort to keep AI safe and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Systematic Abductive Reasoning via Diverse Relation Representations in Vector-symbolic Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In abstract visual reasoning, monolithic deep learning models suffer from limited interpretability and generalization, while existing neuro-symbolic approaches fall short in capturing the diversity and systematicity of attributes and relation representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Systematic Abductive Reasoning model with diverse relation representations (Rel-SAR) in Vector-symbolic Architecture (VSA) to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). To derive attribute representations with symbolic reasoning potential, we introduce not only various types of atomic vectors that represent numeric, periodic and logical semantics, but also the structured high-dimentional representation (SHDR) for the overall Grid component. For systematic reasoning, we propose novel numerical and logical relation functions and perform rule abduction and execution in a unified framework that integrates these relation representations. Experimental results demonstrate that Rel-SAR achieves significant improvement on RPM tasks and exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization. Rel-SAR leverages the synergy between HD attribute representations and symbolic reasoning to achieve systematic abductive reasoning with both interpretable and computable semantics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of combinatorial multiarmed bandits with stochastic submodular (in expectation) rewards and full-bandit delayed feedback, where the delayed feedback is assumed to be composite and anonymous. In other words, the delayed feedback is composed of components of rewards from past actions, with unknown division among the sub-components. Three models of delayed feedback: bounded adversarial, stochastic independent, and stochastic conditionally independent are studied, and regret bounds are derived for each of the delay models. Ignoring the problem dependent parameters, we show that regret bound for all the delay models is $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3} + T^{1/3} \nu)$ for time horizon $T$, where $\nu$ is a delay parameter defined differently in the three cases, thus demonstrating an additive term in regret with delay in all the three delay models. The considered algorithm is demonstrated to outperform other full-bandit approaches with delayed composite anonymous feedback.</description>

In this context, recent approaches have employed the Masked Image Modeling paradigm, which pre-trains a backbone by reconstructing visual tokens associated with randomly masked image patches. This masking approach, however, introduces noise into the input data during pre-training, leading to discrepancies that can impair performance during the fine-tuning phase. Furthermore, input masking neglects the dependencies between corrupted patches, increasing the inconsistencies observed in downstream fine-tuning tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach, named Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT), that employs autoregressive and permuted predictions to capture intra-patch dependencies. In addition, MaPeT employs auxiliary positional information to reduce the disparity between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In our experiments, we employ a fair setting to ensure reliable and meaningful comparisons and conduct investigations on multiple visual tokenizers, including our proposed $k$-CLIP which directly employs discretized CLIP features. Our results demonstrate that MaPeT achieves competitive performance on ImageNet, compared to baselines and competitors under the same model setting. We release an implementation of our code and models at https://github.com/aimagelab/MaPeT.</description>

      <title>ChoiceMates: Supporting Unfamiliar Online Decision-Making with Multi-Agent Conversational Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From deciding on a PhD program to buying a new camera, unfamiliar decisions--decisions without domain knowledge--are frequent and significant. The complexity and uncertainty of such decisions demand unique approaches to information seeking, understanding, and decision-making. Our formative study highlights that users want to start by discovering broad and relevant domain information evenly and simultaneously, quickly address emerging inquiries, and gain personalized standards to assess information found. We present ChoiceMates, an interactive multi-agent system designed to address these needs by enabling users to engage with a dynamic set of LLM agents each presenting a unique experience in the domain. Unlike existing multi-agent systems that automate tasks with agents, the user orchestrates agents to assist their decision-making process. Our user evaluation (n=12) shows that ChoiceMates enables a more confident, satisfactory decision-making with better situation understanding than web search, and higher decision quality and confidence than a commercial multi-agent framework. This work provides insights into designing a more controllable and collaborative multi-agent system.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sequential Decision-Making in Geosteering: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a refined complexity-theoretic analysis of three classical problems in the context of Hierarchical Task Network Planning: the verification of a provided plan, whether an executable plan exists, and whether a given state can be reached. Our focus lies on identifying structural properties which yield tractability. We obtain new polynomial algorithms for all three problems on a natural class of primitive networks, along with corresponding lower bounds. We also obtain an algorithmic meta-theorem for lifting polynomial-time solvability from primitive to general task networks, and prove that its preconditions are tight. Finally, we analyze the parameterized complexity of the three problems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing textual textbook question answering with large language models and retrieval augmented generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textbook question answering (TQA) is a challenging task in artificial intelligence due to the complex nature of context needed to answer complex questions. Although previous research has improved the task, there are still some limitations in textual TQA, including weak reasoning and inability to capture contextual information in the lengthy context. We propose a framework (PLRTQA) that incorporates the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to handle the out-of-domain scenario where concepts are spread across different lessons, and utilize transfer learning to handle the long context and enhance reasoning abilities. Our architecture outperforms the baseline, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4. 12% in the validation set and 9. 84% in the test set for textual multiple-choice questions. While this paper focuses on solving challenges in the textual TQA, It provides a foundation for future work in multimodal TQA where the visual components are integrated to address more complex educational scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2402.10528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has marked a significant advancement in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have developed various extensions of CoT, which focus primarily on enhancing end-task performance. In addition, there has been research on assessing the quality of reasoning chains in CoT. This raises an intriguing question: Is it possible to predict the accuracy of LLM outputs by scrutinizing the reasoning chains they generate? To answer this research question, we introduce a benchmark, R2PE, designed specifically to explore the relationship between reasoning chains and performance in various reasoning tasks spanning five different domains. This benchmark aims to measure the falsehood of the final output of LLMs based on the reasoning steps. To make full use of information in multiple reasoning chains, we propose the process discernibility score (PDS) framework that beats the answer-checking baseline by a large margin. Concretely, this resulted in an average of $5.1\%$ increase in the F1 score and $2.97\%$ improvement in AUC-PR across all 45 subsets within R2PE. We further demonstrate our PDS's efficacy in advancing open-domain QA accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation through Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems operate under the assumption that training and test data are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. However, this assumptions is rarely verified in practice, as the conditions upon which data was acquired are likely to change. In this context, the adaptation of the unsupervised domain requires minimal access to the data of the new conditions for learning models robust to changes in the data distribution. Optimal transport is a theoretically grounded tool for analyzing changes in distribution, especially as it allows the mapping between domains. However, these methods are usually computationally expensive as their complexity scales cubically with the number of samples. In this work, we explore optimal transport between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which is conveniently written in terms of the components of source and target GMMs. We experiment with 9 benchmarks, with a total of $85$ adaptation tasks, showing that our methods are more efficient than previous shallow domain adaptation methods, and they scale well with number of samples $n$ and dimensions $d$.</description>

      <title>Make VLM Recognize Visual Hallucination on Cartoon Character Image with Pose Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common technique for generating exemplar or training dataset in the fields of image synthesis, video editing, 3D reconstruction. However, semantic structural visual hallucinations involving perceptually severe defects remain a concern, especially in the domain of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) such as cartoons and pixelization-style character. To detect these hallucinations in NPR, We propose a novel semantic structural hallucination detection system using Vision-Language Model (VLM). Our approach is to leverage the emerging capability of large language model, in-context learning which denotes that VLM has seen some examples by user for specific downstream task, here hallucination detection. Based on in-context learning, we introduce pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) which improve the overall performance of VLM by further inputting visual data beyond prompts, RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. Within selected two VLMs, GPT-4v, Gemini pro vision, our proposed PA-ICVL improves the hallucination detection with 50% to 78%, 57% to 80%, respectively. This research advances a capability of TTI models toward real-world applications by mitigating visual hallucinations via in-context visual learning, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains. In addition, it showcase how users can boost the downstream-specialized capability of open VLM by harnessing additional conditions. We collect synthetic cartoon-hallucination dataset with TTI models, this dataset and final tuned VLM will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>UrbanVLP: Multi-Granularity Vision-Language Pretraining for Urban Socioeconomic Indicator Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban socioeconomic indicator prediction aims to infer various metrics related to sustainable development in diverse urban landscapes using data-driven methods. However, prevalent pretrained models, particularly those reliant on satellite imagery, face dual challenges. Firstly, concentrating solely on macro-level patterns from satellite data may introduce bias, lacking nuanced details at micro levels, such as architectural details at a place. Secondly, the text generated by the precursor work UrbanCLIP, which fully utilizes the extensive knowledge of LLMs, frequently exhibits issues such as hallucination and homogenization, resulting in a lack of reliable quality. In response to these issues, we devise a novel framework entitled UrbanVLP based on Vision-Language Pretraining. Our UrbanVLP seamlessly integrates multi-granularity information from both macro (satellite) and micro (street-view) levels, overcoming the limitations of prior pretrained models. Moreover, it introduces automatic text generation and calibration, providing a robust guarantee for producing high-quality text descriptions of urban imagery. Rigorous experiments conducted across six socioeconomic indicator prediction tasks underscore its superior performance.</description>

      <title>GREEN: Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating radiology reports is a challenging problem as factual correctness is extremely important due to the need for accurate medical communication about medical images. Existing automatic evaluation metrics either suffer from failing to consider factual correctness (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or are limited in their interpretability (e.g., F1CheXpert and F1RadGraph). In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation), a radiology report generation metric that leverages the natural language understanding of language models to identify and explain clinically significant errors in candidate reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to current metrics, GREEN offers: 1) a score aligned with expert preferences, 2) human interpretable explanations of clinically significant errors, enabling feedback loops with end-users, and 3) a lightweight open-source method that reaches the performance of commercial counterparts. We validate our GREEN metric by comparing it to GPT-4, as well as to error counts of 6 experts and preferences of 2 experts. Our method demonstrates not only higher correlation with expert error counts, but simultaneously higher alignment with expert preferences when compared to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem. Our code will be released at https: //github.com/zblasingame/AdjointDEIS.</description>

      <title>Explainability of Machine Learning Models under Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue that can significantly impair model performance and explainability. This paper briefly summarizes the development of the field of missing data with respect to Explainable Artificial Intelligence and experimentally investigates the effects of various imputation methods on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a popular technique for explaining the output of complex machine learning models. Next, we compare different imputation strategies and assess their impact on feature importance and interaction as determined by Shapley values. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze the effects of missing values on Shapley values. Importantly, our findings reveal that the choice of imputation method can introduce biases that could lead to changes in the Shapley values, thereby affecting the explainability of the model. Moreover, we also show that a lower test prediction MSE (Mean Square Error) does not necessarily imply a lower MSE in Shapley values and vice versa. Also, while XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a method that could handle missing data directly, using XGBoost directly on missing data can seriously affect explainability compared to imputing the data before training XGBoost. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of imputation methods in the context of model explanations, offering practical guidance for selecting appropriate techniques based on dataset characteristics and analysis objectives. The results underscore the importance of considering imputation effects to ensure robust and reliable insights from machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use cases, such as automated personal assistants that adapt to the user's unique data and demands. Two key requirements for such assistants are personalization - in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may prefer to always store their personal data locally, on their own computing device. In this application paper, we present a new design and evaluation for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be trained and deployed locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized to the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a combination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions technique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate that this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to better reflect a user's writing style using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g. on a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is what we believe to be the first detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task, and of how different choices of system components - e.g. the use of RAG and of different fine-tuning approaches - impact the system's performance. We are releasing the full Panza code as well as a new "David" personalized email dataset licensed for research use, both available on https://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has underscored the urgent need for responsible AI practices. Despite increasing interest, a comprehensive AI risk assessment toolkit remains lacking. This study introduces our Responsible AI (RAI) Question Bank, a comprehensive framework and tool designed to support diverse AI initiatives. By integrating AI ethics principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability into a structured question format, the RAI Question Bank aids in identifying potential risks, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, and enhancing overall AI governance. A key benefit of the RAI Question Bank is its systematic approach to linking lower-level risk questions to higher-level ones and related themes, preventing siloed assessments and ensuring a cohesive evaluation process. Case studies illustrate the practical application of the RAI Question Bank in assessing AI projects, from evaluating risk factors to informing decision-making processes. The study also demonstrates how the RAI Question Bank can be used to ensure compliance with standards, mitigate risks, and promote the development of trustworthy AI systems. This work advances RAI by providing organizations with a valuable tool to navigate the complexities of ethical AI development and deployment while ensuring comprehensive risk management.</description>

      <title>Open-MAGVIT2: An Open-Source Project Toward Democratizing Auto-regressive Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Open-MAGVIT2, a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B. The Open-MAGVIT2 project produces an open-source replication of Google's MAGVIT-v2 tokenizer, a tokenizer with a super-large codebook (i.e., $2^{18}$ codes), and achieves the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance (1.17 rFID) on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Furthermore, we explore its application in plain auto-regressive models and validate scalability properties. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce "next sub-token prediction" to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. We release all models and codes to foster innovation and creativity in the field of auto-regressive visual generation.</description>

      <title>Introducing Perturb-ability Score (PS) to Enhance Robustness Against Problem-Space Evasion Adversarial Attacks on Flow-based ML-NIDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations.</description>

      <title>Label Convergence: Defining an Upper Performance Bound in Object Recognition through Contradictory Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Annotation errors are a challenge not only during training of machine learning models, but also during their evaluation. Label variations and inaccuracies in datasets often manifest as contradictory examples that deviate from established labeling conventions. Such inconsistencies, when significant, prevent models from achieving optimal performance on metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP). We introduce the notion of "label convergence" to describe the highest achievable performance under the constraint of contradictory test annotations, essentially defining an upper bound on model accuracy.
  Recognizing that noise is an inherent characteristic of all data, our study analyzes five real-world datasets, including the LVIS dataset, to investigate the phenomenon of label convergence. We approximate that label convergence is between 62.63-67.52 mAP@[0.5:0.95:0.05] for LVIS with 95% confidence, attributing these bounds to the presence of real annotation errors. With current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models at the upper end of the label convergence interval for the well-studied LVIS dataset, we conclude that model capacity is sufficient to solve current object detection problems. Therefore, future efforts should focus on three key aspects: (1) updating the problem specification and adjusting evaluation practices to account for unavoidable label noise, (2) creating cleaner data, especially test data, and (3) including multi-annotated data to investigate annotation variation and make these issues visible from the outset.</description>

      <title>T3: A Novel Zero-shot Transfer Learning Framework Iteratively Training on an Assistant Task for a Target Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long text summarization, gradually being essential for efficiently processing large volumes of information, stays challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA families because of the insufficient open-sourced training datasets and the high requirement of contextual details dealing. To address the issue, we design a novel zero-shot transfer learning framework, abbreviated as T3, to iteratively training a baseline LLM on an assistant task for the target task, where the former should own richer data resources and share structural or semantic similarity with the latter. In practice, T3 is approached to deal with the long text summarization task by utilizing question answering as the assistant task, and further validated its effectiveness on the BBC summary, NarraSum, FairytaleQA, and NLQuAD datasets, with up to nearly 14% improvement in ROUGE, 35% improvement in BLEU, and 16% improvement in Factscore compared to three baseline LLMs, demonstrating its potential for more assistant-target task combinations.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Zero-shot Lossless Gradient Compressors: Towards General Neural Parameter Prior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10% up to 17.2% across various datasets and architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. Code is available at https://github.com/hui-po-wang/LM-GC.</description>

      <title>O(d/T) Convergence Theory for Diffusion Probabilistic Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise, have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. Moreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate improves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data distribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image distributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experience replay is widely used to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by leveraging past experiences. However, existing experience replay methods, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, often suffer from low efficiency, particularly in real-world scenarios with high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay (EDER). EDER employs a deterministic point process to model the diversity between samples and prioritizes replay based on the diversity between samples. To further enhance learning efficiency, we incorporate Cholesky decomposition for handling large state spaces in realistic environments. Additionally, rejection sampling is applied to select samples with higher diversity, thereby improving overall learning efficacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on robotic manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic indoor environments in Habitat. The results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also achieves superior performance in high-dimensional, realistic environments.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of White-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To help MLOps engineers decide which operator to use in which deployment scenario, this study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs latency trade-off of white-box (training-based) and black-box operators (non-training-based) and their combinations in an Edge AI setup. We perform inference experiments including 3 white-box (i.e., QAT, Pruning, Knowledge Distillation), 2 black-box (i.e., Partition, SPTQ), and their combined operators (i.e., Distilled SPTQ, SPTQ Partition) across 3 tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) on 4 commonly-used Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing models to identify the effective strategies, considering the perspective of MLOps Engineers. Our Results indicate that the combination of Distillation and SPTQ operators (i.e., DSPTQ) should be preferred over non-hybrid operators when lower latency is required in the edge at small to medium accuracy drop. Among the non-hybrid operators, the Distilled operator is a better alternative in both mobile and edge tiers for lower latency performance at the cost of small to medium accuracy loss. Moreover, the operators involving distillation show lower latency in resource-constrained tiers (Mobile, Edge) compared to the operators involving Partitioning across Mobile and Edge tiers. For textual subject models, which have low input data size requirements, the Cloud tier is a better alternative for the deployment of operators than the Mobile, Edge, or Mobile-Edge tier (the latter being used for operators involving partitioning). In contrast, for image-based subject models, which have high input data size requirements, the Edge tier is a better alternative for operators than Mobile, Edge, or their combination.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of SLAM-ASR: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Way Forward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that training a linear connector between speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLMs) enables this architecture to achieve strong ASR capabilities. Despite the impressive results, it remains unclear whether these simple approaches are robust enough across different scenarios and speech conditions, such as domain shifts and speech perturbations. In this paper, we address these questions by conducting various ablation experiments using a recent and widely adopted approach called SLAM-ASR. We present novel empirical findings that offer insights on how to effectively utilize the SLAM-ASR architecture across a wide range of settings. Our main findings indicate that SLAM-ASR exhibits poor performance in cross-domain evaluation settings. Additionally, speech perturbations on in-domain data, such as changes in speech rate or additive noise, can significantly degrade performance. Our findings offer critical insights for fine-tuning and configuring robust LLM-based ASR models, tailored to different data characteristics and computational resources.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Approach for REST API Testing with Semantic Graphs and LLM-Driven Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern web services increasingly rely on REST APIs, their thorough testing has become crucial. Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation languages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property dependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency, parameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest on 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which generates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation study illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest -- the SPDG, the LLM, and the agent-learning mechanism -- contributes to its overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Developer Perspectives on Licensing and Copyright Issues Arising from Generative AI for Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools have already started to transform software development practices. Despite their utility in tasks such as writing code, the use of these tools raises important legal questions and potential risks, particularly those associated with copyright law. In the midst of this uncertainty, this paper presents a study jointly conducted by software engineering and legal researchers that surveyed 574 GitHub developers who use GenAI tools for development activities. The survey and follow-up interviews probed the developers' opinions on emerging legal issues as well as their perception of copyrightability, ownership of generated code, and related considerations. We also investigate potential developer misconceptions, the impact of GenAI on developers' work, and developers' awareness of licensing/copyright risks. Qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that developers' opinions on copyright issues vary broadly and that many developers are aware of the nuances these legal questions involve. We provide: (1) a survey of 574 developers on the licensing and copyright aspects of GenAI for coding, (2) a snapshot of practitioners' views at a time when GenAI and perceptions of it are rapidly evolving, and (3) an analysis of developers' views, yielding insights and recommendations that can inform future regulatory decisions in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving fair prediction performance across nodes is crucial in the spatial-temporal domain, as it ensures the validity and reliability of forecasting outcomes. However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</description>

      <title>Yi-Lightning Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01253v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</description>

      <title>Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06651v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Inference Optimization Techniques for Mixture of Experts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering enhanced model capacity and computational efficiency through conditional computation. However, deploying and running inference on these models presents significant challenges in computational resources, latency, and energy efficiency. This comprehensive survey analyzes optimization techniques for MoE models across the entire system stack. We first establish a taxonomical framework that categorizes optimization approaches into model-level, system-level, and hardware-level optimizations. At the model level, we examine architectural innovations including efficient expert design, attention mechanisms, various compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, as well as algorithm improvement including dynamic routing strategies and expert merging methods. At the system level, we investigate distributed computing approaches, load balancing mechanisms, and efficient scheduling algorithms that enable scalable deployment. Furthermore, we delve into hardware-specific optimizations and co-design strategies that maximize throughput and energy efficiency. This survey provides both a structured overview of existing solutions and identifies key challenges and promising research directions in MoE inference optimization. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge advances in MoE inference optimization research, we have established a repository accessible at https://github.com/MoE-Inf/awesome-moe-inference/.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/tifat58/IRR-with-CBM-RAG.git.</description>

      <title>RAG with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide \emph{Large Language Models} (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</description>

      <title>Design Optimizer for Soft Growing Robot Manipulators in Three-Dimensional Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length. In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$. Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results. By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help combat misinformation.</description>

      <title>Not all tokens are created equal: Perplexity Attention Weighted Networks for AI generated text detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts. It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.</description>

      <title>Robust Counterfactual Explanations under Model Multiplicity Using Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, explainability in machine learning has gained importance. In this context, counterfactual explanation (CE), which is an explanation method that uses examples, has attracted attention. However, it has been pointed out that CE is not robust when there are multiple machine-learning models. These problems are important when using machine learning to make safe decisions. In this paper, we propose robust CEs that introduce a new viewpoint - Pareto improvement - and a method that uses multi-objective optimization to generate it. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and actual data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and useful. We believe that this research will contribute to a wide range of research areas, such as explainability in machine learning, decision-making, and action planning based on machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of languages. However, efficacy can differ greatly between different language families, especially for those with limited linguistic resources. This report presents MERaLiON-TextLLM, a series of open-source language models specifically tailored to improve understanding and generation in Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, and Singlish. The initial released model is built on Llama-3-8B-Base and refined through a meticulously crafted process of continued pre-training and weight merging. Our approach achieves performance improvements across benchmarks in these languages, exceeding the capabilities of the official Llama-3 models. We provide the model checkpoints as a resource to support further research and development in cross-lingual language understanding.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Sim-to-Real Legged Instructive Manipulation via Long-Horizon Visuomotor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but operates in a more efficient way, at 1.5 times the speed of human expert. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</description>

      <title>SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</description>

      <title>ArxEval: Evaluating Retrieval and Generation in Language Models for Scientific Literature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models [LMs] are now playing an increasingly large role in information generation and synthesis; the representation of scientific knowledge in these systems needs to be highly accurate. A prime challenge is hallucination; that is, generating apparently plausible but actually false information, including invented citations and nonexistent research papers. This kind of inaccuracy is dangerous in all the domains that require high levels of factual correctness, such as academia and education. This work presents a pipeline for evaluating the frequency with which language models hallucinate in generating responses in the scientific literature. We propose ArxEval, an evaluation pipeline with two tasks using ArXiv as a repository: Jumbled Titles and Mixed Titles. Our evaluation includes fifteen widely used language models and provides comparative insights into their reliability in handling scientific literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/14622048.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models. The collection of DMAD research papers and resources is available at https://github.com/fdjingliu/DMAD.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Knowledge Graph: A Survey of Domains, Tasks, and Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as powerful tools for organizing and leveraging the vast and complex data found across the biomedical field. Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains or methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological progress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a systematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and applications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data sources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and clinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs, focusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation. Finally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of BKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified framework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but also establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative methodological advances and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>StAyaL | Multilingual Style Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stylistic text generation plays a vital role in enhancing communication by reflecting the nuances of individual expression. This paper presents a novel approach for generating text in a specific speaker's style across different languages. We show that by leveraging only 100 lines of text, an individuals unique style can be captured as a high-dimensional embedding, which can be used for both text generation and stylistic translation. This methodology breaks down the language barrier by transferring the style of a speaker between languages. The paper is structured into three main phases: augmenting the speaker's data with stylistically consistent external sources, separating style from content using machine learning and deep learning techniques, and generating an abstract style profile by mean pooling the learned embeddings. The proposed approach is shown to be topic-agnostic, with test accuracy and F1 scores of 74.9% and 0.75, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of the style profile for multilingual communication, paving the way for further applications in personalized content generation and cross-linguistic stylistic transfer.</description>

      <title>Web vs. LLMs: An Empirical Study of Learning Behaviors of CS2 Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs such as ChatGPT have been widely adopted by students in higher education as tools for learning programming and related concepts. However, it remains unclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while learning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online self-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating AI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods research, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how CS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional online methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students approach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students found it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods than using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use more keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend to explicitly ask for information.</description>

      <title>MeshONet: A Generalizable and Efficient Operator Learning Method for Structured Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesh generation plays a crucial role in scientific computing. Traditional mesh generation methods, such as TFI and PDE-based methods, often struggle to achieve a balance between efficiency and mesh quality. To address this challenge, physics-informed intelligent learning methods have recently emerged, significantly improving generation efficiency while maintaining high mesh quality. However, physics-informed methods fail to generalize when applied to previously unseen geometries, as even small changes in the boundary shape necessitate burdensome retraining to adapt to new geometric variations. In this paper, we introduce MeshONet, the first generalizable intelligent learning method for structured mesh generation. The method transforms the mesh generation task into an operator learning problem with multiple input and solution functions. To effectively overcome the multivariable mapping restriction of operator learning methods, we propose a dual-branch, shared-trunk architecture to approximate the mapping between function spaces based on input-output pairs. Experimental results show that MeshONet achieves a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude in generation efficiency over traditional methods. It also enables generalization to different geometries without retraining, greatly enhancing the practicality of intelligent methods.</description>

      <title>Teacher Encoder-Student Decoder Denoising Guided Segmentation Network for Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a highly challenging task, often categorized as a one-class classification and segmentation problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset, PFADSeg achieves state-of-the-art results with an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</description>

      <title>Video Depth Anything: Consistent Depth Estimation for Super-Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (&lt; 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS.</description>
