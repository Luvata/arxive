      <title>EDU-CIRCUIT-HW: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Real-World University-Level STEM Student Handwritten Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant promise for revolutionizing traditional education and reducing teachers' workload. However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions.</description>

      <title>Mirage2Matter: A Physically Grounded Gaussian World Model from Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of embodied intelligence is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of real-world interaction data. While simulation platforms provide a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from a substantial visual and physical gap to real environments and rely on expensive sensors, precise robot calibration, or depth measurements, limiting their practicality at scale. We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model. Vision Language Action (VLA) models trained on our simulated data achieve strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, matching or even surpassing results obtained with real-world data, highlighting the potential of reconstruction-driven world modeling for scalable and practical embodied intelligence training.</description>

      <title>R3G: A Reasoning--Retrieval--Reranking Framework for Vision-Centric Answer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-centric retrieval for VQA requires retrieving images to supply missing visual cues and integrating them into the reasoning process. However, selecting the right images and integrating them effectively into the model's reasoning remains challenging.To address this challenge, we propose R3G, a modular Reasoning-Retrieval-Reranking framework.It first produces a brief reasoning plan that specifies the required visual cues, then adopts a two-stage strategy, with coarse retrieval followed by fine-grained reranking, to select evidence images.On MRAG-Bench, R3G improves accuracy across six MLLM backbones and nine sub-scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art overall performance. Ablations show that sufficiency-aware reranking and reasoning steps are complementary, helping the model both choose the right images and use them well. We release code and data at https://github.com/czh24/R3G.</description>

      <title>HYPE-EDIT-1: Benchmark for Measuring Reliability in Frontier Image Editing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public demos of image editing models are typically best-case samples; real workflows pay for retries and review time. We introduce HYPE-EDIT-1, a 100-task benchmark of reference-based marketing/design edits with binary pass/fail judging. For each task we generate 10 independent outputs to estimate per-attempt pass rate, pass@10, expected attempts under a retry cap, and an effective cost per successful edit that combines model price with human review time. We release 50 public tasks and maintain a 50-task held-out private split for server-side evaluation, plus a standardized JSON schema and tooling for VLM and human-based judging. Across the evaluated models, per-attempt pass rates span 34-83 percent and effective cost per success spans USD 0.66-1.42. Models that have low per-image pricing are more expensive when you consider the total effective cost of retries and human reviews.</description>

      <title>Efficient UAV trajectory prediction: A multi-modal deep diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the requirements for managing unauthorized UAVs in the low-altitude economy, a multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction method based on the fusion of LiDAR and millimeter-wave radar information is proposed. A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.</description>

      <title>SITUATE -- Synthetic Object Counting Dataset for VLM training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SITUATE, a novel dataset designed for training and evaluating Vision Language Models on counting tasks with spatial constraints. The dataset bridges the gap between simple 2D datasets like VLMCountBench and often ambiguous real-life datasets like TallyQA, which lack control over occlusions and spatial composition. Experiments show that our dataset helps to improve generalization for out-of-distribution images, since a finetune of Qwen VL 2.5 7B on SITUATE improves accuracy on the Pixmo count test data, but not vice versa. We cross validate this by comparing the model performance across established other counting benchmarks and against an equally sized fine-tuning set derived from Pixmo count.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Presentation Attack Detection in Remote Identity Validation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presentation attack detection (PAD) subsystems are an important part of effective and user-friendly remote identity validation (RIV) systems. However, ensuring robust performance across diverse environmental and procedural conditions remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the impact of low-light conditions and automated image acquisition on the robustness of commercial PAD systems using a scenario test of RIV. Our results show that PAD systems experience a significant decline in performance when utilized in low-light or auto-capture scenarios, with a model-predicted increase in error rates by a factor of about four under low-light conditions and a doubling of those odds under auto-capture workflows. Specifically, only one of the tested systems was robust to these perturbations, maintaining a maximum bona fide presentation classification error rate below 3% across all scenarios. Our findings emphasize the importance of testing across diverse environments to ensure robust and reliable PAD performance in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Observing Health Outcomes Using Remote Sensing Imagery and Geo-Context Guided Visual Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual transformers have driven major progress in remote sensing image analysis, particularly in object detection and segmentation. Recent vision-language and multimodal models further extend these capabilities by incorporating auxiliary information, including captions, question and answer pairs, and metadata, which broadens applications beyond conventional computer vision tasks. However, these models are typically optimized for semantic alignment between visual and textual content rather than geospatial understanding, and therefore are not suited for representing or reasoning with structured geospatial layers. In this study, we propose a novel model that enhances remote sensing imagery processing with guidance from auxiliary geospatial information. Our approach introduces a geospatial embedding mechanism that transforms diverse geospatial data into embedding patches that are spatially aligned with image patches. To facilitate cross-modal interaction, we design a guided attention module that dynamically integrates multimodal information by computing attention weights based on correlations with auxiliary data, thereby directing the model toward the most relevant regions. In addition, the module assigns distinct roles to individual attention heads, allowing the model to capture complementary aspects of the guidance information and improving the interpretability of its predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing pretrained geospatial foundation models in predicting disease prevalence, highlighting its effectiveness in multimodal geospatial understanding.</description>

      <title>From Manual Observation to Automated Monitoring: Space Allowance Effects on Play Behaviour in Group-Housed Dairy Calves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Play behaviour serves as a positive welfare indicator in dairy calves, yet the influence of space allowance under commercial conditions remains poorly characterized, particularly at intermediate-to-high allowances (6-20 m2 per calf). This study investigated the relationship between space allowance and play behaviour in 60 group-housed dairy calves across 14 commercial farms in the Netherlands (space range: 2.66-17.98 m2 per calf), and developed an automated computer vision pipeline for scalable monitoring. Video observations were analyzed using a detailed ethogram, with play expressed as percentage of observation period (%OP). Statistical analysis employed linear mixed models with farm as a random effect. A computer vision pipeline was trained on manual annotations from 108 hours on 6 farms and validated on held-out test data. The computer vision classifier achieved 97.6% accuracy with 99.4% recall for active play detection. Calves spent on average 1.0% of OP playing reflecting around 10 minutes per 17-hour period. The space-play relationship was non-linear, with highest play levels at 8-10 m2 per calf (1.6% OP) and lowest at 6-8 m2 and 12-14 m2 (&lt;0.6% OP). Space remained significant after controlling for age, health, and group size. In summary, these findings suggest that 8-10 m2 per calf represents a practical target balancing welfare benefits with economic feasibility, and demonstrate that automated monitoring can scale small annotation projects to continuous welfare assessment systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Three-Dimensional Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Burn Injury Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, reproducible burn assessment is critical for treatment planning, healing monitoring, and medico-legal documentation, yet conventional visual inspection and 2D photography are subjective and limited for longitudinal comparison. This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care.</description>

      <title>1S-DAug: One-Shot Data Augmentation for Robust Few-Shot Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) challenges model generalization to novel classes based on just a few shots of labeled examples, a testbed where traditional test-time augmentations fail to be effective. We introduce 1S-DAug, a one-shot generative augmentation operator that synthesizes diverse yet faithful variants from just one example image at test time. 1S-DAug couples traditional geometric perturbations with controlled noise injection and a denoising diffusion process conditioned on the original image. The generated images are then encoded and aggregated, alongside the original image, into a combined representation for more robust FSL predictions. Integrated as a training-free model-agnostic plugin, 1S-DAug consistently improves FSL across standard benchmarks of 4 different datasets without any model parameter update, including achieving over 10% proportional accuracy improvement on the miniImagenet 5-way-1-shot benchmark. Codes will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel asynchronous, event-driven algorithm for real-time detection of small event clusters in event camera data. Like other hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms, the algorithm detects the event clusters based on their tempo-spatial distance. However, the algorithm leverages the special asynchronous data structure of event camera, and by a sophisticated, efficient and simple decision-making, enjoys a linear complexity of $O(n)$ where $n$ is the events amount. In addition, the run-time of the algorithm is independent with the dimensions of the pixels array.</description>

      <title>IC-EO: Interpretable Code-based assistant for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in computer vision, Earth Observation (EO) analysis remains difficult to perform for the laymen, requiring expert knowledge and technical capabilities. Furthermore, many systems return black-box predictions that are difficult to audit or reproduce. Leveraging recent advances in tool LLMs, this study proposes a conversational, code-generating agent that transforms natural-language queries into executable, auditable Python workflows. The agent operates over a unified easily extendable API for classification, segmentation, detection (oriented bounding boxes), spectral indices, and geospatial operators. With our proposed framework, it is possible to control the results at three levels: (i) tool-level performance on public EO benchmarks; (ii) at the agent-level to understand the capacity to generate valid, hallucination-free code; and (iii) at the task-level on specific use cases. In this work, we select two use-cases of interest: land-composition mapping and post-wildfire damage assessment. The proposed agent outperforms general-purpose LLM/VLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaVA), achieving 64.2% vs. 51.7% accuracy on land-composition and 50% vs. 0% on post-wildfire analysis, while producing results that are transparent and easy to interpret. By outputting verifiable code, the approach turns EO analysis into a transparent, reproducible process.</description>

      <title>VDE Bench: Evaluating The Capability of Image Editing Models to Modify Visual Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multimodal image editing models have achieved substantial progress, enabling users to manipulate visual content through natural language in a flexible and interactive manner. Nevertheless, an important yet insufficiently explored research direction remains visual document image editing, which involves modifying textual content within images while faithfully preserving the original text style and background context. Existing approaches, including AnyText, GlyphControl, and TextCtrl, predominantly focus on English-language scenarios and documents with relatively sparse textual layouts, thereby failing to adequately address dense, structurally complex documents or non-Latin scripts such as Chinese. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{V}isual \textbf{D}oc \textbf{E}dit Bench(VDE Bench), a rigorously human-annotated and evaluated benchmark specifically designed to assess image editing models on multilingual and complex visual document editing tasks. The benchmark comprises a high-quality dataset encompassing densely textual documents in both English and Chinese, including academic papers, posters, presentation slides, examination materials, and newspapers. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled evaluation framework that systematically quantifies editing performance at the OCR parsing level, enabling fine-grained assessment of text modification accuracy. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative state-of-the-art image editing models. Manual verification demonstrates a strong consistency between human judgments and automated evaluation metrics. VDE Bench constitutes the first systematic benchmark for evaluating image editing models on multilingual and densely textual visual documents.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Maritime Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of anomalies is crucial to ensuring the safety and security of maritime vessel traffic surveillance. Although autoencoders are popular for anomaly detection, their effectiveness in identifying collective and contextual anomalies is limited, especially in the maritime domain, where anomalies depend on vessel-specific contexts derived from self-reported AIS messages. To address these limitations, we propose a novel solution: the context-aware autoencoder. By integrating context-specific thresholds, our method improves detection accuracy and reduces computational cost. We compare four context-aware autoencoder variants and a conventional autoencoder using a case study focused on fishing status anomalies in maritime surveillance. Results demonstrate the significant impact of context on reconstruction loss and anomaly detection. The context-aware autoencoder outperforms others in detecting anomalies in time series data. By incorporating context-specific thresholds and recognizing the importance of context in anomaly detection, our approach offers a promising solution to improve accuracy in maritime vessel traffic surveillance systems.</description>

      <title>D3R-Net: Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction Network for Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) is a key ingredient of automated visual inspection in modern manufacturing. The reconstruction-based methods appeal because they have basic architectural design and they process data quickly but they produce oversmoothed results for high-frequency details. As a result, subtle defects are partially reconstructed rather than highlighted, which limits segmentation accuracy. We build on this line of work and introduce D3R-Net, a Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction framework that couples a self-supervised 'healing' task with frequency-aware regularization. During training, the network receives synthetically corrupted normal images and is asked to reconstruct the clean targets, which prevents trivial identity mapping and pushes the model to learn the manifold of defect-free textures. In addition to the spatial mean squared error, we employ a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude loss that encourages consistency in the frequency domain. The implementation also allows an optional structural similarity (SSIM) term, which we study in an ablation. On the MVTec AD Hazelnut benchmark, D3R-Net with the FFT loss improves localization consistency over a spatial-only baseline: PRO AUC increases from 0.603 to 0.687, while image-level ROC AUC remains robust. Evaluated across fifteen MVTec categories, the FFT variant raises the average pixel ROC AUC from 0.733 to 0.751 and PRO AUC from 0.417 to 0.468 compared to the MSE-only baseline, at roughly 20 FPS on a single GPU. The network is trained from scratch and uses a lightweight convolutional autoencoder backbone, providing a practical alternative to heavy pre-trained feature embedding methods.</description>

      <title>PovNet+: A Deep Learning Architecture for Socially Assistive Robots to Learn and Assist with Multiple Activities of Daily Living</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant barrier to the long-term deployment of autonomous socially assistive robots is their inability to both perceive and assist with multiple activities of daily living (ADLs). In this paper, we present the first multimodal deep learning architecture, POVNet+, for multi-activity recognition for socially assistive robots to proactively initiate assistive behaviors. Our novel architecture introduces the use of both ADL and motion embedding spaces to uniquely distinguish between a known ADL being performed, a new unseen ADL, or a known ADL being performed atypically in order to assist people in real scenarios. Furthermore, we apply a novel user state estimation method to the motion embedding space to recognize new ADLs while monitoring user performance. This ADL perception information is used to proactively initiate robot assistive interactions. Comparison experiments with state-of-the-art human activity recognition methods show our POVNet+ method has higher ADL classification accuracy. Human-robot interaction experiments in a cluttered living environment with multiple users and the socially assistive robot Leia using POVNet+ demonstrate the ability of our multi-modal ADL architecture in successfully identifying different seen and unseen ADLs, and ADLs being performed atypically, while initiating appropriate assistive human-robot interactions.</description>

      <title>Shedding the Facades, Connecting the Domains: Detecting Shifting Multimodal Hate Video with Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate Video Detection (HVD) is crucial for online ecosystems. Existing methods assume identical distributions between training (source) and inference (target) data. However, hateful content often evolves into irregular and ambiguous forms to evade censorship, resulting in substantial semantic drift and rendering previously trained models ineffective. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a solution by adapting models during inference to narrow the cross-domain gap, while conventional TTA methods target mild distribution shifts and struggle with the severe semantic drift in HVD. To tackle these challenges, we propose SCANNER, the first TTA framework tailored for HVD. Motivated by the insight that, despite the evolving nature of hateful manifestations, their underlying cores remain largely invariant (i.e., targeting is still based on characteristics like gender, race, etc), we leverage these stable cores as a bridge to connect the source and target domains. Specifically, SCANNER initially reveals the stable cores from the ambiguous layout in evolving hateful content via a principled centroid-guided alignment mechanism. To alleviate the impact of outlier-like samples that are weakly correlated with centroids during the alignment process, SCANNER enhances the prior by incorporating a sample-level adaptive centroid alignment strategy, promoting more stable adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate semantic collapse from overly uniform outputs within clusters, SCANNER introduces an intra-cluster diversity regularization that encourages the cluster-wise semantic richness. Experiments show that SCANNER outperforms all baselines, with an average gain of 4.69% in Macro-F1 over the best.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-FA: Learning Fourier Approximation for Compressing Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive performance on various vision-language tasks, but their substantial computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing compression methods often decouple low-rank decomposition and quantization, leading to compounded reconstruction errors, especially in multimodal architectures with cross-modal redundancy. To address this issue, we propose LLaVA-FA, a novel efficient LMM that performs joint low-rank plus quantization approximation in the frequency domain. By leveraging the de-correlation and conjugate symmetry properties of Fourier transform, LLaVA-FA achieves more compact and accurate weight representations. Furthermore, we introduce PolarQuant, a polar-coordinate quantization method tailored for complex matrices, and an optional diagonal calibration (ODC) scheme that eliminates the need for large-scale calibration data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LLaVA-FA outperforms existing efficient multimodal models across multiple benchmarks while maintaining minimal activated parameters and low computational costs, validating its effectiveness as a powerful solution for compressing LMMs.</description>

      <title>Scalable Analytic Classifiers with Associative Drift Compensation for Class-Incremental Learning of Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) with Vision Transformers (ViTs) faces a major computational bottleneck during the classifier reconstruction phase, where most existing methods rely on costly iterative stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We observe that analytic Regularized Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (RGDA) provides a Bayes-optimal alternative with accuracy comparable to SGD-based classifiers; however, its quadratic inference complexity limits its use in large-scale CIL scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Low-Rank Factorized RGDA (LR-RGDA), a scalable classifier that combines RGDA's expressivity with the efficiency of linear classifiers. By exploiting the low-rank structure of the covariance via the Woodbury matrix identity, LR-RGDA decomposes the discriminant function into a global affine term refined by a low-rank quadratic perturbation, reducing the inference complexity from $\mathcal{O}(Cd^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(d^2 + Crd^2)$, where $C$ is the class number, $d$ the feature dimension, and $r \ll d$ the subspace rank. To mitigate representation drift caused by backbone updates, we further introduce Hopfield-based Distribution Compensator (HopDC), a training-free mechanism that uses modern continuous Hopfield Networks to recalibrate historical class statistics through associative memory dynamics on unlabeled anchors, accompanied by a theoretical bound on the estimation error. Extensive experiments on diverse CIL benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a scalable solution for large-scale class-incremental learning with ViTs.

      <title>DensiThAI, A Multi-View Deep Learning Framework for Breast Density Estimation using Infrared Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast tissue density is a key biomarker of breast cancer risk and a major factor affecting mammographic sensitivity. However, density assessment currently relies almost exclusively on X-ray mammography, an ionizing imaging modality. This study investigates the feasibility of estimating breast density using artificial intelligence over infrared thermal images, offering a non-ionizing imaging approach. The underlying hypothesis is that fibroglandular and adipose tissues exhibit distinct thermophysical and physiological properties, leading to subtle but spatially coherent temperature variations on the breast surface. In this paper, we propose DensiThAI, a multi-view deep learning framework for breast density classification from thermal images. The framework was evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 3,500 women using mammography-derived density labels as reference. Using five standard thermal views, DensiThAI achieved a mean AUROC of 0.73 across 10 random splits, with statistically significant separation between density classes across all splits (p &lt;&lt; 0.05). Consistent performance across age cohorts supports the potential of thermal imaging as a non-ionizing approach for breast density assessment with implications for improved patient experience and workflow optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics-Grounded 4D Dynamics with Neural Gaussian Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting physical dynamics from raw visual data remains a major challenge in AI. While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.</description>

      <title>SDCM: Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for Radar-Vision 3-D Object Detection in Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3-D object detection based on 4-D radar-vision is an important part in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, there are two challenges which need to be faced. First, the 4-D radar point clouds are sparse, leading to poor 3-D representation. Second, vision datas exhibit representation degradation under low-light, long distance detection and dense occlusion scenes, which provides unreliable texture information during fusion stage. To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation. Thirdly, considering that feature tensor difference values contain the effective information of every modality, which could be extracted and modeled for heterogeneity reduction and modalities interaction, Mamba Modeling Interactive Fusion (MMIF) module is designed for reducing heterogeneous and achieving interactive Fusion. Experiment results on the VoD, TJ4DRadSet and Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset show that SDCM achieves best performance with lower parameter quantity and faster inference speed. Our code will be available.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Histopathological Foundation Models on Regressive Prediction of Homologous Recombination Deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale histopathology data have found great success in various fields of computational pathology, but their impact on regressive biomarker prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different sampling strategies and instance bagsizes by ablation studies. Our results highlight the benefits of large-scale histopathological pretraining for more precise and transferable regressive biomarker prediction, showcasing its potential to advance AI-driven precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Human Activity Recognition on Edge Microcontrollers: Dynamic Hierarchical Inference with Multi-Spectral Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for accurate on-device pattern recognition in edge applications is intensifying, yet existing approaches struggle to reconcile accuracy with computational constraints. To address this challenge, a resource-aware hierarchical network based on multi-spectral fusion and interpretable modules, namely the Hierarchical Parallel Pseudo-image Enhancement Fusion Network (HPPI-Net), is proposed for real-time, on-device Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Deployed on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller for low-power real-time inference, HPPI-Net achieves 96.70% accuracy while utilizing only 22.3 KiB of RAM and 439.5 KiB of ROM after optimization. HPPI-Net employs a two-layer architecture. The first layer extracts preliminary features using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrograms, while the second layer selectively activates either a dedicated module for stationary activity recognition or a parallel LSTM-MobileNet network (PLMN) for dynamic states. PLMN fuses FFT, Wavelet, and Gabor spectrograms through three parallel LSTM encoders and refines the concatenated features using Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC), thereby offering channel-level interpretability while substantially reducing multiply-accumulate operations. Compared with MobileNetV3, HPPI-Net improves accuracy by 1.22% and reduces RAM usage by 71.2% and ROM usage by 42.1%. These results demonstrate that HPPI-Net achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off and provides explainable predictions, establishing a practical solution for wearable, industrial, and smart home HAR on memory-constrained edge platforms.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Pose Estimation for Multi-Label Recognition of Combined Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) such as dystonia, tremor, chorea, myoclonus, and tics are disabling motor manifestations across childhood and adulthood. Their fluctuating, intermittent, and frequently co-occurring expressions hinder clinical recognition and longitudinal monitoring, which remain largely subjective and vulnerable to inter-rater variability. Objective and scalable methods to distinguish overlapping HMD phenotypes from routine clinical videos are still lacking. Here, we developed a pose-based machine-learning framework that converts standard outpatient videos into anatomically meaningful keypoint time series and computes kinematic descriptors spanning statistical, temporal, spectral, and higher-order irregularity-complexity features.</description>

      <title>YOLOE-26: Integrating YOLO26 with YOLOE for Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents YOLOE-26, a unified framework that integrates the deployment-optimized YOLO26(or YOLOv26) architecture with the open-vocabulary learning paradigm of YOLOE for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation. Building on the NMS-free, end-to-end design of YOLOv26, the proposed approach preserves the hallmark efficiency and determinism of the YOLO family while extending its capabilities beyond closed-set recognition. YOLOE-26 employs a convolutional backbone with PAN/FPN-style multi-scale feature aggregation, followed by end-to-end regression and instance segmentation heads. A key architectural contribution is the replacement of fixed class logits with an object embedding head, which formulates classification as similarity matching against prompt embeddings derived from text descriptions, visual examples, or a built-in vocabulary. To enable efficient open-vocabulary reasoning, the framework incorporates Re-Parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) for zero-overhead text prompting, a Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE) for example-guided segmentation, and Lazy Region Prompt Contrast for prompt-free inference. All prompting modalities operate within a unified object embedding space, allowing seamless switching between text-prompted, visual-prompted, and fully autonomous segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent scaling behavior and favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across model sizes in both prompted and prompt-free settings. The training strategy leverages large-scale detection and grounding datasets with multi-task optimization and remains fully compatible with the Ultralytics ecosystem for training, validation, and deployment. Overall, YOLOE-26 provides a practical and scalable solution for real-time open-vocabulary instance segmentation in dynamic, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Intra-Class Subdivision for Pixel Contrastive Learning: Application to Semi-supervised Cardiac Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an intra-class subdivision pixel contrastive learning (SPCL) framework for cardiac image segmentation to address representation contamination at boundaries. The novel concept ``Unconcerned sample'' is proposed to distinguish pixel representations at the inner and boundary regions within the same class, facilitating a clearer characterization of intra-class variations. A novel boundary contrastive loss for boundary representations is proposed to enhance representation discrimination across boundaries. The advantages of the unconcerned sample and boundary contrastive loss are analyzed theoretically. Experimental results in public cardiac datasets demonstrate that SPCL significantly improves segmentation performance, outperforming existing methods with respect to segmentation quality and boundary precision. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jrstud203/SPCL.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Diffusion Posterior Sampling by Noise--Frequency Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion posterior sampling solves inverse problems by combining a pretrained diffusion prior with measurement-consistency guidance, but it often fails to recover fine details because measurement terms are applied in a manner that is weakly coupled to the diffusion noise level. At high noise, data-consistency gradients computed from inaccurate estimates can be geometrically incongruent with the posterior geometry, inducing early-step drift, spurious high-frequency artifacts, plus sensitivity to schedules and ill-conditioned operators. To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable. Across super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves motion deblurring PSNR by up to 5 dB over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>CamReasoner: Reinforcing Camera Movement Understanding via Structured Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding camera dynamics is a fundamental pillar of video spatial intelligence. However, existing multimodal models predominantly treat this task as a black-box classification, often confusing physically distinct motions by relying on superficial visual patterns rather than geometric cues. We present CamReasoner, a framework that reformulates camera movement understanding as a structured inference process to bridge the gap between perception and cinematic logic. Our approach centers on the Observation-Thinking-Answer (O-T-A) paradigm, which compels the model to decode spatio-temporal cues such as trajectories and view frustums within an explicit reasoning block. To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork. By applying Reinforcement Learning to the Observation-Think-Answer (O-T-A) reasoning paradigm, CamReasoner effectively suppresses hallucinations and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Image Detectors Overrely on Global Artifacts: Evidence from Inpainting Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep learning-based inpainting enables realistic local image manipulation, raising critical challenges for reliable detection. However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\% to 55\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection. Indeed, training on our dataset yields better generalization and localization than standard inpainting. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/INP-X.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Model Purified Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) can learn rich visual knowledge from low-cost unlabeled images. However, traditional S4 architectures all face the challenge of low-quality pseudo-labels, especially for the teacher-student framework.We propose a novel SemiEarth model that introduces vision-language models (VLMs) to address the S4 issues for the remote sensing (RS) domain. Specifically, we invent a VLM pseudo-label purifying (VLM-PP) structure to purify the teacher network's pseudo-labels, achieving substantial improvements. Especially in multi-class boundary regions of RS images, the VLM-PP module can significantly improve the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the teacher, thereby correctly guiding the student model's learning. Moreover, since VLM-PP equips VLMs with open-world capabilities and is independent of the S4 architecture, it can correct mispredicted categories in low-confidence pseudo-labels whenever a discrepancy arises between its prediction and the pseudo-label. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple RS datasets, which demonstrate that our SemiEarth achieves SOTA performance. More importantly, unlike previous SOTA RS S4 methods, our model not only achieves excellent performance but also offers good interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/wangshanwen001/SemiEarth.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration via Confidence-bound Multi-Hop Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised deformable image registration requires aligning complex anatomical structures without reference labels, making interpretability and reliability critical. Existing deep learning methods achieve considerable accuracy but often lack transparency, leading to error drift and reduced clinical trust. We propose a novel Multi-Hop Visual Chain of Reasoning (VCoR) framework that reformulates registration as a progressive reasoning process. Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures. By embedding an implicit visual reasoning paradigm, we present an interpretable, reliable, and clinically viable unsupervised medical image registration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumonia has been one of the major causes of morbidities and mortality in the world and the prevalence of this disease is disproportionately high among the pediatric and elderly populations especially in resources trained areas Fast and precise diagnosis is a prerequisite for successful clinical intervention but due to inter observer variation fatigue among experts and a shortage of qualified radiologists traditional approaches that rely on manual interpretation of chest radiographs are frequently constrained To address these problems this paper introduces a unified automated diagnostic model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network CNN that can recognize pneumonia in chest Xray images with high precision and at minimal computational expense In contrast like other generic transfer learning based models which often possess redundant parameters the offered architecture uses a tailor made depth wise separable convolutional design which is optimized towards textural characteristics of grayscale medical images Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization CLAHE and geometric augmentation are two significant preprocessing techniques used to ensure that the system does not experience class imbalance and is more likely to generalize The system is tested using a dataset of 5863 anterior posterior chest Xrays.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Multimodal Foundation Model Integrating Bp-MRI and Clinical Reports in Prostate Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. Bi-parametric MRI (bp-MRI) and clinical variables are crucial for PCa identification and improving treatment decisions. However, this process is subjective to expert interpretations. Furthermore, most existing computer-aided diagnosis methods focus on imaging-based models, overlooking the clinical context and suffering from data scarcity, limiting their ability to learn robust representations. We propose a geometric multimodal Foundation Model (FM), named MFM-Geom, that learns representations from bp-MRI and clinical reports, encoding visual findings and information from the context of clinical variables. In the representations classification head, the approach leverages symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and Riemannian deep learning to integrate imaging-text representations from a biomedical multimodal FM. Using 10% of the training data, MFM-Geom outperformed baseline class token embedding-based classification (+8.3%, AUC-PR of 90.67). Generalization on external dataset confirmed the robustness of fine-tuning biomedical FM, achieving an AUC-PR of 90.6.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cacao Disease Identification and Management App Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smallholder cacao producers often rely on outdated farming techniques and face significant challenges from pests and diseases, unlike larger plantations with more resources and expertise. In the Philippines, cacao farmers have limited access to data, information, and good agricultural practices. This study addresses these issues by developing a mobile application for cacao disease identification and management that functions offline, enabling use in remote areas where farms are mostly located. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained to identify cacao diseases accurately. The trained model is integrated into the mobile app to support farmers in field diagnosis. The disease identification model achieved a validation accuracy of 96.93% while the model for detecting cacao black pod infection levels achieved 79.49% validation accuracy. Field testing of the application showed an agreement rate of 84.2% compared with expert cacao technician assessments. This approach empowers smallholder farmers by providing accessible, technology-enabled tools to improve cacao crop health and productivity.</description>

      <title>CAPA: Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient inference in Large Vision-Language Models is constrained by the high cost of processing thousands of visual tokens, yet it remains unclear which tokens and computations can be safely removed. While attention scores are commonly used to estimate visual token importance, they are an imperfect proxy for actual contribution. We show that Attention Contribution, which weights attention probabilities by value vector magnitude, provides a more accurate criterion for visual token selection. Our empirical analysis reveals that visual attention sinks are functionally heterogeneous, comprising Probability Dumps with low contribution that can be safely pruned, and Structural Anchors with high contribution essential for maintaining model performance. Further, we identify substantial redundancy in Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) associated with visual tokens, particularly in intermediate layers where image tokens exhibit linear behavior. Based on our findings, we introduce CAPA (Contribution-Aware Pruning and FFN Approximation), a dual-strategy framework that prunes visual tokens using attention contribution at critical functional transitions and reduces FFN computation through efficient linear approximations. Experiments on various benchmarks across baselines show that CAPA achieves competent efficiency--performance trade-offs with improved robustness.</description>

      <title>SANEval: Open-Vocabulary Compositional Benchmarks with Failure-mode Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented creative potential, yet their ability to faithfully render complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships remains a significant bottleneck. Progress is hampered by a lack of adequate evaluation methods; current benchmarks are often restricted to closed-set vocabularies, lack fine-grained diagnostic capabilities, and fail to provide the interpretable feedback necessary to diagnose and remedy specific compositional failures. We solve these challenges by introducing SANEval (Spatial, Attribute, and Numeracy Evaluation), a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a scalable new pipeline for open-vocabulary compositional evaluation. SANEval combines a large language model (LLM) for deep prompt understanding with an LLM-enhanced, open-vocabulary object detector to robustly evaluate compositional adherence, unconstrained by a fixed vocabulary. Through extensive experiments on six state-of-the-art T2I models, we demonstrate that SANEval's automated evaluations provide a more faithful proxy for human assessment; our metric achieves a Spearman's rank correlation with statistically different results than those of existing benchmarks across tasks of attribute binding, spatial relations, and numeracy. To facilitate future research in compositional T2I generation and evaluation, we will release the SANEval dataset and our open-source evaluation pipeline.</description>

      <title>Subspace Clustering on Incomplete Data with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace clustering aims to group data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces and finds wide application in computer vision, hyperspectral imaging, and recommendation systems. However, most existing methods assume fully observed data, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with missing entries. In this paper, we propose a contrastive self-supervised framework, Contrastive Subspace Clustering (CSC), designed for clustering incomplete data. CSC generates masked views of partially observed inputs and trains a deep neural network using a SimCLR-style contrastive loss to learn invariant embeddings. These embeddings are then clustered using sparse subspace clustering. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that CSC consistently outperforms both classical and deep learning baselines, demonstrating strong robustness to missing data and scalability to large datasets.</description>

      <title>World-Shaper: A Unified Framework for 360{\deg} Panoramic Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to edit panoramic images is crucial for creating realistic 360{\deg} visual experiences. However, existing perspective-based image editing methods fail to model the spatial structure of panoramas. Conventional cube-map decompositions attempt to overcome this problem but inevitably break global consistency due to their mismatch with spherical geometry. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate panoramic editing directly in the equirectangular projection (ERP) domain and present World-Shaper, a unified geometry-aware framework that bridges panoramic generation and editing within a single editing-centric design. To overcome the scarcity of paired data, we adopt a generate-then-edit paradigm, where controllable panoramic generation serves as an auxiliary stage to synthesize diverse paired examples for supervised editing learning. To address geometric distortion, we introduce a geometry-aware learning strategy that explicitly enforces position-aware shape supervision and implicitly internalizes panoramic priors through progressive training. Extensive experiments on our new benchmark, PEBench, demonstrate that our method achieves superior geometric consistency, editing fidelity, and text controllability compared to SOTA methods, enabling coherent and flexible 360{\deg} visual world creation with unified editing control. Code, model, and data will be released at our project page: https://world-shaper-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>PLACID: Identity-Preserving Multi-Object Compositing via Video Diffusion with Synthetic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved photorealistic image synthesis, yet they fall short for studio-level multi-object compositing. This task demands simultaneous (i) near-perfect preservation of each item's identity, (ii) precise background and color fidelity, (iii) layout and design elements control, and (iv) complete, appealing displays showcasing all objects. However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.</description>

Abstract: Auto-regressive video generation enables long video synthesis by iteratively conditioning each new batch of frames on previously generated content. However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.</description>

      <title>TimeBlind: A Spatio-Temporal Compositionality Benchmark for Video LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

      <title>Computer Vision and Its Relationship to Cognitive Science: A perspective from Bayes Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents an introduction to computer vision, and its relationship to Cognitive Science, from the perspective of Bayes Decision Theory (Berger 1985). Computer vision is a vast and complex field, so this overview has a narrow scope and provides a theoretical lens which captures many key concepts. BDT is rich enough to include two different approaches: (i) the Bayesian viewpoint, which gives a conceptually attractive framework for vision with concepts that resonate with Cognitive Science (Griffiths et al., 2024), and (ii) the Deep Neural Network approach whose successes in the real world have made Computer Vision into a trillion-dollar industry and which is motivated by the hierarchical structure of the visual ventral stream. The BDT framework relates and captures the strengths and weakness of these two approaches and, by discussing the limitations of BDT, points the way to how they can be combined in a richer framework.</description>

      <title>LogicGaze: Benchmarking Causal Consistency in Visual Narratives via Counterfactual Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While sequential reasoning enhances the capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to execute complex multimodal tasks, their reliability in grounding these reasoning chains within actual visual evidence remains insufficiently explored. We introduce LogicGaze, a novel benchmark framework designed to rigorously interrogate whether VLMs can validate sequential causal chains against visual inputs, specifically targeting the pervasive issue of hallucination. Curated from 40,000 video segments from ShareGPT4Video and a subset of Flickr30k imagery, LogicGaze integrates causal sequences with visually contradictory yet linguistically plausible perturbations, compelling models to verify the authenticity of each reasoning step. Our tripartite evaluation protocol - Causal Validation, Grounded Narrative Synthesis, and Perturbation Rejection - exposes significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. LogicGaze advocates for robust, trustworthy multimodal reasoning, with all resources publicly available in an anonymized repository.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation: Leveraging Routine Radiological Annotations to Guide 3D CT Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of machine learning models for CT imaging depends on the availability of large, high-quality, and diverse annotated datasets. Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings. These results suggest that large-scale mining of historical GSPS annotations represents a promising and scalable approach for generating 3D CT segmentation datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Assessment of Sensitivity of Autonomous Vehicle Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viability of automated driving is heavily dependent on the performance of perception systems to provide real-time accurate and reliable information for robust decision-making and maneuvers. These systems must perform reliably not only under ideal conditions, but also when challenged by natural and adversarial driving factors. Both of these types of interference can lead to perception errors and delays in detection and classification. Hence, it is essential to assess the robustness of the perception systems of automated vehicles (AVs) and explore strategies for making perception more reliable. We approach this problem by evaluating perception performance using predictive sensitivity quantification based on an ensemble of models, capturing model disagreement and inference variability across multiple models, under adverse driving scenarios in both simulated environments and real-world conditions. A notional architecture for assessing perception performance is proposed. A perception assessment criterion is developed based on an AV's stopping distance at a stop sign on varying road surfaces, such as dry and wet asphalt, and vehicle speed. Five state-of-the-art computer vision models are used, including YOLO (v8-v9), DEtection TRansformer (DETR50, DETR101), Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR)in our experiments. Diminished lighting conditions, e.g., resulting from the presence of fog and low sun altitude, have the greatest impact on the performance of the perception models. Additionally, adversarial road conditions such as occlusions of roadway objects increase perception sensitivity and model performance drops when faced with a combination of adversarial road conditions and inclement weather conditions. Also, it is demonstrated that the greater the distance to a roadway object, the greater the impact on perception performance, hence diminished perception robustness.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Semantic Chasm: Synergistic Conceptual Anchoring for Generalized Few-Shot and Zero-Shot OOD Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a pioneering Synergistic Neural Agents Network (SynerNet) framework designed to mitigate the phenomenon of cross-modal alignment degeneration in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) concepts. Specifically, four specialized computational units - visual perception, linguistic context, nominal embedding, and global coordination - collaboratively rectify modality disparities via a structured message-propagation protocol. The principal contributions encompass a multi-agent latent space nomenclature acquisition framework, a semantic context-interchange algorithm for enhanced few-shot adaptation, and an adaptive dynamic equilibrium mechanism. Empirical evaluations conducted on the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that SynerNet yields substantial performance augmentations in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, exhibiting precision improvements ranging from 1.2% to 5.4% across a diverse array of domains.</description>

      <title>When RAG Hurts: Diagnosing and Mitigating Attention Distraction in Retrieval-Augmented LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the dominant paradigms for enhancing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on knowledge-based VQA tasks, recent work attributes RAG failures to insufficient attention towards the retrieved context, proposing to reduce the attention allocated to image tokens. In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline. Notably, MAD-RAG rectifies up to 74.68% of failure cases with negligible computational overhead.</description>

      <title>AdaFuse: Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Lung Cancer Risk Prediction via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal fusion has emerged as a promising paradigm for disease diagnosis and prognosis, integrating complementary information from heterogeneous data sources such as medical images, clinical records, and radiology reports. However, existing fusion methods process all available modalities through the network, either treating them equally or learning to assign different contribution weights, leaving a fundamental question unaddressed: for a given patient, should certain modalities be used at all? We present AdaFuse, an adaptive multimodal fusion framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn patient-specific modality selection and fusion strategies for lung cancer risk prediction. AdaFuse formulates multimodal fusion as a sequential decision process, where the policy network iteratively decides whether to incorporate an additional modality or proceed to prediction based on the information already acquired. This sequential formulation enables the model to condition each selection on previously observed modalities and terminate early when sufficient information is available, rather than committing to a fixed subset upfront. We evaluate AdaFuse on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaFuse achieves the highest AUC (0.762) compared to the best single-modality baseline (0.732), the best fixed fusion strategy (0.759), and adaptive baselines including DynMM (0.754) and MoE (0.742), while using fewer FLOPs than all triple-modality methods. Our work demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning for personalized multimodal fusion in medical imaging, representing a shift from uniform fusion strategies toward adaptive diagnostic pipelines that learn when to consult additional modalities and when existing information suffices for accurate prediction.</description>

      <title>MASC: Metal-Aware Sampling and Correction via Reinforcement Learning for Accelerated MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal implants in MRI cause severe artifacts that degrade image quality and hinder clinical diagnosis. Traditional approaches address metal artifact reduction (MAR) and accelerated MRI acquisition as separate problems. We propose MASC, a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes metal-aware k-space sampling and artifact correction for accelerated MRI. To enable supervised training, we construct a paired MRI dataset using physics-based simulation, generating k-space data and reconstructions for phantoms with and without metal implants. This paired dataset provides simulated 3D MRI scans with and without metal implants, where each metal-corrupted sample has an exactly matched clean reference, enabling direct supervision for both artifact reduction and acquisition policy learning. We formulate active MRI acquisition as a sequential decision-making problem, where an artifact-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent learns to select k-space phase-encoding lines under a limited acquisition budget. The agent operates on undersampled reconstructions processed through a U-Net-based MAR network, learning patterns that maximize reconstruction quality. We further propose an end-to-end training scheme where the acquisition policy learns to select k-space lines that best support artifact removal while the MAR network simultaneously adapts to the resulting undersampling patterns. Experiments demonstrate that MASC's learned policies outperform conventional sampling strategies, and end-to-end training improves performance compared to using a frozen pre-trained MAR network, validating the benefit of joint optimization. Cross-dataset experiments on FastMRI with physics-based artifact simulation further confirm generalization to realistic clinical MRI data. The code and models of MASC have been made publicly available: https://github.com/hrlblab/masc</description>

      <title>ReLAPSe: Reinforcement-Learning-trained Adversarial Prompt Search for Erased concepts in unlearned diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is a key defense mechanism for removing unauthorized concepts from text-to-image diffusion models, yet recent evidence shows that latent visual information often persists after unlearning. Existing adversarial approaches for exploiting this leakage are constrained by fundamental limitations: optimization-based methods are computationally expensive due to per-instance iterative search. At the same time, reasoning-based and heuristic techniques lack direct feedback from the target model's latent visual representations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReLAPSe, a policy-based adversarial framework that reformulates concept restoration as a reinforcement learning problem. ReLAPSe trains an agent using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), leveraging the diffusion model's noise prediction loss as a model-intrinsic and verifiable feedback signal. This closed-loop design directly aligns textual prompt manipulation with latent visual residuals, enabling the agent to learn transferable restoration strategies rather than optimizing isolated prompts. By pioneering the shift from per-instance optimization to global policy learning, ReLAPSe achieves efficient, near-real-time recovery of fine-grained identities and styles across multiple state-of-the-art unlearning methods, providing a scalable tool for rigorous red-teaming of unlearned diffusion models. Some experimental evaluations involve sensitive visual concepts, such as nudity. Code is available at https://github.com/gmum/ReLaPSe</description>

      <title>Modeling Image-Caption Rating from Comparative Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rating the accuracy of captions in describing images is time-consuming and subjective for humans. In contrast, it is often easier for people to compare two captions and decide which one better matches a given image. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework that models such comparative judgments instead of direct ratings. The model can then be applied to rank unseen image-caption pairs in the same way as a regression model trained on direct ratings. Using the VICR dataset, we extract visual features with ResNet-50 and text features with MiniLM, then train both a regression model and a comparative learning model. While the regression model achieves better performance (Pearson's $\rho$: 0.7609 and Spearman's $r_s$: 0.7089), the comparative learning model steadily improves with more data and approaches the regression baseline. In addition, a small-scale human evaluation study comparing absolute rating, pairwise comparison, and same-image comparison shows that comparative annotation yields faster results and has greater agreement among human annotators. These results suggest that comparative learning can effectively model human preferences while significantly reducing the cost of human annotations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles: A Comparative Study of One-Stage and Two-Stage Detectors on Basic Traffic Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection is a crucial component in autonomous vehicle systems. It enables the vehicle to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating various objects around it. By utilizing advanced imaging and deep learning techniques, autonomous vehicle systems can rapidly and accurately identify objects based on their features. Different deep learning methods vary in their ability to accurately detect and classify objects in autonomous vehicle systems. Selecting the appropriate method significantly impacts system performance, robustness, and efficiency in real-world driving scenarios. While several generic deep learning architectures like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN have been proposed, guidance on their suitability for specific autonomous driving applications is often limited. The choice of method affects detection accuracy, processing speed, environmental robustness, sensor integration, scalability, and edge case handling. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing two prominent object detection models: YOLOv5 (a one-stage detector) and Faster R-CNN (a two-stage detector). Their performance is evaluated on a diverse dataset combining real and synthetic images, considering various metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, and inference speed. The findings reveal that YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance in terms of mAP, recall, and training efficiency, particularly as dataset size and image resolution increase. However, Faster R-CNN shows advantages in detecting small, distant objects and performs well in challenging lighting conditions. The models' behavior is also analyzed under different confidence thresholds and in various real-world scenarios, providing insights into their applicability for autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Robust automatic brain vessel segmentation in 3D CTA scans using dynamic 4D-CTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (aDHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

      <title>Brazilian Portuguese Image Captioning with Transformers: A Study on Cross-Native-Translated Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image captioning (IC) refers to the automatic generation of natural language descriptions for images, with applications ranging from social media content generation to assisting individuals with visual impairments. While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment. Attention analysis reveals systematic biases, including gender misclassification, object enumeration errors, and spatial inconsistencies. The datasets and the models generated and analyzed during the current study are available in: https://github.com/laicsiifes/transformer-caption-ptbr.</description>

      <title>Modeling Art Evaluations from Comparative Judgments: A Deep Learning Approach to Predicting Aesthetic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human aesthetic judgments in visual art presents significant challenges due to individual preference variability and the high cost of obtaining labeled data. To reduce cost of acquiring such labels, we propose to apply a comparative learning framework based on pairwise preference assessments rather than direct ratings. This approach leverages the Law of Comparative Judgment, which posits that relative choices exhibit less cognitive burden and greater cognitive consistency than direct scoring. We extract deep convolutional features from painting images using ResNet-50 and develop both a deep neural network regression model and a dual-branch pairwise comparison model. We explored four research questions: (RQ1) How does the proposed deep neural network regression model with CNN features compare to the baseline linear regression model using hand-crafted features? (RQ2) How does pairwise comparative learning compare to regression-based prediction when lacking access to direct rating values? (RQ3) Can we predict individual rater preferences through within-rater and cross-rater analysis? (RQ4) What is the annotation cost trade-off between direct ratings and comparative judgments in terms of human time and effort? Our results show that the deep regression model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving up to $328\%$ improvement in $R^2$. The comparative model approaches regression performance despite having no access to direct rating values, validating the practical utility of pairwise comparisons. However, predicting individual preferences remains challenging, with both within-rater and cross-rater performance significantly lower than average rating prediction. Human subject experiments reveal that comparative judgments require $60\%$ less annotation time per item, demonstrating superior annotation efficiency for large-scale preference modeling.</description>

      <title>3DGS$^2$-TR: Scalable Second-Order Trust-Region Method for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose 3DGS$^2$-TR,a second-order optimizer for accelerating the scene training problem in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing second-order approaches that rely on explicit or dense curvature representations, such as 3DGS-LM (H\"ollein et al., 2025) or 3DGS2 (Lan et al., 2025), our method approximates curvature using only the diagonal of the Hessian matrix, efficiently via Hutchinson's method. Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Laboratory Safety Monitoring with Vision Language Models: Learning to See Hazards Through Scene Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratories are prone to severe injuries from minor unsafe actions, yet continuous safety monitoring -- beyond mandatory pre-lab safety training -- is limited by human availability. Vision language models (VLMs) offer promise for autonomous laboratory safety monitoring, but their effectiveness in realistic settings is unclear due to the lack of visual evaluation data, as most safety incidents are documented primarily as unstructured text. To address this gap, we first introduce a structured data generation pipeline that converts textual laboratory scenarios into aligned triples of (image, scene graph, ground truth), using large language models as scene graph architects and image generation models as renderers. Our experiments on the synthetic dataset of 1,207 samples across 362 unique scenarios and seven open- and closed-source models show that VLMs perform effectively given textual scene graph, but degrade substantially in visual-only settings indicating difficulty in extracting structured object relationships directly from pixels. To overcome this, we propose a post-training context-engineering approach, scene-graph-guided alignment, to bridge perceptual gaps in VLMs by translating visual inputs into structured scene graphs better aligned with VLM reasoning, improving hazard detection performance in visual only settings.</description>

      <title>Text is All You Need for Vision-Language Model Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly equipped with robust safety safeguards to prevent responses to harmful or disallowed prompts. However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs.</description>

      <title>DISK: Dynamic Inference SKipping for World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DISK, a training-free adaptive inference method for autoregressive world models. DISK coordinates two coupled diffusion transformers for video and ego-trajectory via dual-branch controllers with cross-modal skip decisions, preserving motion-appearance consistency without retraining. We extend higher-order latent-difference skip testing to the autoregressive chain-of-forward regime and propagate controller statistics through rollout loops for long-horizon stability. When integrated into closed-loop driving rollouts on 1500 NuPlan and NuScenes samples using an NVIDIA L40S GPU, DISK achieves 2x speedup on trajectory diffusion and 1.6x speedup on video diffusion while maintaining L2 planning error, visual quality (FID/FVD), and NAVSIM PDMS scores, demonstrating practical long-horizon video-and-trajectory prediction at substantially reduced cost.</description>

      <title>Model Optimization for Multi-Camera 3D Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outside-in multi-camera perception is increasingly important in indoor environments, where networks of static cameras must support multi-target tracking under occlusion and heterogeneous viewpoints. We evaluate Sparse4D, a query-based spatiotemporal 3D detection and tracking framework that fuses multi-view features in a shared world frame and propagates sparse object queries via instance memory. We study reduced input frame rates, post-training quantization (INT8 and FP8), transfer to the WILDTRACK benchmark, and Transformer Engine mixed-precision fine-tuning. To better capture identity stability, we report Average Track Duration (AvgTrackDur), which measures identity persistence in seconds. Sparse4D remains stable under moderate FPS reductions, but below 2 FPS, identity association collapses even when detections are stable. Selective quantization of the backbone and neck offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off, while attention-related modules are consistently sensitive to low precision. On WILDTRACK, low-FPS pretraining yields large zero-shot gains over the base checkpoint, while small-scale fine-tuning provides limited additional benefit. Transformer Engine mixed precision reduces latency and improves camera scalability, but can destabilize identity propagation, motivating stability-aware validation.</description>

      <title>LatentLens: Revealing Highly Interpretable Visual Tokens in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming a large language model (LLM) into a Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be achieved by mapping the visual tokens from a vision encoder into the embedding space of an LLM. Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens. With LatentLens instead, the majority of visual tokens are interpretable across all studied models and all layers. Qualitatively, we show that the descriptions produced by LatentLens are semantically meaningful and provide more fine-grained interpretations for humans compared to individual tokens. More broadly, our findings contribute new evidence on the alignment between vision and language representations, opening up new directions for analyzing latent representations.</description>

      <title>PSGS: Text-driven Panorama Sliding Scene Generation via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic 3D scenes from text is crucial for immersive applications like VR, AR, and gaming. While text-driven approaches promise efficiency, existing methods suffer from limited 3D-text data and inconsistent multi-view stitching, resulting in overly simplistic scenes. To address this, we propose PSGS, a two-stage framework for high-fidelity panoramic scene generation. First, a novel two-layer optimization architecture generates semantically coherent panoramas: a layout reasoning layer parses text into structured spatial relationships, while a self-optimization layer refines visual details via iterative MLLM feedback. Second, our panorama sliding mechanism initializes globally consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting point clouds by strategically sampling overlapping perspectives. By incorporating depth and semantic coherence losses during training, we greatly improve the quality and detail fidelity of rendered scenes. Our experiments demonstrate that PSGS outperforms existing methods in panorama generation and produces more appealing 3D scenes, offering a robust solution for scalable immersive content creation.</description>

      <title>ZS-TreeSeg: A Zero-Shot Framework for Tree Crown Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual tree crown segmentation is an important task in remote sensing for forest biomass estimation and ecological monitoring. However, accurate delineation in dense, overlapping canopies remains a bottleneck. While supervised deep learning methods suffer from high annotation costs and limited generalization, emerging foundation models (e.g., Segment Anything Model) often lack domain knowledge, leading to under-segmentation in dense clusters. To bridge this gap, we propose ZS-TreeSeg, a Zero-Shot framework that adapts from two mature tasks: 1) Canopy Semantic segmentation; and 2) Cells instance segmentation. By modeling tree crowns as star-convex objects within a topological flow field using Cellpose-SAM, the ZS-TreeSeg framework forces the mathematical separation of touching tree crown instances based on vector convergence. Experiments on the NEON and BAMFOREST datasets and visual inspection demonstrate that our framework generalizes robustly across diverse sensor types and canopy densities, which can offer a training-free solution for tree crown instance segmentation and labels generation.</description>

      <title>GTATrack: Winner Solution to SoccerTrack 2025 with Deep-EIoU and Global Tracklet Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in sports is highly challenging due to irregular player motion, uniform appearances, and frequent occlusions. These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation. Our method achieved a winning HOTA score of 0.60 and significantly reduced false positives to 982, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy in fisheye-based soccer tracking. Our code is available at https://github.com/ron941/GTATrack-STC2025.</description>

      <title>Refining Strokes by Learning Offset Attributes between Strokes for Flexible Sketch Edit at Stroke-Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch edit at stroke-level aims to transplant source strokes onto a target sketch via stroke expansion or replacement, while preserving semantic consistency and visual fidelity with the target sketch. Recent studies addressed it by relocating source strokes at appropriate canvas positions. However, as source strokes could exhibit significant variations in both size and orientation, we may fail to produce plausible sketch editing results by merely repositioning them without further adjustments. For example, anchoring an oversized source stroke onto the target without proper scaling would fail to produce a semantically coherent outcome. In this paper, we propose SketchMod to refine the source stroke through transformation so as to align it with the target sketch's patterns, further realize flexible sketch edit at stroke-level. As the source stroke refinement is governed by the patterns of the target sketch, we learn three key offset attributes (scale, orientation and position) from the source stroke to another, and align it with the target by: 1) resizing to match spatial proportions by scale, 2) rotating to align with local geometry by orientation, and 3) displacing to meet with semantic layout by position. Besides, a stroke's profiles can be precisely controlled during sketch edit via the exposed captured stroke attributes. Experimental results indicate that SketchMod achieves precise and flexible performances on stroke-level sketch edit.</description>

      <title>HSSDCT: Factorized Spatial-Spectral Correlation for Hyperspectral Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion aims to reconstruct a high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI) by combining the rich spectral information of a low-resolution HSI (LR-HSI) with the fine spatial details of a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI). Although recent deep learning methods have achieved notable progress, they still suffer from limited receptive fields, redundant spectral bands, and the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which restrict both efficiency and robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Dense Correlation Network (HSSDCT). The framework introduces two key modules: (i) a Hierarchical Dense-Residue Transformer Block (HDRTB) that progressively enlarges windows and employs dense-residue connections for multi-scale feature aggregation, and (ii) a Spatial-Spectral Correlation Layer (SSCL) that explicitly factorizes spatial and spectral dependencies, reducing self-attention to linear complexity while mitigating spectral redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSSDCT delivers superior reconstruction quality with significantly lower computational costs, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in HSI fusion. Our code is available at https://github.com/jemmyleee/HSSDCT.</description>

      <title>RGBX-R1: Visual Modality Chain-of-Thought Guided Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are primarily pre-trained on the RGB modality, thereby limiting their performance on other modalities, such as infrared, depth, and event data, which are crucial for complex scenarios. To address this, we propose RGBX-R1, a framework to enhance MLLM's perception and reasoning capacities across various X visual modalities. Specifically, we employ an Understand-Associate-Validate (UAV) prompting strategy to construct the Visual Modality Chain-of-Thought (VM-CoT), which aims to expand the MLLMs' RGB understanding capability into X modalities. To progressively enhance reasoning capabilities, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm: Cold-Start Supervised Fine-Tuning (CS-SFT) and Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (ST-RFT). CS-SFT supervises the reasoning process with the guidance of VM-CoT, equipping the MLLM with fundamental modality cognition. Building upon GRPO, ST-RFT employs a Modality-understanding Spatio-Temporal (MuST) reward to reinforce modality reasoning. Notably, we construct the first RGBX-Grounding benchmark, and extensive experiments verify our superiority in multimodal understanding and spatial perception, outperforming baselines by 22.71% on three RGBX grounding tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Shortcuts: Facilitating Efficient Fusion in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and generation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in their ability to process data across multiple modalities. While most existing efforts focus on scaling up language models or constructing higher-quality training data, limited attention has been paid to effectively integrating cross-modal knowledge into the language space. In vision-language models, for instance, aligning modalities using only high-level visual features often discards the rich semantic information present in mid- and low-level features, limiting the model's ability of cross-modality understanding. To address this issue, we propose SparseCut, a general cross-modal fusion architecture for MLLMs, introducing sparse shortcut connections between the cross-modal encoder and the LLM. These shortcut connections enable the efficient and hierarchical integration of visual features at multiple levels, facilitating richer semantic fusion without increasing computational overhead. We further introduce an efficient multi-grained feature fusion module, which performs the fusion of visual features before routing them through the shortcuts. This preserves the original language context and does not increase the overall input length, thereby avoiding an increase in computational complexity for the LLM. Experiments demonstrate that SparseCut significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs across various multimodal benchmarks with generality and scalability for different base LLMs.</description>

      <title>DuoGen: Towards General Purpose Interleaved Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interleaved multimodal generation enables capabilities beyond unimodal generation models, such as step-by-step instructional guides, visual planning, and generating visual drafts for reasoning. However, the quality of existing interleaved generation models under general instructions remains limited by insufficient training data and base model capacity. We present DuoGen, a general-purpose interleaved generation framework that systematically addresses data curation, architecture design, and evaluation. On the data side, we build a large-scale, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset by combining multimodal conversations rewritten from curated raw websites, and diverse synthetic examples covering everyday scenarios. Architecturally, DuoGen leverages the strong visual understanding of a pretrained multimodal LLM and the visual generation capabilities of a diffusion transformer (DiT) pretrained on video generation, avoiding costly unimodal pretraining and enabling flexible base model selection. A two-stage decoupled strategy first instruction-tunes the MLLM, then aligns DiT with it using curated interleaved image-text sequences. Across public and newly proposed benchmarks, DuoGen outperforms prior open-source models in text quality, image fidelity, and image-context alignment, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on text-to-image and image editing among unified generation models. Data and code will be released at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/duetgen/.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Stochastic Propagation via Affinity-guided Random walK for training-free unsupervised segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that existing training-free segmentation methods rely on an implicit and limiting assumption, that segmentation is a spectral graph partitioning problem over diffusion-derived affinities. Such approaches, based on global graph partitioning and eigenvector-based formulations of affinity matrices, suffer from several fundamental drawbacks, they require pre-selecting the number of clusters, induce boundary oversmoothing due to spectral relaxation, and remain highly sensitive to noisy or multi-modal affinity distributions. Moreover, many prior works neglect the importance of local neighborhood structure, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing affinity propagation and preserving fine-grained contours. To address these limitations, we reformulate training-free segmentation as a stochastic flow equilibrium problem over diffusion-induced affinity graphs, where segmentation emerges from a stochastic propagation process that integrates global diffusion attention with local neighborhoods extracted from stable diffusion, yielding a sparse yet expressive affinity structure. Building on this formulation, we introduce a Markov propagation scheme that performs random-walk-based label diffusion with an adaptive pruning strategy that suppresses unreliable transitions while reinforcing confident affinity paths. Experiments across seven widely used semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, producing sharper boundaries, more coherent regions, and significantly more stable masks compared to prior spectral-clustering-based approaches.</description>

      <title>MRAD: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Memory-Driven Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) often leverages pretrained vision or vision-language models, but many existing methods use prompt learning or complex modeling to fit the data distribution, resulting in high training or inference cost and limited cross-domain stability. To address these limitations, we propose Memory-Retrieval Anomaly Detection method (MRAD), a unified framework that replaces parametric fitting with a direct memory retrieval. The train-free base model, MRAD-TF, freezes the CLIP image encoder and constructs a two-level memory bank (image-level and pixel-level) from auxiliary data, where feature-label pairs are explicitly stored as keys and values. During inference, anomaly scores are obtained directly by similarity retrieval over the memory bank. Based on the MRAD-TF, we further propose two lightweight variants as enhancements: (i) MRAD-FT fine-tunes the retrieval metric with two linear layers to enhance the discriminability between normal and anomaly; (ii) MRAD-CLIP injects the normal and anomalous region priors from the MRAD-FT as dynamic biases into CLIP's learnable text prompts, strengthening generalization to unseen categories. Across 16 industrial and medical datasets, the MRAD framework consistently demonstrates superior performance in anomaly classification and segmentation, under both train-free and training-based settings. Our work shows that fully leveraging the empirical distribution of raw data, rather than relying only on model fitting, can achieve stronger anomaly detection performance. The code will be publicly released at https://github.com/CROVO1026/MRAD.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Accelerating Vision-Language Models via Entropy-Guided Adaptive Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate inference in vision-language models (VLMs) by enabling parallel verification of multiple draft tokens. However, existing methods rely on static tree structures that remain fixed throughout the decoding process, failing to adapt to the varying prediction difficulty across generation steps. This leads to suboptimal acceptance lengths and limited speedup. In this paper, we propose SAGE, a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the speculation tree structure based on real-time prediction uncertainty. Our key insight is that output entropy serves as a natural confidence indicator with strong temporal correlation across decoding steps. SAGE constructs deeper-narrower trees for high-confidence predictions to maximize speculation depth, and shallower-wider trees for uncertain predictions to diversify exploration. SAGE improves acceptance lengths and achieves faster acceleration compared to static tree baselines. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SAGE: without any loss in output quality, it delivers up to $3.36\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and $3.18\times$ for Qwen2.5-VL-72B.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection through Multi-Level Fine-Grained Visual-Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional object detection systems are typically constrained to predefined categories, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments. In contrast, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables the identification of objects from novel classes not present in the training set. Recent advances in visual-language modeling have led to significant progress of OVD. However, prior works face challenges in either adapting the single-scale image backbone from CLIP to the detection framework or ensuring robust visual-language alignment. We propose Visual-Language Detection (VLDet), a novel framework that revamps feature pyramid for fine-grained visual-language alignment, leading to improved OVD performance. With the VL-PUB module, VLDet effectively exploits the visual-language knowledge from CLIP and adapts the backbone for object detection through feature pyramid. In addition, we introduce the SigRPN block, which incorporates a sigmoid-based anchor-text contrastive alignment loss to improve detection of novel categories. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves 58.7 AP for novel classes on COCO2017 and 24.8 AP on LVIS, surpassing all state-of-the-art methods and achieving significant improvements of 27.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Furthermore, VLDet also demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on closed-set object detection.</description>

      <title>SADER: Structure-Aware Diffusion Framework with DEterministic Resampling for Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Cloud Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud contamination severely degrades the usability of remote sensing imagery and poses a fundamental challenge for downstream Earth observation tasks. Recently, diffusion-based models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for remote sensing cloud removal due to their strong generative capability and stable optimization. However, existing diffusion-based approaches often suffer from limited sampling efficiency and insufficient exploitation of structural and temporal priors in multi-temporal remote sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose SADER, a structure-aware diffusion framework for multi-temporal remote sensing cloud removal. SADER first develops a scalable Multi-Temporal Conditional Diffusion Network (MTCDN) to fully capture multi-temporal and multimodal correlations via temporal fusion and hybrid attention. Then, a cloud-aware attention loss is introduced to emphasize cloud-dominated regions by accounting for cloud thickness and brightness discrepancies. In addition, a deterministic resampling strategy is designed for continuous diffusion models to iteratively refine samples under fixed sampling steps by replacing outliers through guided correction. Extensive experiments on multiple multi-temporal datasets demonstrate that SADER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cloud removal methods across all evaluation metrics. The code of SADER is publicly available at https://github.com/zyfzs0/SADER.</description>

      <title>NPNet: A Non-Parametric Network with Adaptive Gaussian-Fourier Positional Encoding for 3D Classification and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NPNet, a fully non-parametric approach for 3D point-cloud classification and part segmentation. NPNet contains no learned weights; instead, it builds point features using deterministic operators such as farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, and pooling. Our key idea is an adaptive Gaussian-Fourier positional encoding whose bandwidth and Gaussian-cosine mixing are chosen from the input geometry, helping the method remain stable across different scales and sampling densities. For segmentation, we additionally incorporate fixed-frequency Fourier features to provide global context alongside the adaptive encoding. Across ModelNet40/ModelNet-R, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, NPNet achieves strong performance among non-parametric baselines, and it is particularly effective in few-shot settings on ModelNet40. NPNet also offers favorable memory use and inference time compared to prior non-parametric methods</description>

      <title>Learning to Decode Against Compositional Hallucination in Video Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on video hallucination mitigation primarily focuses on isolated error types, leaving compositional hallucinations, arising from incorrect reasoning over multiple interacting spatial and temporal factors largely underexplored. We introduce OmniVCHall, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate both isolated and compositional hallucinations in video multimodal large language models (VLLMs). OmniVCHall spans diverse video domains, introduces a novel camera-based hallucination type, and defines a fine-grained taxonomy, together with adversarial answer options (e.g., "All are correct" and "None of the above") to prevent shortcut reasoning. The evaluations of 39 representative VLLMs reveal that even advanced models (e.g., Qwen3-VL and GPT-5) exhibit substantial performance degradation. We propose TriCD, a contrastive decoding framework with a triple-pathway calibration mechanism. An adaptive perturbation controller dynamically selects distracting operations to construct negative video variants, while a saliency-guided enhancement module adaptively reinforces grounded token-wise visual evidences. These components are optimized via reinforcement learning to encourage precise decision-making under compositional hallucination settings. Experimental results show that TriCD consistently improves performance across two representative backbones, achieving an average accuracy improvement of over 10%. The data and code can be find at https://github.com/BMRETURN/OmniVCHall.</description>

      <title>GLAD: Generative Language-Assisted Visual Tracking for Low-Semantic Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language tracking has gained increasing attention in many scenarios. This task simultaneously deals with visual and linguistic information to localize objects in videos. Despite its growing utility, the development of vision-language tracking methods remains in its early stage. Current vision-language trackers usually employ Transformer architectures for interactive integration of template, search, and text features. However, persistent challenges about low-semantic images including prevalent image blurriness, low resolution and so on, may compromise model performance through degraded cross-modal understanding. To solve this problem, language assistance is usually used to deal with the obstacles posed by low-semantic images. However, due to the existing gap between current textual and visual features, direct concatenation and fusion of these features may have limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering Generative Language-AssisteD tracking model, GLAD, which utilizes diffusion models for the generative multi-modal fusion of text description and template image to bolster compatibility between language and image and enhance template image semantic information. Our approach demonstrates notable improvements over the existing fusion paradigms. Blurry and semantically ambiguous template images can be restored to improve multi-modal features in the generative fusion paradigm. Experiments show that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks and achieves an impressive inference speed. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/Confetti-lxy/GLAD</description>

      <title>Bridging Degradation Discrimination and Generation for Universal Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal image restoration is a critical task in low-level vision, requiring the model to remove various degradations from low-quality images to produce clean images with rich detail. The challenges lie in sampling the distribution of high-quality images and adjusting the outputs on the basis of the degradation. This paper presents a novel approach, Bridging Degradation discrimination and Generation (BDG), which aims to address these challenges concurrently. First, we propose the Multi-Angle and multi-Scale Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (MAS-GLCM) and demonstrate its effectiveness in performing fine-grained discrimination of degradation types and levels. Subsequently, we divide the diffusion training process into three distinct stages: generation, bridging, and restoration. The objective is to preserve the diffusion model's capability of restoring rich textures while simultaneously integrating the discriminative information from the MAS-GLCM into the restoration process. This enhances its proficiency in addressing multi-task and multi-degraded scenarios. Without changing the architecture, BDG achieves significant performance gains in all-in-one restoration and real-world super-resolution tasks, primarily evidenced by substantial improvements in fidelity without compromising perceptual quality. The code and pretrained models are provided in https://github.com/MILab-PKU/BDG.</description>

      <title>MAUGen: A Unified Diffusion Approach for Multi-Identity Facial Expression and AU Label Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of large-scale, demographically diverse face images with precise Action Unit (AU) occurrence and intensity annotations has long been recognized as a fundamental bottleneck in developing generalizable AU recognition systems. In this paper, we propose MAUGen, a diffusion-based multi-modal framework that jointly generates a large collection of photorealistic facial expressions and anatomically consistent AU labels, including both occurrence and intensity, conditioned on a single descriptive text prompt. Our MAUGen involves two key modules: (1) a Multi-modal Representation Learning (MRL) module that captures the relationships among the paired textual description, facial identity, expression image, and AU activations within a unified latent space; and (2) a Diffusion-based Image label Generator (DIG) that decodes the joint representation into aligned facial image-label pairs across diverse identities. Under this framework, we introduce Multi-Identity Facial Action (MIFA), a large-scale multimodal synthetic dataset featuring comprehensive AU annotations and identity variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAUGen outperforms existing methods in synthesizing photorealistic, demographically diverse facial images along with semantically aligned AU labels.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Facts (Pix2Fact): Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning for Fine-Grained Visual Fact Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress on general tasks, VLMs struggle with challenges demanding both detailed visual grounding and deliberate knowledge-based reasoning, a synergy not captured by existing benchmarks that evaluate these skills separately. To close this gap, we introduce Pix2Fact, a new visual question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level perception and knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Pix2Fact contains 1,000 high-resolution (4K+) images spanning 8 daily-life scenarios and situations, with questions and answers meticulously crafted by annotators holding PhDs from top global universities working in partnership with a professional data annotation firm. Each question requires detailed visual grounding, multi-hop reasoning, and the integration of external knowledge to answer. Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs, including proprietary models like Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, reveals the substantial challenge posed by Pix2Fact: the most advanced model achieves only 24.0% average accuracy, in stark contrast to human performance of 56%. This significant gap underscores the limitations of current models in replicating human-level visual comprehension. We believe Pix2Fact will serve as a critical benchmark to drive the development of next-generation multimodal agents that combine fine-grained perception with robust, knowledge-based reasoning.</description>

      <title>Tune-Your-Style: Intensity-tunable 3D Style Transfer with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D style transfer refers to the artistic stylization of 3D assets based on reference style images. Recently, 3DGS-based stylization methods have drawn considerable attention, primarily due to their markedly enhanced training and rendering speeds. However, a vital challenge for 3D style transfer is to strike a balance between the content and the patterns and colors of the style. Although the existing methods strive to achieve relatively balanced outcomes, the fixed-output paradigm struggles to adapt to the diverse content-style balance requirements from different users. In this work, we introduce a creative intensity-tunable 3D style transfer paradigm, dubbed \textbf{Tune-Your-Style}, which allows users to flexibly adjust the style intensity injected into the scene to match their desired content-style balance, thus enhancing the customizability of 3D style transfer. To achieve this goal, we first introduce Gaussian neurons to explicitly model the style intensity and parameterize a learnable style tuner to achieve intensity-tunable style injection. To facilitate the learning of tunable stylization, we further propose the tunable stylization guidance, which obtains multi-view consistent stylized views from diffusion models through cross-view style alignment, and then employs a two-stage optimization strategy to provide stable and efficient guidance by modulating the balance between full-style guidance from the stylized views and zero-style guidance from the initial rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only delivers visually appealing results, but also exhibits flexible customizability for 3D style transfer.

      <title>Towards Interpretable Hallucination Analysis and Mitigation in LVLMs via Contrastive Neuron Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LVLMs achieve remarkable multimodal understanding and generation but remain susceptible to hallucinations. Existing mitigation methods predominantly focus on output-level adjustments, leaving the internal mechanisms that give rise to these hallucinations largely unexplored. To gain a deeper understanding, we adopt a representation-level perspective by introducing sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense visual embeddings into sparse, interpretable neurons. Through neuron-level analysis, we identify distinct neuron types, including always-on neurons and image-specific neurons. Our findings reveal that hallucinations often result from disruptions or spurious activations of image-specific neurons, while always-on neurons remain largely stable. Moreover, selectively enhancing or suppressing image-specific neurons enables controllable intervention in LVLM outputs, improving visual grounding and reducing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Neuron Steering (CNS), which identifies image-specific neurons via contrastive analysis between clean and noisy inputs. CNS selectively amplifies informative neurons while suppressing perturbation-induced activations, producing more robust and semantically grounded visual representations. This not only enhances visual understanding but also effectively mitigates hallucinations. By operating at the prefilling stage, CNS is fully compatible with existing decoding-stage methods. Extensive experiments on both hallucination-focused and general multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CNS consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving overall multimodal understanding.</description>

      <title>FaceSnap: Enhanced ID-fidelity Network for Tuning-free Portrait Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from the significant advancements in text-to-image diffusion models, research in personalized image generation, particularly customized portrait generation, has also made great strides recently. However, existing methods either require time-consuming fine-tuning and lack generalizability or fail to achieve high fidelity in facial details. To address these issues, we propose FaceSnap, a novel method based on Stable Diffusion (SD) that requires only a single reference image and produces extremely consistent results in a single inference stage. This method is plug-and-play and can be easily extended to different SD models. Specifically, we design a new Facial Attribute Mixer that can extract comprehensive fused information from both low-level specific features and high-level abstract features, providing better guidance for image generation. We also introduce a Landmark Predictor that maintains reference identity across landmarks with different poses, providing diverse yet detailed spatial control conditions for image generation. Then we use an ID-preserving module to inject these into the UNet. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs remarkably in personalized and customized portrait generation, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods in this domain.</description>

      <title>S$^3$POT: Contrast-Driven Face Occlusion Segmentation via Self-Supervised Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing face parsing methods usually misclassify occlusions as facial components. This is because occlusion is a high-level concept, it does not refer to a concrete category of object. Thus, constructing a real-world face dataset covering all categories of occlusion object is almost impossible and accurate mask annotation is labor-intensive. To deal with the problems, we present S$^3$POT, a contrast-driven framework synergizing face generation with self-supervised spatial prompting, to achieve occlusion segmentation. The framework is inspired by the insights: 1) Modern face generators' ability to realistically reconstruct occluded regions, creating an image that preserve facial geometry while eliminating occlusion, and 2) Foundation segmentation models' (e.g., SAM) capacity to extract precise mask when provided with appropriate prompts. In particular, S$^3$POT consists of three modules: Reference Generation (RF), Feature enhancement (FE), and Prompt Selection (PS). First, a reference image is produced by RF using structural guidance from parsed mask. Second, FE performs contrast of tokens between raw and reference images to obtain an initial prompt, then modifies image features with the prompt by cross-attention. Third, based on the enhanced features, PS constructs a set of positive and negative prompts and screens them with a self-attention network for a mask decoder. The network is learned under the guidance of three novel and complementary objective functions without occlusion ground truth mask involved. Extensive experiments on a dedicatedly collected dataset demonstrate S$^3$POT's superior performance and the effectiveness of each module.</description>

      <title>VIZOR: Viewpoint-Invariant Zero-Shot Scene Graph Generation for 3D Scene Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene understanding and reasoning has been a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision, requiring models to identify objects, their properties, and spatial or comparative relationships among the objects. Existing approaches enable this by creating scene graphs using multiple inputs such as 2D images, depth maps, object labels, and annotated relationships from specific reference view. However, these methods often struggle with generalization and produce inaccurate spatial relationships like "left/right", which become inconsistent across different viewpoints. To address these limitations, we propose Viewpoint-Invariant Zero-shot scene graph generation for 3D scene Reasoning (VIZOR). VIZOR is a training-free, end-to-end framework that constructs dense, viewpoint-invariant 3D scene graphs directly from raw 3D scenes. The generated scene graph is unambiguous, as spatial relationships are defined relative to each object's front-facing direction, making them consistent regardless of the reference view. Furthermore, it infers open-vocabulary relationships that describe spatial and proximity relationships among scene objects without requiring annotated training data. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations to assess the effectiveness of VIZOR in scene graph generation and downstream tasks, such as query-based object grounding. VIZOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing clear improvements in scene graph generation and achieving 22% and 4.81% gains in zero-shot grounding accuracy on the Replica and Nr3D datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Diff-PC: Identity-preserving and 3D-aware Controllable Diffusion for Zero-shot Portrait Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portrait customization (PC) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential applications. However, existing PC methods lack precise identity (ID) preservation and face control. To address these tissues, we propose Diff-PC, a diffusion-based framework for zero-shot PC, which generates realistic portraits with high ID fidelity, specified facial attributes, and diverse backgrounds. Specifically, our approach employs the 3D face predictor to reconstruct the 3D-aware facial priors encompassing the reference ID, target expressions, and poses. To capture fine-grained face details, we design ID-Encoder that fuses local and global facial features. Subsequently, we devise ID-Ctrl using the 3D face to guide the alignment of ID features. We further introduce ID-Injector to enhance ID fidelity and facial controllability. Finally, training on our collected ID-centric dataset improves face similarity and text-to-image (T2I) alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-PC surpasses state-of-the-art methods in ID preservation, facial control, and T2I consistency. Furthermore, our method is compatible with multi-style foundation models.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mamba-SAM Architecture for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images such as MRI and CT is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide powerful general-purpose representations but struggle in medical imaging due to domain shift, their inherently 2D design, and the high computational cost of fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-SAM, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that combines a frozen SAM encoder with the linear-time efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities of Mamba-based State Space Models (SSMs). We investigate two parameter-efficient adaptation strategies. The first is a dual-branch architecture that explicitly fuses general features from a frozen SAM encoder with domain-specific representations learned by a trainable VMamba encoder using cross-attention. The second is an adapter-based approach that injects lightweight, 3D-aware Tri-Plane Mamba (TPMamba) modules into the frozen SAM ViT encoder to implicitly model volumetric context. Within this framework, we introduce Multi-Frequency Gated Convolution (MFGC), which enhances feature representation by jointly analyzing spatial and frequency-domain information via 3D discrete cosine transforms and adaptive gating. Extensive experiments on the ACDC cardiac MRI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The dual-branch Mamba-SAM-Base model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.906, comparable to UNet++ (0.907), while outperforming all baselines on Myocardium (0.910) and Left Ventricle (0.971) segmentation. The adapter-based TP MFGC variant offers superior inference speed (4.77 FPS) with strong accuracy (0.880 Dice). These results show that hybridizing foundation models with efficient SSM-based architectures provides a practical and effective solution for 3D medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Non-Contrastive Vision-Language Learning with Predictive Embedding Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have transformed multimodal representation learning, yet dominant contrastive approaches like CLIP require large batch sizes, careful negative sampling, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce NOVA, a NOn-contrastive Vision-language Alignment framework based on joint embedding prediction with distributional regularization. NOVA aligns visual representations to a frozen, domain-specific text encoder by predicting text embeddings from augmented image views, while enforcing an isotropic Gaussian structure via Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). This eliminates the need for negative sampling, momentum encoders, or stop-gradients, reducing the training objective to a single hyperparameter. We evaluate NOVA on zeroshot chest X-ray classification using ClinicalBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformers trained from scratch on MIMIC-CXR. On zero-shot classification across three benchmark datasets, NOVA outperforms multiple standard baselines while exhibiting substantially more consistent training runs. Our results demonstrate that non-contrastive vision-language pretraining offers a simpler, more stable, and more effective alternative to contrastive methods.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger-Inspired Time-Evolution for 4D Deformation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting of complex three-dimensional phenomena (4D: 3D + time) is fundamental to applications in medical imaging, fluid and material dynamics, and geophysics. In contrast to unconstrained neural forecasting models, we propose a Schr\"odinger-inspired, physics-guided neural architecture that embeds an explicit time-evolution operator within a deep convolutional framework for 4D prediction. From observed volumetric sequences, the model learns voxelwise amplitude, phase, and potential fields that define a complex-valued wavefunction $\psi = A e^{i\phi}$, which is evolved forward in time using a differentiable, unrolled Schr\"odinger time stepper. This physics-guided formulation yields several key advantages: (i) temporal stability arising from the structured evolution operator, which mitigates drift and error accumulation in long-horizon forecasting; (ii) an interpretable latent representation, where phase encodes transport dynamics, amplitude captures structural intensity, and the learned potential governs spatiotemporal interactions; and (iii) natural compatibility with deformation-based synthesis, which is critical for preserving anatomical fidelity in medical imaging applications. By integrating physical priors directly into the learning process, the proposed approach combines the expressivity of deep networks with the robustness and interpretability of physics-based modeling. We demonstrate accurate and stable prediction of future 4D states, including volumetric intensities and deformation fields, on synthetic benchmarks that emulate realistic shape deformations and topological changes. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end 4D neural forecasting framework to incorporate a Schr\"odinger-type evolution operator, offering a principled pathway toward interpretable, stable, and anatomically consistent spatiotemporal prediction.</description>

      <title>Improving Neuropathological Reconstruction Fidelity via AI Slice Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuropathological analyses benefit from spatially precise volumetric reconstructions that enhance anatomical delineation and improve morphometric accuracy. Our prior work has shown the feasibility of reconstructing 3D brain volumes from 2D dissection photographs. However these outputs sometimes exhibit coarse, overly smooth reconstructions of structures, especially under high anisotropy (i.e., reconstructions from thick slabs). Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging. Our method is publicly available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_3d_photo_recon</description>

      <title>HPC: Hierarchical Point-based Latent Representation for Streaming Dynamic Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dynamic Gaussian Splatting has driven significant advances in free-viewpoint video, maintaining its rendering quality with a small memory footprint for efficient streaming transmission still presents an ongoing challenge. Existing streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression methods typically leverage a latent representation to drive the neural network for predicting Gaussian residuals between frames. Their core latent representations can be categorized into structured grid-based and unstructured point-based paradigms. However, the former incurs significant parameter redundancy by inevitably modeling unoccupied space, while the latter suffers from limited compactness as it fails to exploit local correlations. To relieve these limitations, we propose HPC, a novel streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting compression framework. It employs a hierarchical point-based latent representation that operates on a per-Gaussian basis to avoid parameter redundancy in unoccupied space. Guided by a tailored aggregation scheme, these latent points achieve high compactness with low spatial redundancy. To improve compression efficiency, we further undertake the first investigation to compress neural networks for streaming dynamic Gaussian Splatting through mining and exploiting the inter-frame correlation of parameters. Combined with latent compression, this forms a fully end-to-end compression framework. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HPC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It achieves a storage reduction of 67% against its baseline while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity.</description>

      <title>Video Understanding: Through A Temporal Lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the central question of how to leverage temporal relations among video elements to advance video understanding. Addressing the limitations of existing methods, the work presents a five-fold contribution: (1) an automatic annotation framework that utilizes large vision-language models and a noise-robust contrastive learning objective with a subtractive angular margin; (2) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy using "recurrent adapters" to capture temporal dynamics in low-data regimes; (3) the integration of State Space Layers (SSL) for efficient long-form video modeling, supported by the introduction of two new long-term benchmarks for egocentric and feature-length content; (4) a novel contrastive learning framework designed to explicitly model fine-grained relations between motions and video moments; and (5) a comprehensive empirical study on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that identifies the visual-language interface as a bottleneck for temporal reasoning, leading to a new "temporal-oriented recipe" for upscaled video understanding. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate that explicit temporal modeling significantly enhances a model's ability to represent and reason about the fluid nature of video content.</description>

      <title>V2X-DSC: Multi-Agent Collaborative Perception with Distributed Source Coding Guided Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception improves 3D understanding by fusing multi-agent observations, yet intermediate-feature sharing faces strict bandwidth constraints as dense BEV features saturate V2X links. We observe that collaborators view the same physical world, making their features strongly correlated; thus receivers only need innovation beyond their local context. Revisiting this from a distributed source coding perspective, we propose V2X-DSC, a framework with a Conditional Codec (DCC) for bandwidth-constrained fusion. The sender compresses BEV features into compact codes, while the receiver performs conditional reconstruction using its local features as side information, allocating bits to complementary cues rather than redundant content. This conditional structure regularizes learning, encouraging incremental representation and yielding lower-noise features. Experiments on DAIR-V2X, OPV2V, and V2X-Real demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-bandwidth trade-offs under KB-level communication, and generalizes as a plug-and-play communication layer across multiple fusion backbones.</description>

      <title>JoyAvatar: Unlocking Highly Expressive Avatars via Harmonized Text-Audio Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video avatar models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in scenarios such as talking, public speaking, and singing. However, the majority of these methods exhibit limited alignment with respect to text instructions, particularly when the prompts involve complex elements including large full-body movement, dynamic camera trajectory, background transitions, or human-object interactions. To break out this limitation, we present JoyAvatar, a framework capable of generating long duration avatar videos, featuring two key technical innovations. Firstly, we introduce a twin-teacher enhanced training algorithm that enables the model to transfer inherent text-controllability from the foundation model while simultaneously learning audio-visual synchronization. Secondly, during training, we dynamically modulate the strength of multi-modal conditions (e.g., audio and text) based on the distinct denoising timestep, aiming to mitigate conflicts between the heterogeneous conditioning signals. These two key designs serve to substantially expand the avatar model's capacity to generate natural, temporally coherent full-body motions and dynamic camera movements as well as preserve the basic avatar capabilities, such as accurate lip-sync and identity consistency. GSB evaluation results demonstrate that our JoyAvatar model outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as Omnihuman-1.5 and KlingAvatar 2.0. Moreover, our approach enables complex applications including multi-person dialogues and non-human subjects role-playing. Some video samples are provided on https://joyavatar.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorghum is a globally important cereal grown widely in water-limited and stress-prone regions. Its strong drought tolerance makes it a priority crop for climate-resilient agriculture. Improving water-use efficiency in sorghum requires precise characterisation of stomatal traits, as stomata control of gas exchange, transpiration and photosynthesis have a major influence on crop performance. Automated analysis of sorghum stomata is difficult because the stomata are small (often less than 40 $\mu$m in length in grasses such as sorghum) and vary in shape across genotypes and leaf surfaces. Automated segmentation contributes to high-throughput stomatal phenotyping, yet current methods still face challenges related to nested small structures and annotation bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised instance segmentation framework tailored for analysis of sorghum stomatal components. We collect and annotate a sorghum leaf imagery dataset containing 11,060 human-annotated patches, covering the three stomatal components (pore, guard cell and complex area) across multiple genotypes and leaf surfaces. To improve the detection of tiny structures, we split high-resolution microscopy images into overlapping small patches. We then apply a pseudo-labelling strategy to unannotated images, producing an additional 56,428 pseudo-labelled patches. Benchmarking across semantic and instance segmentation models shows substantial performance gains: for semantic models the top mIoU increases from 65.93% to 70.35%, whereas for instance models the top AP rises from 28.30% to 46.10%. These results demonstrate that combining patch-based preprocessing with semi-supervised learning significantly improves the segmentation of fine stomatal structures. The proposed framework supports scalable extraction of stomatal traits and facilitates broader adoption of AI-driven phenotyping in crop science.</description>

      <title>Supervised makeup transfer with a curated dataset: Decoupling identity and makeup features for enhanced transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong progress in generative tasks, offering a more stable alternative to GAN-based approaches for makeup transfer. Existing methods often suffer from limited datasets, poor disentanglement between identity and makeup features, and weak controllability. To address these issues, we make three contributions. First, we construct a curated high-quality dataset using a train-generate-filter-retrain strategy that combines synthetic, realistic, and filtered samples to improve diversity and fidelity. Second, we design a diffusion-based framework that disentangles identity and makeup features, ensuring facial structure and skin tone are preserved while applying accurate and diverse cosmetic styles. Third, we propose a text-guided mechanism that allows fine-grained and region-specific control, enabling users to modify eyes, lips, or face makeup with natural language prompts. Experiments on benchmarks and real-world scenarios demonstrate improvements in fidelity, identity preservation, and flexibility. Examples of our dataset can be found at: https://makeup-adapter.github.io.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Inter-Outer Surface Separation for Point Clouds with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion-based algorithm for separating the inter and outer layer surfaces from double-layered point clouds, particularly those exhibiting the "double surface artifact" caused by truncation in Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) fusion during indoor or medical 3D reconstruction. This artifact arises from asymmetric truncation thresholds, leading to erroneous inter and outer shells in the fused volume, which our method addresses by extracting the true inter layer to mitigate challenges like overlapping surfaces and disordered normals. We focus on point clouds with \emph{open boundaries} (i.e., sampled surfaces with topological openings/holes through which particles may escape), rather than point clouds with \emph{missing surface regions} where no samples exist. Our approach enables robust processing of both watertight and open-boundary models, achieving extraction of the inter layer from 20,000 inter and 20,000 outer points in approximately 10 seconds. This solution is particularly effective for applications requiring accurate surface representations, such as indoor scene modeling and medical imaging, where double-layered point clouds are prevalent, and it accommodates both closed (watertight) and open-boundary surface geometries. Our goal is \emph{post-hoc} inter/outer shell separation as a lightweight module after TSDF fusion; we do not aim to replace full variational or learning-based reconstruction pipelines.</description>

      <title>HSI-VAR: Rethinking Hyperspectral Restoration through Spatial-Spectral Visual Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) capture richer spatial-spectral information beyond RGB, yet real-world HSIs often suffer from a composite mix of degradations, such as noise, blur, and missing bands. Existing generative approaches for HSI restoration like diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps, making them computationally impractical for high-dimensional HSIs. While regression models tend to produce oversmoothed results, failing to preserve critical structural details. We break this impasse by introducing HSI-VAR, rethinking HSI restoration as an autoregressive generation problem, where spectral and spatial dependencies can be progressively modeled rather than globally reconstructed. HSI-VAR incorporates three key innovations: (1) Latent-condition alignment, which couples semantic consistency between latent priors and conditional embeddings for precise reconstruction; (2) Degradation-aware guidance, which uniquely encodes mixed degradations as linear combinations in the embedding space for automatic control, remarkably achieving a nearly $50\%$ reduction in computational cost at inference; (3) A spatial-spectral adaptation module that refines details across both domains in the decoding phase. Extensive experiments on nine all-in-one HSI restoration benchmarks confirm HSI-VAR's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3.77 dB PSNR improvement on \textbf{\textit{ICVL}} and offering superior structure preservation with an inference speed-up of up to $95.5 \times$ compared with diffusion-based methods, making it a highly practical solution for real-world HSI restoration.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deep Learning-Based Nerve Segmentation in Brachial Plexus Ultrasound Under Realistic Data Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate nerve localization is critical for the success of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia, yet manual identification remains challenging due to low image contrast, speckle noise, and inter-patient anatomical variability. This study evaluates deep learning-based nerve segmentation in ultrasound images of the brachial plexus using a U-Net architecture, with a focus on how dataset composition and annotation strategy influence segmentation performance. We find that training on combined data from multiple ultrasound machines (SIEMENS ACUSON NX3 Elite and Philips EPIQ5) provides regularization benefits for lower-performing acquisition sources, though it does not surpass single-source training when matched to the target domain. Extending the task from binary nerve segmentation to multi-class supervision (artery, vein, nerve, muscle) results in decreased nerve-specific Dice scores, with performance drops ranging from 9% to 61% depending on dataset, likely due to class imbalance and boundary ambiguity. Additionally, we observe a moderate positive correlation between nerve size and segmentation accuracy (Pearson r=0.587, p&lt;0.001), indicating that smaller nerves remain a primary challenge. These findings provide methodological guidance for developing robust ultrasound nerve segmentation systems under realistic clinical data constraints.</description>

      <title>DVLA-RL: Dual-Level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning Gating for Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to generalize to novel categories with only a few samples. Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.</description>

      <title>Any3D-VLA: Enhancing VLA Robustness via Diverse Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically take 2D images as visual input, which limits their spatial understanding in complex scenes. How can we incorporate 3D information to enhance VLA capabilities? We conduct a pilot study across different observation spaces and visual representations. The results show that explicitly lifting visual input into point clouds yields representations that better complement their corresponding 2D representations. To address the challenges of (1) scarce 3D data and (2) the domain gap induced by cross-environment differences and depth-scale biases, we propose Any3D-VLA. It unifies the simulator, sensor, and model-estimated point clouds within a training pipeline, constructs diverse inputs, and learns domain-agnostic 3D representations that are fused with the corresponding 2D representations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate Any3D-VLA's advantages in improving performance and mitigating the domain gap.

      <title>VVLoc: Prior-free 3-DoF Vehicle Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization is a critical technology in autonomous driving, encompassing both topological localization, which identifies the most similar map keyframe to the current observation, and metric localization, which provides precise spatial coordinates. Conventional methods typically address these tasks independently, rely on single-camera setups, and often require additional 3D semantic or pose priors, while lacking mechanisms to quantify the confidence of localization results, making them less feasible for real industrial applications. In this paper, we propose VVLoc, a unified pipeline that employs a single neural network to concurrently achieve topological and metric vehicle localization using multi-camera system. VVLoc first evaluates the geo-proximity between visual observations, then estimates their relative metric poses using a matching strategy, while also providing a confidence measure. Additionally, the training process for VVLoc is highly efficient, requiring only pairs of visual data and corresponding ground-truth poses, eliminating the need for complex supplementary data. We evaluate VVLoc not only on the publicly available datasets, but also on a more challenging self-collected dataset, demonstrating its ability to deliver state-of-the-art localization accuracy across a wide range of localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Generating a Paracosm for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from a database using a multimodal query, which consists of a reference image and a modification text. The text specifies how to alter the reference image to form a ``mental image'', based on which CIR should find the target image in the database. The fundamental challenge of CIR is that this ``mental image'' is not physically available and is only implicitly defined by the query. The contemporary literature pursues zero-shot methods and uses a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to generate a textual description for a given multimodal query, and then employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for textual-visual matching to search the target image. In contrast, we address CIR from first principles by directly generating the ``mental image'' for more accurate matching. Particularly, we prompt an LMM to generate a ``mental image'' for a given multimodal query and propose to use this ``mental image'' to search for the target image. As the ``mental image'' has a synthetic-to-real domain gap with real images, we also generate a synthetic counterpart for each real image in the database to facilitate matching. In this sense, our method uses LMM to construct a ``paracosm'', where it matches the multimodal query and database images. Hence, we call this method Paracosm. Notably, Paracosm is a training-free zero-shot CIR method. It significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods on four challenging benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot CIR.</description>

      <title>Edge-Native Generative De-identification: Inversion-Free Flow for Privacy-Preserving Federated Skin Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Federated Learning (FL) for clinical dermatology is hindered by the competing requirements of protecting patient privacy and preserving diagnostic features. Traditional de-identification methods often degrade pathological fidelity, while standard generative editing techniques rely on computationally intensive inversion processes unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. We propose a framework for identity-agnostic pathology preservation that serves as a client-side privacy-preserving utility. By leveraging inversion-free Rectified Flow Transformers (FlowEdit), the system performs high-fidelity identity transformation in near real-time (less than 20s), facilitating local deployment on clinical nodes. We introduce a "Segment-by-Synthesis" mechanism that generates counterfactual healthy and pathological twin pairs locally. This enables the extraction of differential erythema masks that are decoupled from biometric markers and semantic artifacts (e.g. jewelry). Pilot validation on high-resolution clinical samples demonstrates an Intersection over Union (IoU) stability greater than 0.67 across synthetic identities. By generating privacy-compliant synthetic surrogates at the edge, this framework mitigates the risk of gradient leakage at the source, providing a secure pathway for high-precision skin image analysis in federated environments.</description>

      <title>TransNormal: Dense Visual Semantics for Diffusion-based Transparent Object Normal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular normal estimation for transparent objects is critical for laboratory automation, yet it remains challenging due to complex light refraction and reflection. These optical properties often lead to catastrophic failures in conventional depth and normal sensors, hindering the deployment of embodied AI in scientific environments. We propose TransNormal, a novel framework that adapts pre-trained diffusion priors for single-step normal regression. To handle the lack of texture in transparent surfaces, TransNormal integrates dense visual semantics from DINOv3 via a cross-attention mechanism, providing strong geometric cues. Furthermore, we employ a multi-task learning objective and wavelet-based regularization to ensure the preservation of fine-grained structural details. To support this task, we introduce TransNormal-Synthetic, a physics-based dataset with high-fidelity normal maps for transparent labware. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransNormal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods: on the ClearGrasp benchmark, it reduces mean error by 24.4% and improves 11.25{\deg} accuracy by 22.8%; on ClearPose, it achieves a 15.2% reduction in mean error. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TransNormal.</description>

      <title>Invariance on Manifolds: Understanding Robust Visual Representations for Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) demands representations robust to drastic environmental and viewpoint shifts. Current aggregation paradigms, however, either rely on data-hungry supervision or simplistic first-order statistics, often neglecting intrinsic structural correlations. In this work, we propose a Second-Order Geometric Statistics framework that inherently captures geometric stability without training. We conceptualize scenes as covariance descriptors on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, where perturbations manifest as tractable congruence transformations. By leveraging geometry-aware Riemannian mappings, we project these descriptors into a linearized Euclidean embedding, effectively decoupling signal structure from noise. Our approach introduces a training-free framework built upon fixed, pre-trained backbones, achieving strong zero-shot generalization without parameter updates. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly excelling in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distill3R: A Pipeline for Democratizing 3D Foundation Models on Commodity Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multi-view 3D reconstruction has shifted toward large-scale foundation models capable of inferring globally consistent geometry, their reliance on massive computational clusters for training has created a significant barrier to entry for most academic laboratories. To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment. This work is not intended to compete with state-of-the-art foundation models, but to provide an accessible research baseline for laboratories without access to large-scale compute to train and specialize models on their own domain-specific data at minimal cost.</description>

      <title>DIAMOND: Directed Inference for Artifact Mitigation in Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite impressive results from recent text-to-image models like FLUX, visual and anatomical artifacts remain a significant hurdle for practical and professional use. Existing methods for artifact reduction, typically work in a post-hoc manner, consequently failing to intervene effectively during the core image formation process. Notably, current techniques require problematic and invasive modifications to the model weights, or depend on a computationally expensive and time-consuming process of regional refinement. To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

      <description>arXiv:2602.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to transformers due to their unique ability of modeling global relationships in text with linear complexity. However, their success in vision tasks has been limited due to their causal formulation, which is suitable for sequential text but detrimental in the spatial domain where causality breaks the inherent spatial relationships among pixels or patches. As a result, standard SSMs fail to capture local spatial coherence, often linking non-adjacent patches while ignoring neighboring ones that are visually correlated. To address these limitations, we introduce OCTOPUS , a novel architecture that preserves both global context and local spatial structure within images, while maintaining the linear complexity of SSMs. OCTOPUS performs discrete reoccurrence along eight principal orientations, going forward or backward in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, allowing effective information exchange across all spatially connected regions while maintaining independence among unrelated patches. This design enables multi-directional recurrence, capturing both global context and local spatial structure with SSM-level efficiency. In our classification and segmentation benchmarks, OCTOPUS demonstrates notable improvements in boundary preservation and region consistency, as evident from the segmentation results, while maintaining relatively better classification accuracy compared to existing V-SSM based models. These results suggest that OCTOPUS appears as a foundation method for multi-directional recurrence as a scalable and effective mechanism for building spatially aware and computationally efficient vision architectures.</description>

      <title>ConsensusDrop: Fusing Visual and Cross-Modal Saliency for Efficient Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are expensive because the LLM processes hundreds of largely redundant visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods typically exploit \textit{either} vision-encoder saliency (broad but query-agnostic) \textit{or} LLM cross-attention (query-aware but sparse and costly). We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking). However, making such fusion practical is non-trivial: cross-modal saliency is usually only available \emph{inside} the LLM (too late for efficient pre-LLM pruning), and the two signals are inherently asymmetric, so naive fusion underutilizes their complementary strengths. We propose \textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint. Our code will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for High-Fidelity Generation of CAR-T/NK Immunological Synapse Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and NK cell immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment, and recent studies suggest that the quality of the CAR-T/NK cell immunological synapse (IS) may serve as a functional biomarker for predicting therapeutic efficacy. Accurate detection and segmentation of CAR-T/NK IS structures using artificial neural networks (ANNs) can greatly increase the speed and reliability of IS quantification. However, a persistent challenge is the limited size of annotated microscopy datasets, which restricts the ability of ANNs to generalize. To address this challenge, we integrate two complementary data-augmentation frameworks. First, we employ Instance Aware Automatic Augmentation (IAAA), an automated, instance-preserving augmentation method that generates synthetic CAR-T/NK IS images and corresponding segmentation masks by applying optimized augmentation policies to original IS data. IAAA supports multiple imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence and brightfield) and can be applied directly to CAR-T/NK IS images derived from patient samples. In parallel, we introduce a Semantic-Aware AI Augmentation (SAAA) pipeline that combines a diffusion-based mask generator with a Pix2Pix conditional image synthesizer. This second method enables the creation of diverse, anatomically realistic segmentation masks and produces high-fidelity CAR-T/NK IS images aligned with those masks, further expanding the training corpus beyond what IAAA alone can provide. Together, these augmentation strategies generate synthetic images whose visual and structural properties closely match real IS data, significantly improving CAR-T/NK IS detection and segmentation performance. By enhancing the robustness and accuracy of IS quantification, this work supports the development of more reliable imaging-based biomarkers for predicting patient response to CAR-T/NK immunotherapy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Topological and Deep Feature Fusion for Accurate MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Severity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging-based clinical decision support systems. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with a DenseNet121 backbone for four-class Alzheimer's disease classification using structural MRI data from the OASIS dataset. TDA is employed to capture complementary topological characteristics of brain structures that are often overlooked by conventional neural networks, while DenseNet121 efficiently learns hierarchical spatial features from MRI slices. The extracted deep and topological features are fused to enhance class separability across the four AD stages.
  Extensive experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 Kaggle MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed TDA+DenseNet121 model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. The model achieves an accuracy of 99.93% and an AUC of 100%, surpassing recently published CNN-based, transfer learning, ensemble, and multi-scale architectures. These results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating topological insights into deep learning pipelines and highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a robust and highly accurate tool for automated Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cognitive Compass: Theory-of-Mind-Guided Multimodal Emotion Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their capability for deep emotional understanding remains limited. We argue that genuine affective intelligence requires explicit modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM), the cognitive substrate from which emotions arise. To this end, we introduce HitEmotion, a ToM-grounded hierarchical benchmark that diagnoses capability breakpoints across increasing levels of cognitive depth. Second, we propose a ToM-guided reasoning chain that tracks mental states and calibrates cross-modal evidence to achieve faithful emotional reasoning. We further introduce TMPO, a reinforcement learning method that uses intermediate mental states as process-level supervision to guide and strengthen model reasoning. Extensive experiments show that HitEmotion exposes deep emotional reasoning deficits in state-of-the-art models, especially on cognitively demanding tasks. In evaluation, the ToM-guided reasoning chain and TMPO improve end-task accuracy and yield more faithful, more coherent rationales. In conclusion, our work provides the research community with a practical toolkit for evaluating and enhancing the cognition-based emotional understanding capabilities of MLLMs. Our dataset and code are available at: https://HitEmotion.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Navigating Simply, Aligning Deeply: Winning Solutions for Mouse vs. AI 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.</description>

      <title>VAMOS-OCTA: Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision for Inpainting Motion-Corrupted OCT Angiography Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handheld Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) enables noninvasive retinal imaging in uncooperative or pediatric subjects, but is highly susceptible to motion artifacts that severely degrade volumetric image quality. Sudden motion during 3D acquisition can lead to unsampled retinal regions across entire B-scans (cross-sectional slices), resulting in blank bands in en face projections. We propose VAMOS-OCTA, a deep learning framework for inpainting motion-corrupted B-scans using vessel-aware multi-axis supervision. We employ a 2.5D U-Net architecture that takes a stack of neighboring B-scans as input to reconstruct a corrupted center B-scan, guided by a novel Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision (VAMOS) loss. This loss combines vessel-weighted intensity reconstruction with axial and lateral projection consistency, encouraging vascular continuity in native B-scans and across orthogonal planes. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on restoring the en face MIP, VAMOS-OCTA jointly enhances both cross-sectional B-scan sharpness and volumetric projection accuracy, even under severe motion corruptions. We trained our model on both synthetic and real-world corrupted volumes and evaluated its performance using both perceptual quality and pixel-wise accuracy metrics. VAMOS-OCTA consistently outperforms prior methods, producing reconstructions with sharp capillaries, restored vessel continuity, and clean en face projections. These results demonstrate that multi-axis supervision offers a powerful constraint for restoring motion-degraded 3D OCTA data.

      <title>CortiNet: A Physics-Perception Hybrid Cortical-Inspired Dual-Stream Network for Gallbladder Disease Diagnosis from Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is the primary diagnostic modality for detecting Gallbladder diseases due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and wide accessibility. However, the low resolution and speckle noise inherent to ultrasound images hinder diagnostic reliability, prompting the use of large convolutional neural networks that are difficult to deploy in routine clinical settings. In this work, we propose CortiNet, a lightweight, cortical-inspired dual-stream neural architecture for gallbladder disease diagnosis that integrates physically interpretable multi-scale signal decomposition with perception-driven feature learning. Inspired by parallel processing pathways in the human visual cortex, CortiNet explicitly separates low-frequency structural information from high-frequency perceptual details and processes them through specialized encoding streams. By operating directly on structured, frequency-selective representations rather than raw pixel intensities, the architecture embeds strong physics-based inductive bias, enabling efficient feature learning with a significantly reduced parameter footprint. A late-stage cortical-style fusion mechanism integrates complementary structural and textural cues while preserving computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose a structure-aware explainability framework wherein gradient-weighted class activation mapping is only applied to the structural branch of the proposed CortiNet architecture. This choice allows the model to only focus on the structural features, making it robust against speckle noise. We evaluate CortiNet on 10,692 expert-annotated images spanning nine clinically relevant gallbladder disease categories. Experimental results demonstrate that CortiNet achieves high diagnostic accuracy (98.74%) with only a fraction of the parameters required by conventional deep convolutional models.</description>

      <title>SRVAU-R1: Enhancing Video Anomaly Understanding via Reflection-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in reasoning capabilities and shown promising effectiveness in video anomaly understanding (VAU) tasks. However, existing MLLM-based approaches remain largely focused on surface-level descriptions of anomalies, lacking deep reasoning over abnormal behaviors like explicit self-reflection and self-correction. To address that, we propose Self-Reflection-Enhanced Reasoning for Video Anomaly Understanding (SRVAU-R1), a reflection-aware learning framework that incorporates reflection in MLLM reasoning. Specifically, SRVAU-R1 introduces the first reflection-oriented Chain-of-Thought dataset tailored for VAU, providing structured supervision with initial reasoning, self-reflection, and revised reasoning. Based on that, it includes a novel reflection-aware learning paradigm with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance multi-modal reasoning for VAU. Extensive experiments on multiple video anomaly benchmarks demonstrate that SRVAU-R1 consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in both temporal anomaly localization accuracy and reasoning quality.</description>

      <title>LocalScore: Local Density-Aware Similarity Scoring for Biometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set biometrics faces challenges with probe subjects who may not be enrolled in the gallery, as traditional biometric systems struggle to detect these non-mated probes. Despite the growing prevalence of multi-sample galleries in real-world deployments, most existing methods collapse intra-subject variability into a single global representation, leading to suboptimal decision boundaries and poor open-set robustness. To address this issue, we propose LocalScore, a simple yet effective scoring algorithm that explicitly incorporates the local density of the gallery feature distribution using the k-th nearest neighbors. LocalScore is architecture-agnostic, loss-independent, and incurs negligible computational overhead, making it a plug-and-play solution for existing biometric systems. Extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that LocalScore consistently achieves substantial gains in open-set retrieval (FNIR@FPIR reduced from 53% to 40%) and verification (TAR@FAR improved from 51% to 74%). We further provide theoretical analysis and empirical validation explaining when and why the method achieves the most significant gains based on dataset characteristics.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Automatically Curated Dataset in Thyroid Nodules Classification Algorithms Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagnosis of thyroid nodule cancers commonly utilizes ultrasound images. Several studies showed that deep learning algorithms designed to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules could match radiologists' performance. However, data availability for training deep learning models is often limited due to the significant effort required to curate such datasets. The previous study proposed a method to curate thyroid nodule datasets automatically. It was tested to have a 63% yield rate and 83% accuracy. However, the usefulness of the generated data for training deep learning models remains unknown. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine whether using a automatically-curated dataset improves deep learning algorithms' performance. We trained deep learning models on the manually annotated and automatically-curated datasets. We also trained with a smaller subset of the automatically-curated dataset that has higher accuracy to explore the optimum usage of such dataset. As a result, the deep learning model trained on the manually selected dataset has an AUC of 0.643 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.66). It is significantly lower than the AUC of the 6automatically-curated dataset trained deep learning model, 0.694 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 0.73, P &lt; .001). The AUC of the accurate subset trained deep learning model is 0.689 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.72, P &gt; .43), which is insignificantly worse than the AUC of the full automatically-curated dataset. In conclusion, we showed that using a automatically-curated dataset can substantially increase the performance of deep learning algorithms, and it is suggested to use all the data rather than only using the accurate subset.</description>

      <title>GMAC: Global Multi-View Constraint for Automatic Multi-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic calibration of multi-camera systems, namely the accurate estimation of spatial extrinsic parameters, is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, panoramic perception, and multi-view data fusion. Existing methods typically rely on calibration targets, explicit geometric modeling, or task-specific neural networks. Such approaches often exhibit limited robustness and applicability in complex dynamic environments or online scenarios, making them difficult to deploy in practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes GMAC, a multi-camera extrinsic estimation framework based on the implicit geometric representations learned by multi-view reconstruction networks. GMAC models extrinsics as global variables constrained by the latent multi-view geometric structure and prunes and structurally reconfigures existing networks so that their latent features can directly support extrinsic prediction through a lightweight regression head, without requiring a completely new network design. Furthermore, GMAC jointly optimizes cross-view reprojection consistency and multi-view cycle consistency, ensuring geometric coherence across cameras while improving prediction accuracy and optimization stability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-camera datasets demonstrate that GMAC achieves accurate and stable extrinsic estimation without explicit 3D reconstruction or manual calibration, providing a new solution for efficient deployment and online calibration of multi-camera systems.</description>

      <title>FUSE-Flow: Scalable Real-Time Multi-View Point Cloud Reconstruction Using Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view point cloud reconstruction is a core problem in 3D vision and immersive perception, with wide applications in VR, AR, robotic navigation, digital twins, and computer interaction. Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.</description>

      <title>VEQ: Modality-Adaptive Quantization for MoE Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer remarkable performance but incur prohibitive memory and computational costs, making compression essential. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>From Videos to Conversations: Egocentric Instructions for Task Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many everyday tasks, ranging from appliance repair and cooking to car maintenance, require expert knowledge, particularly for complex, multi-step procedures. Despite growing interest in AI agents for augmented reality (AR) assistance, progress remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale multimodal conversational datasets grounded in real-world task execution, in part due to the cost and logistical complexity of human-assisted data collection. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically transform single person instructional videos into two-person multimodal task-guidance conversations. Our fully automatic pipeline, based on large language models, provides a scalable and cost efficient alternative to traditional data collection approaches. Using this framework, we introduce HowToDIV, a multimodal dataset comprising 507 conversations, 6,636 question answer pairs, and 24 hours of video spanning multiple domains. Each session consists of a multi-turn expert-novice interaction. Finally, we report baseline results using Gemma 3 and Qwen 2.5 on HowToDIV, providing an initial benchmark for multimodal procedural task assistance.</description>

      <title>ReLayout: Versatile and Structure-Preserving Design Layout Editing via Relation-Aware Design Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated redesign without manual adjustments marks a key step forward in the design workflow. In this work, we focus on a foundational redesign task termed design layout editing, which seeks to autonomously modify the geometric composition of a design based on user intents. To overcome the ambiguity of user needs expressed in natural language, we introduce four basic and important editing actions and standardize the format of editing operations. The underexplored task presents a unique challenge: satisfying specified editing operations while simultaneously preserving the layout structure of unedited elements. Besides, the scarcity of triplet (original design, editing operation, edited design) samples poses another formidable challenge. To this end, we present ReLayout, a novel framework for versatile and structure-preserving design layout editing that operates without triplet data. Specifically, ReLayout first introduces the relation graph, which contains the position and size relationships among unedited elements, as the constraint for layout structure preservation. Then, relation-aware design reconstruction (RADR) is proposed to bypass the data challenge. By learning to reconstruct a design from its elements, a relation graph, and a synthesized editing operation, RADR effectively emulates the editing process in a self-supervised manner. A multi-modal large language model serves as the backbone for RADR, unifying multiple editing actions within a single model and thus achieving versatile editing after fine-tuning. Qualitative, quantitative results and user studies show that ReLayout significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of editing quality, accuracy, and layout structure preservation.</description>

      <title>Residual Decoding: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via History-Aware Residual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively from image-text inputs and perform well in various multimodal tasks. Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Baseline Method of the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging exhibits substantial heterogeneity across anatomical structures and acquisition protocols, posing significant challenges to the development of generalizable analysis models. Most existing methods are task-specific, limiting their suitability as clinically deployable foundation models. To address this limitation, the Foundation Model Challenge for Ultrasound Image Analysis (FM\_UIA~2026) introduces a large-scale multi-task benchmark comprising 27 subtasks across segmentation, classification, detection, and regression. In this paper, we present the official baseline for FM\_UIA~2026 based on a unified Multi-Head Multi-Task Learning (MH-MTL) framework that supports all tasks within a single shared network. The model employs an ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNet--B4 backbone for robust feature extraction, combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to capture multi-scale contextual information. A task-specific routing strategy enables global tasks to leverage high-level semantic features, while dense prediction tasks exploit spatially detailed FPN representations. Training incorporates a composite loss with task-adaptive learning rate scaling and a cosine annealing schedule. Validation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of this unified design, establishing a strong and extensible baseline for ultrasound foundation model research. The code and dataset are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/lijiake2408/Foundation-Model-Challenge-for-Ultrasound-Image-Analysis}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Radioactive 3D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged in computer vision as a promising rendering technique. By adapting the principles of Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA) splatting to a modern differentiable pipeline, 3DGS enables real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis. Building upon this, R2-Gaussian extended the 3DGS paradigm to tomographic reconstruction by rectifying integration bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computed tomography (CT). To enable differentiability, R2-Gaussian adopts a local affine approximation: each 3D Gaussian is locally mapped to a 2D Gaussian on the detector and composed via alpha blending to form projections. However, the affine approximation can degrade reconstruction quantitative accuracy and complicate the incorporation of nonlinear geometric corrections. To address these limitations, we propose a tomographic reconstruction framework based on 3D Gaussian ray tracing. Our approach provides two key advantages over splatting-based models: (i) it computes the line integral through 3D Gaussian primitives analytically, avoiding the local affine collapse and thus yielding a more physically consistent forward projection model; and (ii) the ray-tracing formulation gives explicit control over ray origins and directions, which facilitates the precise application of nonlinear geometric corrections, e.g., arc-correction used in positron emission tomography (PET). These properties extend the applicability of Gaussian-based reconstruction to a wider range of realistic tomography systems while improving projection accuracy.</description>

      <title>DRFormer: A Dual-Regularized Bidirectional Transformer for Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both fine-grained discriminative details and global semantic features can contribute to solving person re-identification challenges, such as occlusion and pose variations. Vision foundation models (\textit{e.g.}, DINO) excel at mining local textures, and vision-language models (\textit{e.g.}, CLIP) capture strong global semantic difference. Existing methods predominantly rely on a single paradigm, neglecting the potential benefits of their integration. In this paper, we analyze the complementary roles of these two architectures and propose a framework to synergize their strengths by a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{R}egularized Bidirectional \textbf{Transformer} (\textbf{DRFormer}). The dual-regularization mechanism ensures diverse feature extraction and achieves a better balance in the contributions of the two models. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our method effectively harmonizes local and global representations, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PDE-Constrained Optimization for Neural Image Segmentation with Physics Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of microscopy images constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem due to measurement noise, weak object boundaries, and limited labeled data. Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors. The proposed approach illustrates how PDE-constrained optimization can strengthen data-driven learning frameworks, providing a principled bridge between variational methods, statistical learning, and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>PISA: Piecewise Sparse Attention Is Wiser for Efficient Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers are fundamental for video and image generation, but their efficiency is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of attention. While block sparse attention accelerates computation by attending only critical key-value blocks, it suffers from degradation at high sparsity by discarding context. In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality.

      <title>MedAD-R1: Eliciting Consistent Reasoning in Interpretible Medical Anomaly Detection via Consistency-Reinforced Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Anomaly Detection (MedAD) presents a significant opportunity to enhance diagnostic accuracy using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to interpret and answer questions based on medical images. However, the reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on simplistic and fragmented datasets has hindered the development of models capable of plausible reasoning and robust multimodal generalization. To overcome this, we introduce MedAD-38K, the first large-scale, multi-modal, and multi-center benchmark for MedAD featuring diagnostic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations alongside structured Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs. On this foundation, we propose a two-stage training framework. The first stage, Cognitive Injection, uses SFT to instill foundational medical knowledge and align the model with a structured think-then-answer paradigm. Given that standard policy optimization can produce reasoning that is disconnected from the final answer, the second stage incorporates Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (Con-GRPO). This novel algorithm incorporates a crucial consistency reward to ensure the generated reasoning process is relevant and logically coherent with the final diagnosis. Our proposed model, MedAD-R1, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MedAD-38K benchmark, outperforming strong baselines by more than 10\%. This superior performance stems from its ability to generate transparent and logically consistent reasoning pathways, offering a promising approach to enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of AI for clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>Differential Vector Erasure: Unified Training-Free Concept Erasure for Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images, yet their tendency to reproduce undesirable concepts, such as NSFW content, copyrighted styles, or specific objects, poses growing concerns for safe and controllable deployment. While existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on DDPM-based diffusion models and rely on costly fine-tuning, the recent emergence of flow matching models introduces a fundamentally different generative paradigm for which prior methods are not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose Differential Vector Erasure (DVE), a training-free concept erasure method specifically designed for flow matching models. Our key insight is that semantic concepts are implicitly encoded in the directional structure of the velocity field governing the generative flow. Leveraging this observation, we construct a differential vector field that characterizes the directional discrepancy between a target concept and a carefully chosen anchor concept. During inference, DVE selectively removes concept-specific components by projecting the velocity field onto the differential direction, enabling precise concept suppression without affecting irrelevant semantics. Extensive experiments on FLUX demonstrate that DVE consistently outperforms existing baselines on a wide range of concept erasure tasks, including NSFW suppression, artistic style removal, and object erasure, while preserving image quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>PandaPose: 3D Human Pose Lifting from a Single Image via Propagating 2D Pose Prior to 3D Anchor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human pose lifting from a single RGB image is a challenging task in 3D vision. Existing methods typically establish a direct joint-to-joint mapping from 2D to 3D poses based on 2D features. This formulation suffers from two fundamental limitations: inevitable error propagation from input predicted 2D pose to 3D predictions and inherent difficulties in handling self-occlusion cases. In this paper, we propose PandaPose, a 3D human pose lifting approach via propagating 2D pose prior to 3D anchor space as the unified intermediate representation. Specifically, our 3D anchor space comprises: (1) Joint-wise 3D anchors in the canonical coordinate system, providing accurate and robust priors to mitigate 2D pose estimation inaccuracies. (2) Depth-aware joint-wise feature lifting that hierarchically integrates depth information to resolve self-occlusion ambiguities. (3) The anchor-feature interaction decoder that incorporates 3D anchors with lifted features to generate unified anchor queries encapsulating joint-wise 3D anchor set, visual cues and geometric depth information. The anchor queries are further employed to facilitate anchor-to-joint ensemble prediction. Experiments on three well-established benchmarks (i.e., Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW) demonstrate the superiority of our proposition. The substantial reduction in error by $14.7\%$ compared to SOTA methods on the challenging conditions of Human3.6M and qualitative comparisons further showcase the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Harmful Meme Detection under Missing Modalities via Shared Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet memes are powerful tools for communication, capable of spreading political, psychological, and sociocultural ideas. However, they can be harmful and can be used to disseminate hate toward targeted individuals or groups. Although previous studies have focused on designing new detection methods, these often rely on modal-complete data, such as text and images. In real-world settings, however, modalities like text may be missing due to issues like poor OCR quality, making existing methods sensitive to missing information and leading to performance deterioration. To address this gap, in this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to comprehensively investigate the behavior of harmful meme detection methods in the presence of modal-incomplete data. Specifically, we propose a new baseline method that learns a shared representation for multiple modalities by projecting them independently. These shared representations can then be leveraged when data is modal-incomplete. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches when text is missing. Moreover, these results suggest that our method allows for better integration of visual features, reducing dependence on text and improving robustness in scenarios where textual information is missing. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of harmful meme detection, particularly in situations where a modality is absent.</description>

      <title>LightCity: An Urban Dataset for Outdoor Inverse Rendering and Reconstruction under Multi-illumination Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse rendering in urban scenes is pivotal for applications like autonomous driving and digital twins. Yet, it faces significant challenges due to complex illumination conditions, including multi-illumination and indirect light and shadow effects. However, the effects of these challenges on intrinsic decomposition and 3D reconstruction have not been explored due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we present LightCity, a novel high-quality synthetic urban dataset featuring diverse illumination conditions with realistic indirect light and shadow effects. LightCity encompasses over 300 sky maps with highly controllable illumination, varying scales with street-level and aerial perspectives over 50K images, and rich properties such as depth, normal, material components, light and indirect light, etc. Besides, we leverage LightCity to benchmark three fundamental tasks in the urban environments and conduct a comprehensive analysis of these benchmarks, laying a robust foundation for advancing related research.</description>

      <title>Koo-Fu CLIP: Closed-Form Adaptation of Vision-Language Models via Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-language models such as CLIP provide powerful general-purpose representations, but their raw embeddings are not optimized for supervised classification, often exhibiting limited class separation and excessive dimensionality. We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations.
  Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</description>

      <title>Improving Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Models by Restoring Corrupted Visual Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generalist robotic manipulation, unifying perception and control within a single end-to-end architecture. However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $\pi_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\% success rates to as low as 2\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.</description>

      <title>Semantically Aware UAV Landing Site Assessment from Remote Sensing Imagery via Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe UAV emergency landing requires more than just identifying flat terrain; it demands understanding complex semantic risks (e.g., crowds, temporary structures) invisible to traditional geometric sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) imagery and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for global context-aware landing site assessment. Unlike local geometric methods, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine pipeline: first, a lightweight semantic segmentation module efficiently pre-screens candidate areas; second, a vision-language reasoning agent fuses visual features with Point-of-Interest (POI) data to detect subtle hazards. To validate this approach, we construct and release the Emergency Landing Site Selection (ELSS) benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms geometric baselines in risk identification accuracy. Furthermore, qualitative results confirm its ability to generate human-like, interpretable justifications, enhancing trust in automated decision-making. The benchmark dataset is publicly accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ELSS-dataset-43D7.</description>

      <title>EEmo-Logic: A Unified Dataset and Multi-Stage Framework for Comprehensive Image-Evoked Emotion Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the multi-dimensional attributes and intensity nuances of image-evoked emotions is pivotal for advancing machine empathy and empowering diverse human-computer interaction applications. However, existing models are still limited to coarse-grained emotion perception or deficient reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce EEmoDB, the largest image-evoked emotion understanding dataset to date. It features $5$ analysis dimensions spanning $5$ distinct task categories, facilitating comprehensive interpretation. Specifically, we compile $1.2M$ question-answering (QA) pairs (EEmoDB-QA) from $125k$ images via automated generation, alongside a $36k$ dataset (EEmoDB-Assess) curated from $25k$ images for fine-grained assessment. Furthermore, we propose EEmo-Logic, an all-in-one multimodal large language model (MLLM) developed via instruction fine-tuning and task-customized group relative preference optimization (GRPO) with novel reward design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EEmo-Logic achieves robust performance in in-domain and cross-domain datasets, excelling in emotion QA and fine-grained assessment. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EEmoLogic.</description>

      <title>Refining Context-Entangled Content Segmentation via Curriculum Selection and Anti-Curriculum Promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological learning proceeds from easy to difficult tasks, gradually reinforcing perception and robustness. Inspired by this principle, we address Context-Entangled Content Segmentation (CECS), a challenging setting where objects share intrinsic visual patterns with their surroundings, as in camouflaged object detection. Conventional segmentation networks predominantly rely on architectural enhancements but often ignore the learning dynamics that govern robustness under entangled data distributions. We introduce CurriSeg, a dual-phase learning framework that unifies curriculum and anti-curriculum principles to improve representation reliability. In the Curriculum Selection phase, CurriSeg dynamically selects training data based on the temporal statistics of sample losses, distinguishing hard-but-informative samples from noisy or ambiguous ones, thus enabling stable capability enhancement. In the Anti-Curriculum Promotion phase, we design Spectral-Blindness Fine-Tuning, which suppresses high-frequency components to enforce dependence on low-frequency structural and contextual cues and thus strengthens generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CurriSeg achieves consistent improvements across diverse CECS benchmarks without adding parameters or increasing total training time, offering a principled view of how progression and challenge interplay to foster robust and context-aware segmentation. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>EMFormer: Efficient Multi-Scale Transformer for Accumulative Context Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term weather forecasting is critical for socioeconomic planning and disaster preparedness. While recent approaches employ finetuning to extend prediction horizons, they remain constrained by the issues of catastrophic forgetting, error accumulation, and high training overhead. To address these limitations, we present a novel pipeline across pretraining, finetuning and forecasting to enhance long-context modeling while reducing computational overhead. First, we introduce an Efficient Multi-scale Transformer (EMFormer) to extract multi-scale features through a single convolution in both training and inference. Based on the new architecture, we further employ an accumulative context finetuning to improve temporal consistency without degrading short-term accuracy. Additionally, we propose a composite loss that dynamically balances different terms via a sinusoidal weighting, thereby adaptively guiding the optimization trajectory throughout pretraining and finetuning. Experiments show that our approach achieves strong performance in weather forecasting and extreme event prediction, substantially improving long-term forecast accuracy. Moreover, EMFormer demonstrates strong generalization on vision benchmarks (ImageNet-1K and ADE20K) while delivering a 5.69x speedup over conventional multi-scale modules.</description>

      <title>Med3D-R1: Incentivizing Clinical Reasoning in 3D Medical Vision-Language Models for Abnormality Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing 3D vision-language models with robust clinical reasoning remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of volumetric medical imaging, the tendency of models to overfit superficial report patterns, and the lack of interpretability-aware reward designs. In this paper, we propose Med3D-R1, a reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). During SFT stage, we introduce a residual alignment mechanism to bridge the gap between high-dimensional 3D features and textual embeddings, and an abnormality re-weighting strategy to emphasize clinically informative tokens and reduce structural bias in reports. In RL stage, we redesign the consistency reward to explicitly promote coherent, step-by-step diagnostic reasoning. We evaluate our method on medical multiple-choice visual question answering using two 3D diagnostic benchmarks, CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT, where our model attains state-of-the-art accuracies of 41.92\% on CT-RATE and 44.99\% on RAD-ChestCT. These results indicate improved abnormality diagnosis and clinical reasoning and outperform prior methods on both benchmarks. Overall, our approach holds promise for enhancing real-world diagnostic workflows by enabling more reliable and transparent 3D medical vision-language systems.</description>

      <title>Boosting Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization via Text Refinement and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, point-supervised temporal action localization has gained significant attention for its effective balance between labeling costs and localization accuracy. However, current methods only consider features from visual inputs, neglecting helpful semantic information from the text side. To address this issue, we propose a Text Refinement and Alignment (TRA) framework that effectively utilizes textual features from visual descriptions to complement the visual features as they are semantically rich. This is achieved by designing two new modules for the original point-supervised framework: a Point-based Text Refinement module (PTR) and a Point-based Multimodal Alignment module (PMA). Specifically, we first generate descriptions for video frames using a pre-trained multimodal model. Next, PTR refines the initial descriptions by leveraging point annotations together with multiple pre-trained models. PMA then projects all features into a unified semantic space and leverages a point-level multimodal feature contrastive learning to reduce the gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Last, the enhanced multi-modal features are fed into the action detector for precise localization. Extensive experimental results on five widely used benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our computational overhead analysis shows that the framework can run on a single 24 GB RTX 3090 GPU, indicating its practicality and scalability.</description>

      <title>OASIS-DC: Generalizable Depth Completion via Output-level Alignment of Sparse-Integrated Monocular Pseudo Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent monocular foundation models excel at zero-shot depth estimation, yet their outputs are inherently relative rather than metric, limiting direct use in robotics and autonomous driving. We leverage the fact that relative depth preserves global layout and boundaries: by calibrating it with sparse range measurements, we transform it into a pseudo metric depth prior. Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity.</description>

      <title>Q-DiT4SR: Exploration of Detail-Preserving Diffusion Transformer Quantization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged in Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) to generate high-quality textures, yet their heavy inference burden hinders real-world deployment. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\times$. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/xunzhang1128/Q-DiT4SR.</description>

      <title>TF-Lane: Traffic Flow Module for Robust Lane Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems require robust lane perception capabilities, yet existing vision-based detection methods suffer significant performance degradation when visual sensors provide insufficient cues, such as in occluded or lane-missing scenarios. While some approaches incorporate high-definition maps as supplementary information, these solutions face challenges of high subscription costs and limited real-time performance. To address these limitations, we explore an innovative information source: traffic flow, which offers real-time capabilities without additional costs. This paper proposes a TrafficFlow-aware Lane perception Module (TFM) that effectively extracts real-time traffic flow features and seamlessly integrates them with existing lane perception algorithms. This solution originated from real-world autonomous driving conditions and was subsequently validated on open-source algorithms and datasets. Extensive experiments on four mainstream models and two public datasets (Nuscenes and OpenLaneV2) using standard evaluation metrics show that TFM consistently improves performance, achieving up to +4.1% mAP gain on the Nuscenes dataset.</description>

      <title>DSFC-Net: A Dual-Encoder Spatial and Frequency Co-Awareness Network for Rural Road Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of rural roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for infrastructure planning and sustainable development. However, this task presents unique challenges in rural settings due to several factors. These include high intra-class variability and low inter-class separability from diverse surface materials, frequent vegetation occlusions that disrupt spatial continuity, and narrow road widths that exacerbate detection difficulties. Existing methods, primarily optimized for structured urban environments, often underperform in these scenarios as they overlook such distinctive characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose DSFC-Net, a dual-encoder framework that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency-domain information. Specifically, a CNN branch is employed to capture fine-grained local road boundaries and short-range continuity, while a novel Spatial-Frequency Hybrid Transformer (SFT) is introduced to robustly model global topological dependencies against vegetation occlusions. Distinct from standard attention mechanisms that suffer from frequency bias, the SFT incorporates a Cross-Frequency Interaction Attention (CFIA) module that explicitly decouples high- and low-frequency information via a Laplacian Pyramid strategy. This design enables the dynamic interaction between spatial details and frequency-aware global contexts, effectively preserving the connectivity of narrow roads. Furthermore, a Channel Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is proposed to bridge the two branches by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, seamlessly integrating local textures with global semantics for accurate segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the WHU-RuR+, DeepGlobe, and Massachusetts datasets validate the superiority of DSFC-Net over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Who Transfers Safety? Identifying and Targeting Cross-Lingual Shared Safety Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual safety remains significantly imbalanced, leaving non-high-resource (NHR) languages vulnerable compared to robust high-resource (HR) ones. Moreover, the neural mechanisms driving safety alignment remain unclear despite observed cross-lingual representation transfer.
  In this paper, we find that LLMs contain a set of cross-lingual shared safety neurons (SS-Neurons), a remarkably small yet critical neuronal subset that jointly regulates safety behavior across languages.
  We first identify monolingual safety neurons (MS-Neurons) and validate their causal role in safety refusal behavior through targeted activation and suppression.
  Our cross-lingual analyses then identify SS-Neurons as the subset of MS-Neurons shared between HR and NHR languages, serving as a bridge to transfer safety capabilities from HR to NHR domains.
  We observe that suppressing these neurons causes concurrent safety drops across NHR languages, whereas reinforcing them improves cross-lingual defensive consistency.
  Building on these insights, we propose a simple neuron-oriented training strategy that targets SS-Neurons based on language resource distribution and model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning this tiny neuronal subset outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing NHR safety while maintaining the model's general capabilities.
  The code and dataset will be available athttps://github.com/1518630367/SS-Neuron-Expansion.</description>

      <title>Interacted Planes Reveal 3D Line Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D line mapping from multi-view RGB images provides a compact and structured visual representation of scenes. We study the problem from a physical and topological perspective: a 3D line most naturally emerges as the edge of a finite 3D planar patch. We present LiP-Map, a line-plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives. This coupling enables accurate and detailed 3D line mapping while maintaining strong efficiency (typically completing a reconstruction in 3 to 5 minutes per scene). LiP-Map pioneers the integration of planar topology into 3D line mapping, not by imposing pairwise coplanarity constraints but by explicitly constructing interactions between plane and line primitives, thus offering a principled route toward structured reconstruction in man-made environments. On more than 100 scenes from ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, Hypersim, 7Scenes, and Tanks\&amp;Temple, LiP-Map improves both accuracy and completeness over state-of-the-art methods. Beyond line mapping quality, LiP-Map significantly advances line-assisted visual localization, establishing strong performance on 7Scenes. Our code is released at https://github.com/calmke/LiPMAP for reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Consistent Object Removal via MLLM-Based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based object removal often erases only the named target, leaving behind interaction evidence that renders the result semantically inconsistent. We formalize this problem as Interaction-Consistent Object Removal (ICOR), which requires removing not only the target object but also associated interaction elements, such as lighting-dependent effects, physically connected objects, targetproduced elements, and contextually linked objects. To address this task, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Object Removal with MLLM (REORM), a reasoningenhanced object removal framework that leverages multimodal large language models to infer which elements must be jointly removed. REORM features a modular design that integrates MLLM-driven analysis, mask-guided removal, and a self-correction mechanism, along with a local-deployment variant that supports accurate editing under limited resources. To support evaluation, we introduce ICOREval, a benchmark consisting of instruction-driven removals with rich interaction dependencies. On ICOREval, REORM outperforms state-of-the-art image editing systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing interactionconsistent results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating coherent visual stories requires maintaining subject identity across multiple images while preserving frame-specific semantics. Recent training-free methods concatenate identity and frame prompts into a unified representation, but this often introduces inter-frame semantic interference that weakens identity preservation in complex stories. We propose ReDiStory, a training-free framework that improves multi-frame story generation via inference-time prompt embedding reorganization. ReDiStory explicitly decomposes text embeddings into identity-related and frame-specific components, then decorrelates frame embeddings by suppressing shared directions across frames. This reduces cross-frame interference without modifying diffusion parameters or requiring additional supervision. Under identical diffusion backbones and inference settings, ReDiStory improves identity consistency while maintaining prompt fidelity. Experiments on the ConsiStory+ benchmark show consistent gains over 1Prompt1Story on multiple identity consistency metrics.

      <title>StoryState: Agent-Based State Control for Consistent and Editable Storybooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models have enabled one-click storybook generation, where users provide a short description and receive a multi-page illustrated story. However, the underlying story state, such as characters, world settings, and page-level objects, remains implicit, making edits coarse-grained and often breaking visual consistency. We present StoryState, an agent-based orchestration layer that introduces an explicit and editable story state on top of training-free text-to-image generation. StoryState represents each story as a structured object composed of a character sheet, global settings, and per-page scene constraints, and employs a small set of LLM agents to maintain this state and derive 1Prompt1Story-style prompts for generation and editing. Operating purely through prompts, StoryState is model-agnostic and compatible with diverse generation backends. System-level experiments on multi-page editing tasks show that StoryState enables localized page edits, improves cross-page consistency, and reduces unintended changes, interaction turns, and editing time compared to 1Prompt1Story, while approaching the one-shot consistency of Gemini Storybook.

      <title>DeCorStory: Gram-Schmidt Prompt Embedding Decorrelation for Consistent Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining visual and semantic consistency across frames is a key challenge in text-to-image storytelling. Existing training-free methods, such as One-Prompt-One-Story, concatenate all prompts into a single sequence, which often induces strong embedding correlation and leads to color leakage, background blending, and identity drift. We propose DeCorStory, a training-free inference-time framework that explicitly reduces inter-frame semantic interference. DeCorStory applies Gram-Schmidt prompt embedding decorrelation to orthogonalize frame-level semantics, followed by singular value reweighting to strengthen prompt-specific information and identity-preserving cross-attention to stabilize character identity during diffusion. The method requires no model modification or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion pipelines. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt-image alignment, identity consistency, and visual diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance among training-free baselines.

      <title>FlowCast: Trajectory Forecasting for Scalable Zero-Cost Speculative Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a powerful approach for high-quality visual generation. However, their prohibitively slow inference due to a large number of denoising steps limits their potential use in real-time or interactive applications. Existing acceleration methods, like distillation, truncation, or consistency training, either degrade quality, incur costly retraining, or lack generalization. We propose FlowCast, a training-free speculative generation framework that accelerates inference by exploiting the fact that FM models are trained to preserve constant velocity. FlowCast speculates future velocity by extrapolating current velocity without incurring additional time cost, and accepts it if it is within a mean-squared error threshold. This constant-velocity forecasting allows redundant steps in stable regions to be aggressively skipped while retaining precision in complex ones. FlowCast is a plug-and-play framework that integrates seamlessly with any FM model and requires no auxiliary networks. We also present a theoretical analysis and bound the worst-case deviation between speculative and full FM trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FlowCast achieves $&gt;2.5\times$ speedup in image generation, video generation, and editing tasks, outperforming existing baselines with no quality loss as compared to standard full generation.</description>

      <title>What Does Vision Tool-Use Reinforcement Learning Really Learn? Disentangling Tool-Induced and Intrinsic Effects for Crop-and-Zoom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision tool-use reinforcement learning (RL) can equip vision-language models with visual operators such as crop-and-zoom and achieves strong performance gains, yet it remains unclear whether these gains are driven by improvements in tool use or evolving intrinsic capabilities.We introduce MED (Measure-Explain-Diagnose), a coarse-to-fine framework that disentangles intrinsic capability changes from tool-induced effects, decomposes the tool-induced performance difference into gain and harm terms, and probes the mechanisms driving their evolution. Across checkpoint-level analyses on two VLMs with different tool priors and six benchmarks, we find that improvements are dominated by intrinsic learning, while tool-use RL mainly reduces tool-induced harm (e.g., fewer call-induced errors and weaker tool schema interference) and yields limited progress in tool-based correction of intrinsic failures. Overall, current vision tool-use RL learns to coexist safely with tools rather than master them.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Visual Metaphor Transfer via Schema-Driven Agentic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A visual metaphor constitutes a high-order form of human creativity, employing cross-domain semantic fusion to transform abstract concepts into impactful visual rhetoric. Despite the remarkable progress of generative AI, existing models remain largely confined to pixel-level instruction alignment and surface-level appearance preservation, failing to capture the underlying abstract logic necessary for genuine metaphorical generation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the task of Visual Metaphor Transfer (VMT), which challenges models to autonomously decouple the "creative essence" from a reference image and re-materialize that abstract logic onto a user-specified target subject. We propose a cognitive-inspired, multi-agent framework that operationalizes Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) through a novel Schema Grammar ("G"). This structured representation decouples relational invariants from specific visual entities, providing a rigorous foundation for cross-domain logic re-instantiation. Our pipeline executes VMT through a collaborative system of specialized agents: a perception agent that distills the reference into a schema, a transfer agent that maintains generic space invariance to discover apt carriers, a generation agent for high-fidelity synthesis and a hierarchical diagnostic agent that mimics a professional critic, performing closed-loop backtracking to identify and rectify errors across abstract logic, component selection, and prompt encoding. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines in metaphor consistency, analogy appropriateness, and visual creativity, paving the way for automated high-impact creative applications in advertising and media. Source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>MTC-VAE: Multi-Level Temporal Compression with Content Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) rely on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to compress videos into compact latent representations. For continuous Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), achieving higher compression rates is desirable; yet, the efficiency notably declines when extra sampling layers are added without expanding the dimensions of hidden channels. In this paper, we present a technique to convert fixed compression rate VAEs into models that support multi-level temporal compression, providing a straightforward and minimal fine-tuning approach to counteract performance decline at elevated compression rates.Moreover, we examine how varying compression levels impact model performance over video segments with diverse characteristics, offering empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also investigate the integration of our multi-level temporal compression VAE with diffusion-based generative models, DiT, highlighting successful concurrent training and compatibility within these frameworks. This investigation illustrates the potential uses of multi-level temporal compression.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Visual Autoregressive Acceleration via Dual-Linkage Entropy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) suffers from substantial computational cost due to the massive token count involved. Failing to account for the continuous evolution of modeling dynamics, existing VAR token reduction methods face three key limitations: heuristic stage partition, non-adaptive schedules, and limited acceleration scope, thereby leaving significant acceleration potential untapped. Since entropy variation intrinsically reflects the transition of predictive uncertainty, it offers a principled measure to capture modeling dynamics evolution. Therefore, we propose NOVA, a training-free token reduction acceleration framework for VAR models via entropy analysis. NOVA adaptively determines the acceleration activation scale during inference by online identifying the inflection point of scale entropy growth. Through scale-linkage and layer-linkage ratio adjustment, NOVA dynamically computes distinct token reduction ratios for each scale and layer, pruning low-entropy tokens while reusing the cache derived from the residuals at the prior scale to accelerate inference and maintain generation quality. Extensive experiments and analyses validate NOVA as a simple yet effective training-free acceleration framework.</description>

      <title>T2M Mamba: Motion Periodicity-Saliency Coupling Approach for Stable Text-Driven Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which converts motion language descriptions into coherent 3D human motion sequences, has attracted increasing attention in fields, such as avatar animation and humanoid robotic interaction. Though existing models have achieved significant fidelity, they still suffer from two core limitations: (i) They treat motion periodicity and keyframe saliency as independent factors, overlooking their coupling and causing generation drift in long sequences. (ii) They are fragile to semantically equivalent paraphrases, where minor synonym substitutions distort textual embeddings, propagating through the decoder and producing unstable or erroneous motions. In this work, we propose T2M Mamba to address these limitations by (i) proposing Periodicity-Saliency Aware Mamba, which utilizes novel algorithms for keyframe weight estimation via enhanced Density Peaks Clustering and motion periodicity estimation via FFT-accelerated autocorrelation to capture coupled dynamics with minimal computational overhead, and (ii) constructing a Periodic Differential Cross-modal Alignment Module (PDCAM) to enhance robust alignment of textual and motion embeddings. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets have been conducted, confirming the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an FID of 0.068 and consistent gains on all other metrics.</description>

      <title>Exposing and Defending the Achilles' Heel of Video Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated strong performance in video understanding tasks, yet its adversarial robustness remains underexplored. Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse datasets and architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE.</description>

      <title>PolyGen: Fully Synthetic Vision-Language Training via Multi-Generator Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data offers a scalable solution for vision-language pre-training, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on scaling up a single generative backbone, which introduces generator-specific spectral biases and limits feature diversity. In this work, we introduce PolyGen, a framework that redefines synthetic data construction by prioritizing manifold coverage and compositional rigor over simple dataset size. PolyGen employs a Polylithic approach to train on the intersection of architecturally distinct generators, effectively marginalizing out model-specific artifacts. Additionally, we introduce a Programmatic Hard Negative curriculum that enforces fine-grained syntactic understanding. By structurally reallocating the same data budget from unique captions to multi-source variations, PolyGen achieves a more robust feature space, outperforming the leading single-source baseline (SynthCLIP) by +19.0% on aggregate multi-task benchmarks and on the SugarCrepe++ compositionality benchmark (+9.1%). These results demonstrate that structural diversity is a more data-efficient scaling law than simply increasing the volume of single-source samples.</description>

      <title>PromptRL: Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching models (FMs) have revolutionized text-to-image (T2I) generation, with reinforcement learning (RL) serving as a critical post-training strategy for alignment with reward objectives. In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore.
  Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2$\times$ fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.

      <title>Stronger Semantic Encoders Can Harm Relighting Performance: Probing Visual Priors via Augmented Latent Intrinsics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-image relighting requires representations that disentangle scene properties from illumination. Recent methods rely on latent intrinsic representations but remain under-constrained and often fail on challenging materials such as metal and glass. A natural hypothesis is that stronger pretrained visual priors should resolve these failures. We find the opposite: features from top-performing semantic encoders often degrade relighting quality, revealing a fundamental trade-off between semantic abstraction and photometric fidelity. We study this trade-off and introduce Augmented Latent Intrinsics (ALI), which balances semantic context and dense photometric structure by fusing features from a pixel-aligned visual encoder into a latent-intrinsic framework, together with a self-supervised refinement strategy to mitigate the scarcity of paired real-world data. Trained only on unlabeled real-world image pairs and paired with a dense, pixel-aligned visual prior, ALI achieves strong improvements in relighting, with the largest gains on complex, specular materials.

      <title>Where to Attend: A Principled Vision-Centric Position Encoding with Parabolas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Parabolic Position Encoding (PaPE), a parabola-based position encoding for vision modalities in attention-based architectures. Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

      <title>BioTamperNet: Affinity-Guided State-Space Model Detecting Tampered Biomedical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose BioTamperNet, a novel framework for detecting duplicated regions in tampered biomedical images, leveraging affinity-guided attention inspired by State Space Model (SSM) approximations. Existing forensic models, primarily trained on natural images, often underperform on biomedical data where subtle manipulations can compromise experimental validity. To address this, BioTamperNet introduces an affinity-guided self-attention module to capture intra-image similarities and an affinity-guided cross-attention module to model cross-image correspondences. Our design integrates lightweight SSM-inspired linear attention mechanisms to enable efficient, fine-grained localization. Trained end-to-end, BioTamperNet simultaneously identifies tampered regions and their source counterparts. Extensive experiments on the benchmark bio-forensic datasets demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines in accurately detecting duplicated regions.

      <title>Cross-Paradigm Evaluation of Gaze-Based Semantic Object Identification for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding where drivers direct their visual attention during driving, as characterized by gaze behavior, is critical for developing next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems and improving road safety. This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a "part-versus-whole" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding vision transformer robustness through the lens of out-of-distribution detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision transformers have shown remarkable performance in vision tasks, but enabling them for accessible and real-time use is still challenging. Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta. Overall, our results suggest pretraining on large scale datasets may hinder low-bit quantization robustness in OOD detection and that data augmentation may be a more beneficial option.</description>

      <title>Preserving Localized Patch Semantics in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logit Lens has been proposed for visualizing tokens that contribute most to LLM answers. Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word "cat"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.</description>

      <title>Rotation-free Online Handwritten Character Recognition Using Linear Recurrent Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online handwritten character recognition leverages stroke order and dynamic features, which generally provide higher accuracy and robustness compared with offline recognition. However, in practical applications, rotational deformations can disrupt the spatial layout of strokes, substantially reducing recognition accuracy. Extracting rotation-invariant features therefore remains a challenging open problem. In this work, we employ the Sliding Window Path Signature (SW-PS) to capture local structural features of characters, and introduce the lightweight Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) as the classifier. The LRU combine the fast incremental processing capability of recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the efficient parallel training of state space models (SSM), while reliably modelling dynamic stroke characteristics. We conducted recognition experiments with random rotation angle up to $\pm 180^{\circ}$ on three subsets of the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset: digits, English upper letters, and Chinese radicals. The accuracies achieved after ensemble learning were $99.62\%$, $96.67\%$, and $94.33\%$, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SW-PS+LRU framework consistently surpasses competing models in both convergence speed and test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Making Avatars Interact: Towards Text-Driven Human-Object Interaction for Controllable Talking Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating talking avatars is a fundamental task in video generation. Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

      <title>FSCA-Net: Feature-Separated Cross-Attention Network for Robust Multi-Dataset Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd counting plays a vital role in public safety, traffic regulation, and smart city management. However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations. Extensive experiments on multiple crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that FSCA-Net effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-world crowd analysis.</description>

      <title>Toward Cognitive Supersensing in Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.</description>

      <title>Combined Flicker-banding and Moire Removal for Screen-Captured Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing display screens with mobile devices has become increasingly common, yet the resulting images often suffer from severe degradations caused by the coexistence of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, leading to significant visual quality degradation. Due to the strong coupling of these two artifacts in real imaging processes, existing methods designed for single degradations fail to generalize to such compound scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on joint removal of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding in screen-captured images, and propose a unified restoration framework, named CLEAR. To support this task, we construct a large-scale dataset containing both moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, and introduce an ISP-based flicker simulation pipeline to stabilize model training and expand the degradation distribution. Furthermore, we design a frequency-domain decomposition and re-composition module together with a trajectory alignment loss to enhance the modeling of compound artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently. outperforms existing image restoration approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal UNcommonsense: From Odd to Ordinary and Ordinary to Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commonsense reasoning in multimodal contexts remains a foundational challenge in artificial intelligence. We introduce Multimodal UNcommonsense(MUN), a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to handle scenarios that deviate from typical visual or contextual expectations. MUN pairs visual scenes with surprising or unlikely outcomes described in natural language, prompting models to either rationalize seemingly odd images using everyday logic or uncover unexpected interpretations in ordinary scenes. To support this task, we propose a retrieval-based in-context learning (R-ICL) framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from larger models to smaller ones without additional training. Leveraging a novel Multimodal Ensemble Retriever (MER), our method identifies semantically relevant exemplars even when image and text pairs are deliberately discordant. Experiments show an average improvement of 8.3% over baseline ICL methods, highlighting the effectiveness of R-ICL in low-frequency, atypical settings. MUN opens new directions for evaluating and improving visual-language models' robustness and adaptability in real-world, culturally diverse, and non-prototypical scenarios.</description>

      <title>One-Step Diffusion for Perceptual Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression methods have achieved notable progress, delivering high perceptual quality at low bitrates. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant inference latency and heavy computational overhead, primarily due to the large number of denoising steps required during decoding. To address this problem, we propose a diffusion-based image compression method that requires only a single-step diffusion process, significantly improving inference speed. To enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructed images, we introduce a discriminator that operates on compact feature representations instead of raw pixels, leveraging the fact that features better capture high-level texture and structural details. Experimental results show that our method delivers comparable compression performance while offering a 46$\times$ faster inference speed compared to recent diffusion-based approaches.

      <title>SGHA-Attack: Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment for Transferable Targeted Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are vulnerable to transfer-based adversarial perturbations, enabling attackers to optimize on surrogate models and manipulate black-box VLM outputs. Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses.</description>

      <title>HandMCM: Multi-modal Point Cloud-based Correspondence State Space Model for 3D Hand Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation that involves accurate estimation of 3D human hand keypoint locations is crucial for many human-computer interaction applications such as augmented reality. However, this task poses significant challenges due to self-occlusion of the hands and occlusions caused by interactions with objects. In this paper, we propose HandMCM to address these challenges. Our HandMCM is a novel method based on the powerful state space model (Mamba). By incorporating modules for local information injection/filtering and correspondence modeling, the proposed correspondence Mamba effectively learns the highly dynamic kinematic topology of keypoints across various occlusion scenarios. Moreover, by integrating multi-modal image features, we enhance the robustness and representational capacity of the input, leading to more accurate hand pose estimation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving severe occlusions. These results highlight the potential of our approach to advance the accuracy and reliability of 3D hand pose estimation in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Know Your Step: Faster and Better Alignment for Flow Matching Models via Step-aware Advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in flow matching models, particularly with reinforcement learning (RL), have significantly enhanced human preference alignment in few step text to image generators. However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences. The code and models of this work will be available to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Samba+: General and Accurate Salient Object Detection via A More Unified Mamba-based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing salient object detection (SOD) models are generally constrained by the limited receptive fields of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and quadratic computational complexity of Transformers. Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the "task-specific" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework.</description>

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need to understand human driver behavior while perceiving their navigation context, but jointly learning these heterogeneous tasks would cause inter-task negative transfer and impair system performance. Here, we propose a Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning (UV-M3TL) framework to simultaneously recognize driver behavior, driver emotion, vehicle behavior, and traffic context, while mitigating inter-task negative transfer. Our framework incorporates two core components: dual-branch spatial channel multimodal embedding (DB-SCME) and adaptive feature-decoupled multi-task loss (AFD-Loss). DB-SCME enhances cross-task knowledge transfer while mitigating task conflicts by employing a dual-branch structure to explicitly model salient task-shared and task-specific features. AFD-Loss improves the stability of joint optimization while guiding the model to learn diverse multi-task representations by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism based on learning dynamics and feature decoupling constraints. We evaluate our method on the AIDE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that UV-M3TL achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four tasks. To further prove the versatility, we evaluate UV-M3TL on additional public multi-task perception benchmarks (BDD100K, CityScapes, NYUD-v2, and PASCAL-Context), where it consistently delivers strong performance across diverse task combinations, attaining state-of-the-art results on most tasks.</description>

      <title>Token Pruning for In-Context Generation in Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context generation significantly enhances Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by enabling controllable image-to-image generation through reference examples. However, the resulting input concatenation drastically increases sequence length, creating a substantial computational bottleneck. Existing token reduction techniques, primarily tailored for text-to-image synthesis, fall short in this paradigm as they apply uniform reduction strategies, overlooking the inherent role asymmetry between reference contexts and target latents across spatial, temporal, and functional dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToPi, a training-free token pruning framework tailored for in-context generation in DiTs. Specifically, ToPi utilizes offline calibration-driven sensitivity analysis to identify pivotal attention layers, serving as a robust proxy for redundancy estimation. Leveraging these layers, we derive a novel influence metric to quantify the contribution of each context token for selective pruning, coupled with a temporal update strategy that adapts to the evolving diffusion trajectory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ToPi can achieve over 30\% speedup in inference while maintaining structural fidelity and visual consistency across complex image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</description>

      <title>PISCES: Annotation-free Text-to-Video Post-Training via Optimal Transport-Aligned Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation aims to synthesize videos with high visual quality and temporal consistency that are semantically aligned with input text. Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Research on World Models Is Not Merely Injecting World Knowledge into Specific Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models have emerged as a critical frontier in AI research, aiming to enhance large models by infusing them with physical dynamics and world knowledge. The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.</description>

      <title>Federated Vision Transformer with Adaptive Focal Loss for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models like Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved significant advances, they typically require large datasets. With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\% to 41.69\%. Ablation studies on the imbalanced ISIC dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and aggregation strategy compared to traditional loss functions and other FL approaches.

      <title>ReCALL: Recalibrating Capability Degradation for MLLM-based Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images based on a hybrid query comprising a reference image and a modification text. Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Contribution-aware Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the redundancy of video tokens introduces significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment. Many compression algorithms are proposed to prioritize retaining features with the highest attention scores to minimize perturbations in attention computations. However, the correlation between attention scores and their actual contribution to correct answers remains ambiguous. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontribution-\textbf{a}ware token \textbf{Co}mpression algorithm for \textbf{VID}eo understanding (\textbf{CaCoVID}) that explicitly optimizes the token selection policy based on the contribution of tokens to correct predictions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes a policy network to select video token combinations with the greatest contribution to correct predictions. This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID. Codes will be released.</description>

      <title>From Frames to Sequences: Temporally Consistent Human-Centric Dense Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the challenge of temporally consistent human-centric dense prediction across video sequences. Existing models achieve strong per-frame accuracy but often flicker under motion, occlusion, and lighting changes, and they rarely have paired human video supervision for multiple dense tasks. We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.1 and Hi4D and generalize effectively to in-the-wild videos.</description>

      <title>Moonworks Lunara Aesthetic II: An Image Variation Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Lunara Aesthetic II, a publicly released, ethically sourced image dataset designed to support controlled evaluation and learning of contextual consistency in modern image generation and editing systems. The dataset comprises 2,854 anchor-linked variation pairs derived from original art and photographs created by Moonworks. Each variation pair applies contextual transformations, such as illumination, weather, viewpoint, scene composition, color tone, or mood; while preserving a stable underlying identity. Lunara Aesthetic II operationalizes identity-preserving contextual variation as a supervision signal while also retaining Lunara's signature high aesthetic scores. Results show high identity stability, strong target attribute realization, and a robust aesthetic profile that exceeds large-scale web datasets. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, Lunara Aesthetic II is intended for benchmarking, fine-tuning, and analysis of contextual generalization, identity preservation, and edit robustness in image generation and image-to-image systems with interpretable, relational supervision. The dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/moonworks/lunara-aesthetic-image-variations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Loop Closure Detection in Visual SLAM via NetVLAD and Faiss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop closure detection (LCD) is a core component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): it identifies revisited places and enables pose-graph constraints that correct accumulated drift. Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM.</description>

      <title>VRGaussianAvatar: Integrating 3D Gaussian Avatars into VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VRGaussianAvatar, an integrated system that enables real-time full-body 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) avatars in virtual reality using only head-mounted display (HMD) tracking signals. The system adopts a parallel pipeline with a VR Frontend and a GA Backend. The VR Frontend uses inverse kinematics to estimate full-body pose and streams the resulting pose along with stereo camera parameters to the backend. The GA Backend stereoscopically renders a 3DGS avatar reconstructed from a single image. To improve stereo rendering efficiency, we introduce Binocular Batching, which jointly processes left and right eye views in a single batched pass to reduce redundant computation and support high-resolution VR displays. We evaluate VRGaussianAvatar with quantitative performance tests and a within-subject user study against image- and video-based mesh avatar baselines. Results show that VRGaussianAvatar sustains interactive VR performance and yields higher perceived appearance similarity, embodiment, and plausibility.

      <title>SMTrack: State-Aware Mamba for Efficient Temporal Modeling in Visual Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual tracking aims to automatically estimate the state of a target object in a video sequence, which is challenging especially in dynamic scenarios. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs.</description>

      <title>FreshMem: Brain-Inspired Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory for Streaming Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) from offline to online streaming video understanding is essential for continuous perception. However, existing methods lack flexible adaptivity, leading to irreversible detail loss and context fragmentation. To resolve this, we propose FreshMem, a Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory network inspired by the brain's logarithmic perception and memory consolidation. FreshMem reconciles short-term fidelity with long-term coherence through two synergistic modules: Multi-scale Frequency Memory (MFM), which projects overflowing frames into representative frequency coefficients, complemented by residual details to reconstruct a global historical "gist"; and Space Thumbnail Memory (STM), which discretizes the continuous stream into episodic clusters by employing an adaptive compression strategy to distill them into high-density space thumbnails. Extensive experiments show that FreshMem significantly boosts the Qwen2-VL baseline, yielding gains of 5.20%, 4.52%, and 2.34% on StreamingBench, OV-Bench, and OVO-Bench, respectively. As a training-free solution, FreshMem outperforms several fully fine-tuned methods, offering a highly efficient paradigm for long-horizon streaming video understanding.</description>

Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</description>

      <title>FastPhysGS: Accelerating Physics-based Dynamic 3DGS Simulation via Interior Completion and Adaptive Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to 4D physical simulation remains challenging. Based on the Material Point Method (MPM), existing methods either rely on manual parameter tuning or distill dynamics from video diffusion models, limiting the generalization and optimization efficiency. Recent attempts using LLMs/VLMs suffer from a text/image-to-3D perceptual gap, yielding unstable physics behavior. In addition, they often ignore the surface structure of 3DGS, leading to implausible motion. We propose FastPhysGS, a fast and robust framework for physics-based dynamic 3DGS simulation:(1) Instance-aware Particle Filling (IPF) with Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS) to efficiently populate interior particles while preserving geometric fidelity; (2) Bidirectional Graph Decoupling Optimization (BGDO), an adaptive strategy that rapidly optimizes material parameters predicted from a VLM. Experiments show FastPhysGS achieves high-fidelity physical simulation in 1 minute using only 7 GB runtime memory, outperforming prior works with broad potential applications.</description>

      <title>DenVisCoM: Dense Vision Correspondence Mamba for Efficient and Real-time Optical Flow and Stereo Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel Mamba block DenVisCoM, as well as a novel hybrid architecture specifically tailored for accurate and real-time estimation of optical flow and disparity estimation. Given that such multi-view geometry and motion tasks are fundamentally related, we propose a unified architecture to tackle them jointly. Specifically, the proposed hybrid architecture is based on DenVisCoM and a Transformer-based attention block that efficiently addresses real-time inference, memory footprint, and accuracy at the same time for joint estimation of motion and 3D dense perception tasks. We extensively analyze the benchmark trade-off of accuracy and real-time processing on a large number of datasets. Our experimental results and related analysis suggest that our proposed model can accurately estimate optical flow and disparity estimation in real time.

      <title>Simplicity Prevails: The Emergence of Generalizable AIGI Detection in Visual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-Generated Images (AIGI) achieve near-perfect accuracy on curated benchmarks, they suffer from a dramatic performance collapse in realistic, in-the-wild scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability.</description>

      <title>Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization for 3D Geometry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning complexity and scale of 3D geometry models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference without retraining, conventional methods, primarily optimized for 2D Vision Transformers, fail to transfer effectively to 3D models due to intricate feature distributions and prohibitive calibration overhead. To address these challenges, we propose TAPTQ, a Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization pipeline specifically engineered for 3D geometric learning. Our contribution is threefold: (1) To overcome the data-scale bottleneck in 3D datasets, we develop a progressive coarse-to-fine calibration construction strategy that constructs a highly compact subset to achieve both statistical purity and geometric representativeness. (2) We reformulate the quantization interval search as an optimization problem and introduce a ternary-search-based solver, reducing the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ for accelerated deployment. (3) To mitigate quantization error accumulation, we propose TRE-Guided Module-wise Compensation, which utilizes a Tail Relative Error (TRE) metric to adaptively identify and rectify distortions in modules sensitive to long-tailed activation outliers. Extensive experiments on the VGGT and Pi3 benchmarks demonstrate that TAPTQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods in accuracy while significantly reducing calibration time. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>ObjEmbed: Towards Universal Multimodal Object Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning objects with corresponding textual descriptions is a fundamental challenge and a realistic requirement in vision-language understanding. While recent multimodal embedding models excel at global image-text alignment, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment between image regions and specific phrases. In this work, we present ObjEmbed, a novel MLLM embedding model that decomposes the input image into multiple regional embeddings, each corresponding to an individual object, along with global embeddings. It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination.</description>

      <title>Spot-Wise Smart Parking: An Edge-Enabled Architecture with YOLOv11 and Digital Twin Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart parking systems help reduce congestion and minimize users' search time, thereby contributing to smart city adoption and enhancing urban mobility. In previous works, we presented a system developed on a university campus to monitor parking availability by estimating the number of free spaces from vehicle counts within a region of interest. Although this approach achieved good accuracy, it restricted the system's ability to provide spot-level insights and support more advanced applications. To overcome this limitation, we extend the system with a spot-wise monitoring strategy based on a distance-aware matching method with spatial tolerance, enhanced through an Adaptive Bounding Box Partitioning method for challenging spaces. The proposed approach achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.80% while maintaining an inference time of 8 seconds on a resource-constrained edge device, enhancing the capabilities of YOLOv11m, a model that has a size of 40.5 MB. In addition, two new components were introduced: (i) a Digital Shadow that visually represents parking lot entities as a base to evolve to a full Digital Twin, and (ii) an application support server based on a repurposed TV box. The latter not only enables scalable communication among cloud services, the parking totem, and a bot that provides detailed spot occupancy statistics, but also promotes hardware reuse as a step towards greater sustainability.</description>

      <title>Mind-Brush: Integrating Agentic Cognitive Search and Reasoning into Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While text-to-image generation has achieved unprecedented fidelity, the vast majority of existing models function fundamentally as static text-to-pixel decoders. Consequently, they often fail to grasp implicit user intentions. Although emerging unified understanding-generation models have improved intent comprehension, they still struggle to accomplish tasks involving complex knowledge reasoning within a single model. Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, a unified agentic framework that transforms generation into a dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Simulating a human-like 'think-research-create' paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-of-distribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing a zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE.</description>

      <title>MagicFuse: Single Image Fusion for Visual and Semantic Reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a highly practical scenario: how to continue benefiting from the advantages of multi-modal image fusion under harsh conditions when only visible imaging sensors are available. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel concept of single-image fusion, which extends conventional data-level fusion to the knowledge level. Specifically, we develop MagicFuse, a novel single image fusion framework capable of deriving a comprehensive cross-spectral scene representation from a single low-quality visible image. MagicFuse first introduces an intra-spectral knowledge reinforcement branch and a cross-spectral knowledge generation branch based on the diffusion models. They mine scene information obscured in the visible spectrum and learn thermal radiation distribution patterns transferred to the infrared spectrum, respectively. Building on them, we design a multi-domain knowledge fusion branch that integrates the probabilistic noise from the diffusion streams of these two branches, from which a cross-spectral scene representation can be obtained through successive sampling. Then, we impose both visual and semantic constraints to ensure that this scene representation can satisfy human observation while supporting downstream semantic decision-making. Extensive experiments show that our MagicFuse achieves visual and semantic representation performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art fusion methods with multi-modal inputs, despite relying solely on a single degraded visible image.</description>

      <title>GDPR-Compliant Person Recognition in Industrial Environments Using MEMS-LiDAR and Hybrid Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable detection of unauthorized individuals in safety-critical industrial indoor spaces is crucial to avoid plant shutdowns, property damage, and personal hazards. Conventional vision-based methods that use deep-learning approaches for person recognition provide image information but are sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions and often violate privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Typically, detection systems based on deep learning require annotated data for training. Collecting and annotating such data, however, is highly time-consuming and due to manual treatments not necessarily error free. Therefore, this paper presents a privacy-compliant approach based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems LiDAR (MEMS-LiDAR), which exclusively captures anonymized 3D point clouds and avoids personal identification features. To compensate for the large amount of time required to record real LiDAR data and for post-processing and annotation, real recordings are augmented with synthetically generated scenes from the CARLA simulation framework. The results demonstrate that the hybrid data improves the average precision by 44 percentage points compared to a model trained exclusively with real data while reducing the manual annotation effort by 50 %. Thus, the proposed approach provides a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to purely real-data-based methods and systematically shows how synthetic LiDAR data can combine high performance in person detection with GDPR compliance in an industrial environment.</description>

      <title>DDP-WM: Disentangled Dynamics Prediction for Efficient World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models are essential for autonomous robotic planning. However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models. Codes will be available at https://github.com/HCPLabSYSU/DDP-WM.</description>

      <title>Automated Discontinuity Set Characterisation in Enclosed Rock Face Point Clouds Using Single-Shot Filtering and Cyclic Orientation Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterisation of structural discontinuity sets in exposed rock faces of underground mine cavities is essential for assessing rock-mass stability, excavation safety, and operational efficiency. UAV and other mobile laser-scanning techniques provide efficient means of collecting point clouds from rock faces. However, the development of a robust and efficient approach for automatic characterisation of discontinuity sets in real-world scenarios, like fully enclosed rock faces in cavities, remains an open research problem. In this study, a new approach is proposed for automatic discontinuity set characterisation that uses a single-shot filtering strategy, an innovative cyclic orientation transformation scheme and a hierarchical clustering technique. The single-shot filtering step isolates planar regions while robustly suppressing noise and high-curvature artefacts in one pass using a signal-processing technique. To address the limitations of Cartesian clustering on polar orientation data, a cyclic orientation transformation scheme is developed, enabling accurate representation of dip angle and dip direction in Cartesian space. The transformed orientations are then characterised into sets using a hierarchical clustering technique, which handles varying density distributions and identifies clusters without requiring user-defined set numbers. The accuracy of the method is validated on real-world mine stope and against ground truth obtained using manually handpicked discontinuity planes identified with the Virtual Compass tool, as well as widely used automated structure mapping techniques. The proposed approach outperforms the other techniques by exhibiting the lowest mean absolute error in estimating discontinuity set orientations in real-world stope data with errors of 1.95{\deg} and 2.20{\deg} in nominal dip angle and dip direction, respectively, and dispersion errors lying below 3{\deg}.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Transformers for Long-Term NDVI Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term satellite image time series (SITS) analysis in heterogeneous landscapes faces significant challenges, particularly in Mediterranean regions where complex spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and multi-decade environmental changes interact across different scales. This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.</description>

      <title>Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion and World Models with Temporal Cache Compression and Sparse Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.</description>

      <title>FlowBypass: Rectified Flow Trajectory Bypass for Training-Free Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free image editing has attracted increasing attention for its efficiency and independence from training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on inversion-reconstruction trajectories, which impose an inherent trade-off: longer trajectories accumulate errors and compromise fidelity, while shorter ones fail to ensure sufficient alignment with the edit prompt. Previous attempts to address this issue typically employ backbone-specific feature manipulations, limiting general applicability. To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions.</description>

      <title>LDRNet: Large Deformation Registration Model for Chest CT Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the deep learning based medical image registration algorithms focus on brain image registration tasks.Compared with brain registration, the chest CT registration has larger deformation, more complex background and region over-lap. In this paper, we propose a fast unsupervised deep learning method, LDRNet, for large deformation image registration of chest CT images. We first predict a coarse resolution registration field, then refine it from coarse to fine. We propose two innovative technical components: 1) a refine block that is used to refine the registration field in different resolutions, 2) a rigid block that is used to learn transformation matrix from high-level features. We train and evaluate our model on the private dataset and public dataset SegTHOR. We compare our performance with state-of-the-art traditional registration methods as well as deep learning registration models VoxelMorph, RCN, and LapIRN. The results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for large deformation images registration and is much faster.</description>

      <title>GPD: Guided Progressive Distillation for Fast and High-Quality Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in video generation; however, the high computational cost of the denoising process remains a major bottleneck. Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.</description>

      <title>Seeing Is Believing? A Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models on Visual Illusions and Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency on general-purpose vision-language benchmarks, reaching or even exceeding human-level performance. However, these evaluations typically rely on standard in-distribution data, leaving the robustness of MLLMs largely unexamined when faced with scenarios that defy common-sense priors. To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli. Our findings reveal a fundamental divergence between machine and human perception, suggesting that resolving such perceptual bottlenecks is critical for the advancement of artificial general intelligence. The benchmark data and code will be released.</description>

      <title>Efficient Cross-Country Data Acquisition Strategy for ADAS via Street-View Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying ADAS and ADS across countries remains challenging due to differences in legislation, traffic infrastructure, and visual conventions, which introduce domain shifts that degrade perception performance. Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible. These results highlight the potential of street-view-guided data acquisition for efficient and cost-effective cross-country model adaptation.</description>

      <title>SPIRIT: Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Unified Single- and Multi-Frame Infrared Small Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is crucial for surveillance and early-warning, with deployments spanning both single-frame analysis and video-mode tracking. A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent. Experiments on multiple IRSTD benchmarks show consistent gains over VFM-based baselines and SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>CloDS: Visual-Only Unsupervised Cloth Dynamics Learning in Unknown Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in simulating complex dynamic systems. However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations. Our code is available at https://github.com/whynot-zyl/CloDS. Visualization results are available at https://github.com/whynot-zyl/CloDS_video}.%\footnote{As in this example.</description>

      <title>WS-IMUBench: Can Weakly Supervised Methods from Audio, Image, and Video Be Adapted for IMU-based Temporal Action Localization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.</description>

      <title>How Well Do Models Follow Visual Instructions? VIBE: A Systematic Benchmark for Visual Instruction-Driven Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative models have achieved remarkable progress in image editing. However, existing systems and benchmarks remain largely text-guided. In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Fact or Fake? Assessing the Role of Deepfake Detectors in Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal misinformation, deception usually arises not just from pixel-level manipulations in an image, but from the semantic and contextual claim jointly expressed by the image-text pair. Yet most deepfake detectors, engineered to detect pixel-level forgeries, do not account for claim-level meaning, despite their growing integration in automated fact-checking (AFC) pipelines. This raises a central scientific and practical question: Do pixel-level detectors contribute useful signal for verifying image-text claims, or do they instead introduce misleading authenticity priors that undermine evidence-based reasoning? We provide the first systematic analysis of deepfake detectors in the context of multimodal misinformation detection. Using two complementary benchmarks, MMFakeBench and DGM4, we evaluate: (1) state-of-the-art image-only deepfake detectors, (2) an evidence-driven fact-checking system that performs tool-guided retrieval via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and engages in deliberative inference through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), and (3) a hybrid fact-checking system that injects detector outputs as auxiliary evidence. Results across both benchmark datasets show that deepfake detectors offer limited standalone value, achieving F1 scores in the range of 0.26-0.53 on MMFakeBench and 0.33-0.49 on DGM4, and that incorporating their predictions into fact-checking pipelines consistently reduces performance by 0.04-0.08 F1 due to non-causal authenticity assumptions. In contrast, the evidence-centric fact-checking system achieves the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of approximately 0.81 on MMFakeBench and 0.55 on DGM4. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multimodal claim verification is driven primarily by semantic understanding and external evidence, and that pixel-level artifact signals do not reliably enhance reasoning over real-world image-text misinformation.</description>

      <title>Trust but Verify: Adaptive Conditioning for Reference-Based Diffusion Super-Resolution via Implicit Reference Correlation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have explored reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) to mitigate hallucinations in diffusion-based image restoration. A key challenge is that real-world degradations make correspondences between low-quality (LQ) inputs and reference (Ref) images unreliable, requiring adaptive control of reference usage. Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a "Trust but Verify" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment.</description>

      <title>ProxyImg: Towards Highly-Controllable Image Representation via Hierarchical Disentangled Proxy Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing image representation methods, including explicit representations such as raster images and Gaussian primitives, as well as implicit representations such as latent images, either suffer from representation redundancy that leads to heavy manual editing effort, or lack a direct mapping from latent variables to semantic instances or parts, making fine-grained manipulation difficult. These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches.</description>

      <title>Q Cache: Visual Attention is Valuable in Less than Half of Decode Layers for Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparse Visual Representations via Spatial-Semantic Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) faces a fundamental conflict between semantic understanding and image reconstruction. High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

      <title>DSXFormer: Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion and Dynamic Context Attention Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a challenging task due to high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited labeled training samples. Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enabling Progressive Whole-slide Image Analysis with Multi-scale Pyramidal Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) is commonly used to undertake computational pathology (CPath) tasks, and the use of multi-scale patches allows diverse features across scales to be learned. Previous studies using multi-scale features in clinical applications rely on multiple inputs across magnifications with late feature fusion, which does not retain the link between features across scales while the inputs are dependent on arbitrary, manufacturer-defined magnifications, being inflexible and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose the Multi-scale Pyramidal Network (MSPN), which is plug-and-play over attention-based MIL that introduces progressive multi-scale analysis on WSI. Our MSPN consists of (1) grid-based remapping that uses high magnification features to derive coarse features and (2) the coarse guidance network (CGN) that learns coarse contexts. We benchmark MSPN as an add-on module to 4 attention-based frameworks using 4 clinically relevant tasks across 3 types of foundation model, as well as the pre-trained MIL framework. We show that MSPN consistently improves MIL across the compared configurations and tasks, while being lightweight and easy-to-use.</description>

      <title>Beyond Open Vocabulary: Multimodal Prompting for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing commonly relies on text-only prompting to specify target categories, implicitly assuming that inference-time category queries can be reliably grounded through pretraining-induced text-visual alignment. In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned.</description>

      <title>Your AI-Generated Image Detector Can Secretly Achieve SOTA Accuracy, If Calibrated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being trained on balanced datasets, existing AI-generated image detectors often exhibit systematic bias at test time, frequently misclassifying fake images as real. We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen. This parametric adjustment compensates for distributional shift in model output, realigning the decision boundary even without requiring ground-truth labels. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves robustness without retraining, offering a lightweight and principled solution for reliable and adaptive AI-generated image detection in the open world.

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Image Understanding through Delimiter Token Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Latent Vector Prediction for Localized Control in Image Generation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models emerged as a leading approach in text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.</description>

      <title>SurfSplat: Conquering Feedforward 2D Gaussian Splatting with Surface Continuity Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse images remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and texture without optimization. Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

      <title>UniDriveDreamer: A Single-Stage Multimodal World Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World models have demonstrated significant promise for data synthesis in autonomous driving. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniDriveDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both video and LiDAR generation, while also yielding measurable improvements in downstream</description>

      <title>ClueTracer: Question-to-Vision Clue Tracing for Training-Free Hallucination Suppression in Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models solve challenging visual problems via explicit long-chain inference: they gather visual clues from images and decode clues into textual tokens. Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\rightarrow$ outputs $\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \texttt{R1-OneVision}, \texttt{Ocean-R1}, \texttt{MM-Eureka}, \emph{etc}.) by $\mathbf{1.21\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks. When transferred to \textbf{non-reasoning} settings, it yields a $\mathbf{1.14\times}$ gain.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Genomic Modeling Through Optical Character Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent genomic foundation models largely adopt large language model architectures that treat DNA as a one-dimensional token sequence. However, exhaustive sequential reading is structurally misaligned with sparse and discontinuous genomic semantics, leading to wasted computation on low-information background and preventing understanding-driven compression for long contexts. Here, we present OpticalDNA, a vision-based framework that reframes genomic modeling as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-style document understanding. OpticalDNA renders DNA into structured visual layouts and trains an OCR-capable vision--language model with a \emph{visual DNA encoder} and a \emph{document decoder}, where the encoder produces compact, reconstructible visual tokens for high-fidelity compression. Building on this representation, OpticalDNA defines prompt-conditioned objectives over core genomic primitives-reading, region grounding, subsequence retrieval, and masked span completion-thereby learning layout-aware DNA representations that retain fine-grained genomic information under a reduced effective token budget. Across diverse genomic benchmarks, OpticalDNA consistently outperforms recent baselines; on sequences up to 450k bases, it achieves the best overall performance with nearly $20\times$ fewer effective tokens, and surpasses models with up to $985\times$ more activated parameters while tuning only 256k \emph{trainable} parameters.</description>

      <title>One Size, Many Fits: Aligning Diverse Group-Wise Click Preferences in Large-Scale Advertising Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advertising image generation has increasingly focused on online metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), yet existing approaches adopt a ``one-size-fits-all" strategy that optimizes for overall CTR while neglecting preference diversity among user groups. This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings. Our code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/JD-GenX/OSMF.</description>

      <title>Auto-Comp: An Automated Pipeline for Scalable Compositional Probing of Contrastive Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a critical flaw in compositional reasoning, often confusing "a red cube and a blue sphere" with "a blue cube and a red sphere". Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., "a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., "In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel "Confusion Benchmark" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter. We release the Auto-Comp pipeline to facilitate future benchmark creation, alongside all our generated benchmarks (https://huggingface.co/AutoComp).</description>

      <title>Multi-View Stenosis Classification Leveraging Transformer-Based Multiple-Instance Learning Using Real-World Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

      <title>UrbanGS: A Scalable and Efficient Architecture for Geometrically Accurate Large-Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality, real-time rendering for bounded scenes, its extension to large-scale urban environments gives rise to critical challenges in terms of geometric consistency, memory efficiency, and computational scalability. To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>FSVideo: Fast Speed Video Diffusion Model in a Highly-Compressed Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FSVideo, a fast speed transformer-based image-to-video (I2V) diffusion framework. We build our framework on the following key components: 1.) a new video autoencoder with highly-compressed latent space ($64\times64\times4$ spatial-temporal downsampling ratio), achieving competitive reconstruction quality; 2.) a diffusion transformer (DIT) architecture with a new layer memory design to enhance inter-layer information flow and context reuse within DIT, and 3.) a multi-resolution generation strategy via a few-step DIT upsampler to increase video fidelity. Our final model, which contains a 14B DIT base model and a 14B DIT upsampler, achieves competitive performance against other popular open-source models, while being an order of magnitude faster. We discuss our model design as well as training strategies in this report.</description>

      <title>Teacher-Guided Student Self-Knowledge Distillation Using Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods often align feature information between teacher and student by exploring meaningful feature processing and loss functions. However, due to the difference in feature distributions between the teacher and student, the student model may learn incompatible information from the teacher. To address this problem, we propose teacher-guided student Diffusion Self-KD, dubbed as DSKD. Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher. Experiments on visual recognition tasks demonstrate that DSKD significantly outperforms existing KD methods across various models and datasets. Our code is attached in supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-Based Quantitatively Controllable Image Generation via Matrix-Form EDM and Adaptive Vicinal Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) is a diffusion-based framework designed to generate high-quality images conditioned on continuous regression labels. Although CCDM has demonstrated clear advantages over prior approaches across a range of datasets, it still exhibits notable limitations and has recently been surpassed by a GAN-based method, namely CcGAN-AVAR. These limitations mainly arise from its reliance on an outdated diffusion framework and its low sampling efficiency due to long sampling trajectories. To address these issues, we propose an improved CCDM framework, termed iCCDM, which incorporates the more advanced \textit{Elucidated Diffusion Model} (EDM) framework with substantial modifications to improve both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Specifically, iCCDM introduces a novel matrix-form EDM formulation together with an adaptive vicinal training strategy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, spanning image resolutions from $64\times64$ to $256\times256$, demonstrate that iCCDM consistently outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX.1, and Qwen-Image), achieving higher generation quality while significantly reducing sampling cost.</description>

      <title>MLV-Edit: Towards Consistent and Highly Efficient Editing for Minute-Level Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MLV-Edit, a training-free, flow-based framework that address the unique challenges of minute-level video editing. While existing techniques excel in short-form video manipulation, scaling them to long-duration videos remains challenging due to prohibitive computational overhead and the difficulty of maintaining global temporal consistency across thousands of frames. To address this, MLV-Edit employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for segment-wise editing, facilitated by two core modules: Velocity Blend rectifies motion inconsistencies at segment boundaries by aligning the flow fields of adjacent chunks, eliminating flickering and boundary artifacts commonly observed in fragmented video processing; and Attention Sink anchors local segment features to global reference frames, effectively suppressing cumulative structural drift. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MLV-Edit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal stability and semantic fidelity.</description>

      <title>Toxicity Assessment in Preclinical Histopathology via Class-Aware Mahalanobis Distance for Known and Novel Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-induced toxicity remains a leading cause of failure in preclinical development and early clinical trials. Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven histopathology to support preclinical workflows, reduce late-stage failures, and improve efficiency in drug development.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Registration Bias in Synthetic CT Generation: A Physics-Based Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised synthetic CT generation from CBCT requires registered training pairs, yet perfect registration between separately acquired scans remains unattainable. This registration bias propagates into trained models and corrupts standard evaluation metrics. This may suggest that superior benchmark performance indicates better reproduction of registration artifacts rather than anatomical fidelity. We propose physics-based CBCT simulation to provide geometrically aligned training pairs by construction, combined with evaluation using geometric alignment metrics against input CBCT rather than biased ground truth. On two independent pelvic datasets, models trained on synthetic data achieved superior geometric alignment (Normalized Mutual Information: 0.31 vs 0.22) despite lower conventional intensity scores. Intensity metrics showed inverted correlations with clinical assessment for deformably registered data, while Normalized Mutual Information consistently predicted observer preference across registration methodologies (rho = 0.31, p &lt; 0.001). Clinical observers preferred synthetic-trained outputs in 87% of cases, demonstrating that geometric fidelity, not intensity agreement with biased ground truth, aligns with clinical requirements.</description>

      <title>Deep learning enables urban change profiling through alignment of historical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior to modern Earth observation technologies, historical maps provide a unique record of long-term urban transformation and offer a lens on the evolving identity of cities. However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.</description>

      <title>LoopViT: Scaling Visual ARC with Looped Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width. The code is available at https://github.com/WenjieShu/LoopViT.</description>

      <title>Reg4Pru: Regularisation Through Random Token Routing for Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are widely adopted in modern vision models due to their strong ability to scale with dataset size and generalisability. However, this comes with a major drawback: computation scales quadratically to the total number of tokens. Numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate this. For example, we consider token pruning with reactivating tokens from preserved representations, but the increased computational efficiency of this method results in decreased stability from the preserved representations, leading to poorer dense prediction performance at deeper layers. In this work, we introduce Reg4Pru, a training regularisation technique that mitigates token-pruning performance loss for segmentation. We compare our models on the FIVES blood vessel segmentation dataset and find that Reg4Pru improves average precision by an absolute 46% compared to the same model trained without routing. This increase is observed using a configuration that achieves a 29% relative speedup in wall-clock time compared to the non-pruned baseline. These findings indicate that Reg4Pru is a valuable regulariser for token reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>Lung Nodule Image Synthesis Driven by Two-Stage Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited sample size and insufficient diversity of lung nodule CT datasets severely restrict the performance and generalization ability of detection models. Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models.</description>

      <title>CIEC: Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues for Multimodal Weakly Supervised Manipulation Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the threat of misinformation, multimodal manipulation localization has garnered growing attention. Consider that current methods rely on costly and time-consuming fine-grained annotations, such as patch/token-level annotations. This paper proposes a novel framework named Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues (CIEC), which aims to achieve multimodal weakly-supervised manipulation localization for image-text pairs utilizing only coarse-grained image/sentence-level annotations. It comprises two branches, image-based and text-based weakly-supervised localization. For the former, we devise the Textual-guidance Refine Patch Selection (TRPS) module. It integrates forgery cues from both visual and textual perspectives to lock onto suspicious regions aided by spatial priors. Followed by the background silencing and spatial contrast constraints to suppress interference from irrelevant areas. For the latter, we devise the Visual-deviation Calibrated Token Grounding (VCTG) module. It focuses on meaningful content words and leverages relative visual bias to assist token localization. Followed by the asymmetric sparse and semantic consistency constraints to mitigate label noise and ensure reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our CIEC, yielding results comparable to fully supervised methods on several evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Vision-DeepResearch Benchmark: Rethinking Visual and Textual Search for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced VQA and now support Vision-DeepResearch systems that use search engines for complex visual-textual fact-finding. However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch.</description>

      <title>Learning Topology-Aware Implicit Field for Unified Pulmonary Tree Modeling with Incomplete Topological Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary trees extracted from CT images frequently exhibit topological incompleteness, such as missing or disconnected branches, which substantially degrades downstream anatomical analysis and limits the applicability of existing pulmonary tree modeling pipelines. Current approaches typically rely on dense volumetric processing or explicit graph reasoning, leading to limited efficiency and reduced robustness under realistic structural corruption. We propose TopoField, a topology-aware implicit modeling framework that treats topology repair as a first-class modeling problem and enables unified multi-task inference for pulmonary tree analysis. TopoField represents pulmonary anatomy using sparse surface and skeleton point clouds and learns a continuous implicit field that supports topology repair without relying on complete or explicit disconnection annotations, by training on synthetically introduced structural disruptions over \textit{already} incomplete trees. Building upon the repaired implicit representation, anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction are jointly inferred through task-specific implicit functions within a single forward pass.Extensive experiments on the Lung3D+ dataset demonstrate that TopoField consistently improves topological completeness and achieves accurate anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction under challenging incomplete scenarios. Owing to its implicit formulation, TopoField attains high computational efficiency, completing all tasks in just over one second per case, highlighting its practicality for large-scale and time-sensitive clinical applications. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/HINTLab/TopoField.</description>

      <title>SSI-DM: Singularity Skipping Inversion of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverting real images into the noise space is essential for editing tasks using diffusion models, yet existing methods produce non-Gaussian noise with poor editability due to the inaccuracy in early noising steps. We identify the root cause: a mathematical singularity that renders inversion fundamentally ill-posed. We propose Singularity Skipping Inversion of Diffusion Models (SSI-DM), which bypasses this singular region by adding small noise before standard inversion. This simple approach produces inverted noise with natural Gaussian properties while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a plug-and-play technique compatible with general diffusion models, our method achieves superior performance on public image datasets for reconstruction and interpolation tasks, providing a principled and efficient solution to diffusion model inversion.</description>

      <title>MAIN-VLA: Modeling Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in Visual-Language-Action (VLA), in highly complex and dynamic environments that involve real-time unpredictable interactions (such as 3D open worlds and large-scale PvP games), existing approaches remain inefficient at extracting action-critical signals from redundant sensor streams. To tackle this, we introduce MAIN-VLA, a framework that explicitly Models the Abstraction of Intention and eNvironment to ground decision-making in deep semantic alignment rather than superficial pattern matching. Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance. Extensive experiments in open-world Minecraft and large-scale PvP environments (Game for Peace and Valorant) demonstrate that MAIN-VLA sets a new state-of-the-art, which achieves superior decision quality, stronger generalization, and cutting-edge inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>Causal Forcing: Autoregressive Diffusion Distillation Done Right for High-Quality Real-Time Interactive Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

      <title>LangMap: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Open-Vocabulary Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationships between objects and language are fundamental to meaningful communication between humans and AI, and to practically useful embodied intelligence. We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging. HieraNav and LangMap establish a rigorous testbed for advancing language-driven embodied navigation. Project: https://bo-miao.github.io/LangMap</description>

      <title>MIRROR: Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity generative models have narrowed the perceptual gap between synthetic and real images, posing serious threats to media security. Most existing AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors rely on artifact-based classification and struggle to generalize to evolving generative traces. In contrast, human judgment relies on stable real-world regularities, with deviations from the human cognitive manifold serving as a more generalizable signal of forgery. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate AIGI detection as a Reference-Comparison problem that verifies consistency with the real-image manifold rather than fitting specific forgery cues. We propose MIRROR (Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR), a framework that explicitly encodes reality priors using a learnable discrete memory bank. MIRROR projects an input into a manifold-consistent ideal reference via sparse linear combination, and uses the resulting residuals as robust detection signals. To evaluate whether detectors reach the "superhuman crossover" required to replace human experts, we introduce the Human-AIGI benchmark, featuring a psychophysically curated human-imperceptible subset. Across 14 benchmarks, MIRROR consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving gains of 2.1% on six standard benchmarks and 8.1% on seven in-the-wild benchmarks. On Human-AIGI, MIRROR reaches 89.6% accuracy across 27 generators, surpassing both lay users and visual experts, and further approaching the human perceptual limit as pretrained backbones scale. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/349793927/MIRROR</description>

      <title>Evaluating OCR Performance for Assistive Technology: Effects of Walking Speed, Camera Placement, and Camera Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical character recognition (OCR), which converts printed or handwritten text into machine-readable form, is widely used in assistive technology for people with blindness and low vision. Yet, most evaluations rely on static datasets that do not reflect the challenges of mobile use. In this study, we systematically evaluated OCR performance under both static and dynamic conditions. Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Show, Don't Tell: Morphing Latent Reasoning into Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generation--a hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\%$ on GenEval and $25\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\%$ and $11\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\%$ and token consumption by $51\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.</description>

      <title>LiFlow: Flow Matching for 3D LiDAR Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving scenarios, the collected LiDAR point clouds can be challenged by occlusion and long-range sparsity, limiting the perception of autonomous driving systems. Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds. LiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. Code: https://github.com/matteandre/LiFlow.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Indoor Occupancy Prediction via Sparse Query-Based Multi-Level Consistent Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occupancy prediction provides critical geometric and semantic understanding for robotics but faces efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS{\dag}. With depth integration, DiScene{\dag} attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\times$ faster inference speed. Furthermore, experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and in-the-wild scenarios demonstrate the versatility of our approach in various environments.

      <title>VQ-Style: Disentangling Style and Content in Motion with Residual Quantized Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending.</description>

      <title>LongVPO: From Anchored Cues to Self-Reasoning for Long-Form Video Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LongVPO, a novel two-stage Direct Preference Optimization framework that enables short-context vision-language models to robustly understand ultra-long videos without any long-video annotations. In Stage 1, we synthesize preference triples by anchoring questions to individual short clips, interleaving them with distractors, and applying visual-similarity and question-specificity filtering to mitigate positional bias and ensure unambiguous supervision. We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding.</description>

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) has proven to be accurate and efficient in various domains. In this work, we explore how different neural networks can be designed as a new texture INR, which operates in a continuous manner rather than a discrete one over the input UV coordinate space. Through thorough experiments, we demonstrate that these INRs perform well in terms of image quality, with considerable memory usage and rendering inference time. We analyze the balance between these objectives. In addition, we investigate various related applications in real-time rendering and down-stream tasks, e.g. mipmap fitting and INR-space generation.</description>

      <title>NAB: Neural Adaptive Binning for Sparse-View CT reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in inspecting the internal structures of industrial objects. Furthermore, achieving high-quality CT reconstruction from sparse views is essential for reducing production costs. While classic implicit neural networks have shown promising results for sparse reconstruction, they are unable to leverage shape priors of objects. Motivated by the observation that numerous industrial objects exhibit rectangular structures, we propose a novel \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{B}inning (\textbf{NAB}) method that effectively integrates rectangular priors into the reconstruction process. Specifically, our approach first maps coordinate space into a binned vector space. This mapping relies on an innovative binning mechanism based on differences between shifted hyperbolic tangent functions, with our extension enabling rotations around the input-plane normal vector. The resulting representations are then processed by a neural network to predict CT attenuation coefficients. This design enables end-to-end optimization of the encoding parameters -- including position, size, steepness, and rotation -- via gradient flow from the projection data, thus enhancing reconstruction accuracy. By adjusting the smoothness of the binning function, NAB can generalize to objects with more complex geometries. This research provides a new perspective on integrating shape priors into neural network-based reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAB achieves superior performance on two industrial datasets. It also maintains robust on medical datasets when the binning function is extended to more general expression. The code will be made available.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Image Classification In Biomedical Imaging Using Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate histopathologic interpretation is key for clinical decision-making; however, current deep learning models for digital pathology are often overconfident and poorly calibrated in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, which limit trust and clinical adoption. Safety-critical medical imaging workflows benefit from intrinsic uncertainty-aware properties that can accurately reject OOD input. We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.</description>

      <title>Personalized Image Generation via Human-in-the-loop Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</description>

      <title>Infinite-World: Scaling Interactive World Models to 1000-Frame Horizons via Pose-Free Hierarchical Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Infinite-World, a robust interactive world model capable of maintaining coherent visual memory over 1000+ frames in complex real-world environments. While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities. Extensive experiments, including objective metrics and user studies, demonstrate that Infinite-World achieves superior performance in visual quality, action controllability, and spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>Superman: Unifying Skeleton and Vision for Human Motion Perception and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion analysis tasks, such as temporal 3D pose estimation, motion prediction, and motion in-betweening, play an essential role in computer vision. However, current paradigms suffer from severe fragmentation. First, the field is split between ``perception'' models that understand motion from video but only output text, and ``generation'' models that cannot perceive from raw visual input. Second, generative MLLMs are often limited to single-frame, static poses using dense, parametric SMPL models, failing to handle temporal motion. Third, existing motion vocabularies are built from skeleton data alone, severing the link to the visual domain. To address these challenges, we introduce Superman, a unified framework that bridges visual perception with temporal, skeleton-based motion generation. Our solution is twofold. First, to overcome the modality disconnect, we propose a Vision-Guided Motion Tokenizer. Leveraging the natural geometric alignment between 3D skeletons and visual data, this module pioneers robust joint learning from both modalities, creating a unified, cross-modal motion vocabulary. Second, grounded in this motion language, a single, unified MLLM architecture is trained to handle all tasks. This module flexibly processes diverse, temporal inputs, unifying 3D skeleton pose estimation from video (perception) with skeleton-based motion prediction and in-betweening (generation). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, demonstrate that our unified method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all motion tasks. This showcases a more efficient and scalable path for generative motion analysis using skeletons.</description>

      <title>ReasonEdit: Editing Vision-Language Models using Human Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors in large, pretrained models without altering unrelated behaviors. While some recent works have edited vision-language models (VLMs), no existing editors tackle reasoning-heavy tasks, which typically require humans and models to reason about images.We therefore propose ReasonEdit, the first VLM editor to let users explain their reasoning during editing, introducing a new, practical model editing setup. ReasonEdit continuously stores human reasoning in a codebook, and retrieves only relevant facts during inference using a novel topology-balanced multimodal embedding method inspired by network science. Across four VLMs on multiple rationale-based visual question answering datasets, ReasonEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance, ultimately showing that using human reasoning during editing greatly improves edit generalization.</description>

      <title>Catalyst: Out-of-Distribution Detection via Elastic Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of deep neural networks. State-of-the-art post-hoc methods typically derive OOD scores from the output logits or penultimate feature vector obtained via global average pooling (GAP). We contend that this exclusive reliance on the logit or feature vector discards a rich, complementary signal: the raw channel-wise statistics of the pre-pooling feature map lost in GAP. In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($\gamma$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $\gamma$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50). Our results highlight the untapped potential of pre-pooling statistics and demonstrate that Catalyst is complementary to existing OOD detection approaches.</description>

      <title>SelvaMask: Segmenting Trees in Tropical Forests and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical forests harbor most of the planet's tree biodiversity and are critical to global ecological balance. Canopy trees in particular play a disproportionate role in carbon storage and functioning of these ecosystems. Studying canopy trees at scale requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns, typically performed using high-resolution aerial imagery. Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a modular detection-segmentation pipeline that adapts vision foundation models (VFMs), using domain-specific detection-prompter. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests. We validate these gains on external tropical and temperate datasets, demonstrating that SelvaMask serves as both a challenging benchmark and a key enabler for generalized forest monitoring. Our code and dataset will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>UniReason 1.0: A Unified Reasoning Framework for World Knowledge Aligned Image Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through a dual reasoning paradigm. We formulate generation as world knowledge-enhanced planning to inject implicit constraints, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-head automated segmentation by incorporating detection head into the contextual layer neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based auto segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, but conventional models often produce anatomically implausible false positives, or hallucinations, in slices lacking target structures. We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows.</description>

      <title>PixelGen: Pixel Diffusion Beats Latent Diffusion with Perceptual Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel diffusion generates images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end manner, avoiding the artifacts and bottlenecks introduced by VAEs in two-stage latent diffusion. However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/PixelGen.</description>

      <title>Happy Young Women, Grumpy Old Men? Emotion-Driven Demographic Biases in Synthetic Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic face generation has rapidly advanced with the emergence of text-to-image (T2I) and of multimodal large language models, enabling high-fidelity image production from natural-language prompts. Despite the widespread adoption of these tools, the biases, representational quality, and cross-cultural consistency of these models remain poorly understood. Prior research on biases in the synthetic generation of human faces has examined demographic biases, yet there is little research on how emotional prompts influence demographic representation and how models trained in different cultural and linguistic contexts vary in their output distributions. We present a systematic audit of eight state-of-the-art T2I models comprising four models developed by Western organizations and four developed by Chinese institutions, all prompted identically. Using state-of-the-art facial analysis algorithms, we estimate the gender, race, age, and attractiveness levels in the generated faces. To measure the deviations from global population statistics, we apply information-theoretic bias metrics including Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences. Our findings reveal persistent demographic and emotion-conditioned biases in all models regardless of their country of origin. We discuss implications for fairness, socio-technical harms, governance, and the development of transparent generative systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lossless compression method for unit-norm embeddings that achieves 1.5$\times$ compression, 25\% better than the best prior method. The method exploits that spherical coordinates of high-dimensional unit vectors concentrate around $\pi/2$, causing IEEE 754 exponents to collapse to a single value and enabling entropy coding. Evaluation across 26 configurations spanning text, image, and multi-vector embeddings confirms consistent improvement. The method requires no training and is fully lossless within float32 precision.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Controlling Model Behavior via Constitutions for Atomic Concept Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a black-box interpretability framework that learns a verifiable constitution: a natural language summary of how changes to a prompt affect a model's specific behavior, such as its alignment, correctness, or adherence to constraints. Our method leverages atomic concept edits (ACEs), which are targeted operations that add, remove, or replace an interpretable concept in the input prompt. By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected. Moreover, our results show that the learned constitutions are highly effective for controlling model behavior, achieving an average of 1.86 times boost in success rate over methods that do not use constitutions.</description>

      <title>Frequent Pattern Mining approach to Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on Image Compression, explaining efficient approaches based on Frequent Pattern Mining(FPM). The proposed compression mechanism is based on clustering similar pixels in the image and thus using cluster identifiers in image compression. Redundant data in the image is effectively handled by replacing the DCT phase of conventional JPEG through a mixture of k-means Clustering and Closed Frequent Sequence Mining. To optimize the cardinality of pattern(s) in encoding, efficient pruning techniques have been used through the refinement of Conventional Generalized Sequential Pattern Mining(GSP) algorithm. We have proposed a mechanism for finding the frequency of a sequence which will yield significant reduction in the code table size. The algorithm is tested by compressing benchmark datasets yielding an improvement of 45% in compression ratios, often outperforming the existing alternatives. PSNR and SSIM, which are the image quality metrics, have been tested which show a negligible loss in visual quality.</description>

      <title>Visual Affect Analysis: Predicting Emotions of Image Viewers with Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as tools for inferring affect from visual stimuli at scale; it is not yet clear how closely their outputs align with human affective ratings. We benchmarked nine VLMs, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to open-source models, on three psycho-metrically validated affective image datasets: the International Affective Picture System, the Nencki Affective Picture System, and the Library of AI-Generated Affective Images. The models performed two tasks in the zero-shot setting: (i) top-emotion classification (selecting the strongest discrete emotion elicited by an image) and (ii) continuous prediction of human ratings on 1-7/9 Likert scales for discrete emotion categories and affective dimensions. We also evaluated the impact of rater-conditioned prompting on the LAI-GAI dataset using de-identified participant metadata. The results show good performance in discrete emotion classification, with accuracies typically ranging from 60% to 80% on six-emotion labels and from 60% to 75% on a more challenging 12-category task. The predictions of anger and surprise had the lowest accuracy in all datasets. For continuous rating prediction, models showed moderate to strong alignment with humans (r &gt; 0.75) but also exhibited consistent biases, notably weaker performance on arousal, and a tendency to overestimate response strength. Rater-conditioned prompting resulted in only small, inconsistent changes in predictions. Overall, VLMs capture broad affective trends but lack the nuance found in validated psychological ratings, highlighting their potential and current limitations for affective computing and mental health-related applications.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Semantic Loss Model for Deep JSCC-based Transmission of EO Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Earth Observation (EO) systems increasingly rely on high-resolution imagery to support critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. Although these applications benefit from detailed visual data, the resulting data volumes impose significant challenges on satellite communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth, power, and dynamic link conditions. To address these limitations, this paper investigates Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) as an effective source-channel paradigm for the transmission of EO imagery. We focus on two complementary aspects of semantic loss in DJSCC-based systems. First, a reconstruction-centric framework is evaluated by analyzing the semantic degradation of reconstructed images under varying compression ratios and channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Second, a task-oriented framework is developed by integrating DJSCC with lightweight, application-specific models (e.g., EfficientViT), with performance measured using downstream task accuracy rather than pixel-level fidelity. Based on extensive empirical analysis, we propose a unified semantic loss framework that captures both reconstruction-centric and task-oriented performance within a single model. This framework characterizes the implicit relationship between JSCC compression, channel SNR, and semantic quality, offering actionable insights for the design of robust and efficient EO imagery transmission under resource-constrained satellite links.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Image Processing Models in Quark Gluon Jet Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of convolutional and transformer-based models for distinguishing quark and gluon jets using simulated jet images from Pythia 8. By encoding jet substructure into a three-channel representation of particle kinematics, we evaluate the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Swin Transformers (Swin-Tiny) under both supervised and self-supervised learning setups. Our results show that fine-tuning only the final two transformer blocks of the Swin-Tiny model achieves the best trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, reaching 81.4% accuracy and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 88.9%. Self-supervised pretraining with Momentum Contrast (MoCo) further enhances feature robustness and reduces the number of trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hierarchical attention-based models for jet substructure studies and for domain transfer to real collision data.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Forgetting: Attack Unlearned Diffusion via Initial Latent Variable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although unlearning-based defenses claim to purge Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) concepts from diffusion models (DMs), we reveals that this "forgetting" is largely an illusion. Unlearning partially disrupts the mapping between linguistic symbols and the underlying knowledge, which remains intact as dormant memories. We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used unlearning techniques demonstrate that IVO achieves superior attack success rates and strong semantic consistency, exposing fundamental flaws in current defenses. The code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/IVO/. Warning: This paper has unsafe images that may offend some readers.</description>

      <title>RPP: A Certified Poisoned-Sample Detection Framework for Backdoor Attacks under Dataset Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, yet most defense methods to date rely on balanced data, overlooking the pervasive class imbalance in real-world scenarios that can amplify backdoor threats. This paper presents the first in-depth investigation of how the dataset imbalance amplifies backdoor vulnerability, showing that (i) the imbalance induces a majority-class bias that increases susceptibility and (ii) conventional defenses degrade significantly as the imbalance grows. To address this, we propose Randomized Probability Perturbation (RPP), a certified poisoned-sample detection framework that operates in a black-box setting using only model output probabilities. For any inspected sample, RPP determines whether the input has been backdoor-manipulated, while offering provable within-domain detectability guarantees and a probabilistic upper bound on the false positive rate. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet and ImageNet10) covering 10 backdoor attacks and 12 baseline defenses show that RPP achieves significantly higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art defenses, particularly under dataset imbalance. RPP establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for defending against backdoor attacks in real-world environments with imbalanced data.</description>

      <title>Visible Singularities Guided Correlation Network for Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers the advantages of reduced radiation dose and shortened scanning time. Traditional reconstruction algorithms exhibit various inherent limitations in LACT. Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yqx7150/VSGC.</description>

      <title>SurfelSoup: Learned Point Cloud Geometry Compression With a Probablistic SurfelTree Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SurfelSoup, an end-to-end learned surface-based framework for point cloud geometry compression, with surface-structured primitives for representation. It proposes a probabilistic surface representation, pSurfel, which models local point occupancies using a bounded generalized Gaussian distribution. In addition, the pSurfels are organized into an octree-like hierarchy, pSurfelTree, with a Tree Decision module that adaptively terminates the tree subdivision for rate-distortion optimal Surfel granularity selection. This formulation avoids redundant point-wise compression in smooth regions and produces compact yet smooth surface reconstructions. Experimental results under the MPEG common test condition show consistent gain on geometry compression over voxel-based baselines and MPEG standard G-PCC-GesTM-TriSoup, while providing visually superior reconstructions with smooth and coherent surface structures.</description>

      <title>From Gameplay Traces to Game Mechanics: Causal Induction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning agents can achieve high performance in complex game domains without often understanding the underlying causal game mechanics. To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.</description>

      <title>GEPC: Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models learn a time-indexed score field $\mathbf{s}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_t,t)$ that often inherits approximate equivariances (flips, rotations, circular shifts) from in-distribution (ID) data and convolutional backbones. Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

      <title>Reducing Class-Wise Performance Disparity via Margin Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often exhibit substantial disparities in class-wise accuracy, even when trained on class-balanced data, posing concerns for reliable deployment. While prior efforts have explored empirical remedies, a theoretical understanding of such performance disparities in classification remains limited. In this work, we present Margin Regularization for Performance Disparity Reduction (MR$^2$), a theoretically principled regularization for classification by dynamically adjusting margins in both the logit and representation spaces. Our analysis establishes a margin-based, class-sensitive generalization bound that reveals how per-class feature variability contributes to error, motivating the use of larger margins for hard classes. Guided by this insight, MR$^2$ optimizes per-class logit margins proportional to feature spread and penalizes excessive representation margins to enhance intra-class compactness. Experiments on seven datasets, including ImageNet, and diverse pre-trained backbones (MAE, MoCov2, CLIP) demonstrate that MR$^2$ not only improves overall accuracy but also significantly boosts hard class performance without trading off easy classes, thus reducing performance disparity.

      <title>A Renderer-Enabled Framework for Computing Parameter Estimation Lower Bounds in Plenoptic Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on assessing the information-theoretic limits of scene parameter estimation in plenoptic imaging systems. A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advanced Geometric Correction Algorithms for 3D Medical Reconstruction: Comparison of Computed Tomography and Macroscopic Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid two-stage registration framework for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) kidney anatomy from macroscopic slices, using CT-derived models as the geometric reference standard. The approach addresses the data-scarcity and high-distortion challenges typical of macroscopic imaging, where fully learning-based registration (e.g., VoxelMorph) often fails to generalize due to limited training diversity and large nonrigid deformations that exceed the capture range of unconstrained convolutional filters. In the proposed pipeline, the Optimal Cross-section Matching (OCM) algorithm first performs constrained global alignment: translation, rotation, and uniform scaling to establish anatomically consistent slice initialization. Next, a lightweight deep-learning refinement network, inspired by VoxelMorph, predicts residual local deformations between consecutive slices. The core novelty of this architecture lies in its hierarchical decomposition of the registration manifold. This hybrid OCM+DL design integrates explicit geometric priors with the flexible learning capacity of neural networks, ensuring stable optimization and plausible deformation fields even with few training examples. Experiments on an original dataset of 40 kidneys demonstrated better results compared to single-stage baselines. The pipeline maintains physical calibration via Hough-based grid detection and employs Bezier-based contour smoothing for robust meshing and volume estimation. Although validated on kidney data, the proposed framework generalizes to other soft-tissue organs reconstructed from optical or photographic cross-sections. By decoupling interpretable global optimization from data-efficient deep refinement, the method advances the precision, reproducibility, and anatomical realism of multimodal 3D reconstructions for surgical planning, morphological assessment, and medical education.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vanilla GAN, DCGAN, and WGAN Architectures for MRI Reconstruction: A Quantitative Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial imaging modality for viewing internal body structures. This research work analyses the performance of popular GAN models for accurate and precise MRI reconstruction by enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic accuracy. Three GAN architectures considered in this study are Vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). They were trained and evaluated using knee, brain, and cardiac MRI datasets to assess their generalizability across body regions. While the Vanilla GAN operates on the fundamentals of the adversarial network setup, DCGAN advances image synthesis by securing the convolutional layers, giving a superior appearance to the prevalent spatial features. Training instability is resolved in WGAN through the Wasserstein distance to minimize an unstable regime, therefore, ensuring stable convergence and high-quality images. The GAN models were trained and tested using 1000 MR images of an anonymized knee, 805 images of Heart, 90 images of Brain MRI dataset. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for Vanilla GAN is 0.84, DCGAN is 0.97, and WGAN is 0.99. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for Vanilla GAN is 26, DCGAN is 49.3, and WGAN is 43.5. The results were further statistically validated. This study shows that DCGAN and WGAN-based frameworks are promising in MR image reconstruction because of good image quality and superior accuracy. With the first cross-organ benchmark of baseline GANs under a common preprocessing pipeline, this work provides a reproducible benchmark for future hybrid GANs and clinical MRI applications.</description>

      <title>MapDream: Task-Driven Map Learning for Vision-Language Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions in partially observed 3D environments, motivating map representations that aggregate spatial context beyond local perception. However, most existing approaches rely on hand-crafted maps constructed independently of the navigation policy. We argue that maps should instead be learned representations shaped directly by navigation objectives rather than exhaustive reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose MapDream, a map-in-the-loop framework that formulates map construction as autoregressive bird's-eye-view (BEV) image synthesis. The framework jointly learns map generation and action prediction, distilling environmental context into a compact three-channel BEV map that preserves only navigation-critical affordances. Supervised pre-training bootstraps a reliable mapping-to-control interface, while the autoregressive design enables end-to-end joint optimization through reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE achieve state-of-the-art monocular performance, validating task-driven generative map learning.</description>

      <title>Dual Quaternion SE(3) Synchronization with Recovery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization over the special Euclidean group SE(3) aims to recover absolute poses from noisy pairwise relative transformations and is a core primitive in robotics and 3D vision. Standard approaches often require multi-step heuristic procedures to recover valid poses, which are difficult to analyze and typically lack theoretical guarantees. This paper adopts a dual quaternion representation and formulates SE(3) synchronization directly over the unit dual quaternion. A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-scan point-set registration demonstrate that the proposed pipeline improves both accuracy and efficiency over representative matrix-based methods.</description>

      <title>A 30-item Test for Assessing Chinese Character Amnesia in Child Handwriters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwriting literacy is an important skill for learning and communication in school-age children. In the digital age, handwriting has been largely replaced by typing, leading to a decline in handwriting proficiency, particularly in non-alphabetic writing systems. Among children learning Chinese, a growing number have reported experiencing character amnesia: difficulty in correctly handwriting a character despite being able to recognize it. Given that there is currently no standardized diagnostic tool for assessing character amnesia in children, we developed an assessment to measure Chinese character amnesia in Mandarin-speaking school-age population. We utilised a large-scale handwriting dataset in which 40 children handwrote 800 characters from dictation prompts. Character amnesia and correct handwriting responses were analysed using a two-parameter Item Response Theory model. Four item-selection schemes were compared: random baseline, maximum discrimination, diverse difficulty, and an upper-and-lower-thirds discrimination score. Candidate item subsets were evaluated using out-of-sample prediction. Among these selection schemes, the upper-and-lower-thirds discrimination procedure yields a compact 30-item test that preserves individual-difference structure and generalizes to unseen test-takers (cross-validated mean r =.74 with full 800-item-test; within-sample r =.93). This short-form test provides a reliable and efficient tool of assessing Chinese character amnesia in children and can be used to identify early handwriting and orthographic learning difficulties, contributing to the early detection of developmental dysgraphia and related literacy challenges.</description>

      <title>Dual Latent Memory for Visual Multi-agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Visual Multi-Agent Systems (VMAS) promise to enhance comprehensive abilities through inter-agent collaboration, empirical evidence reveals a counter-intuitive "scaling wall": increasing agent turns often degrades performance while exponentially inflating token costs. We attribute this failure to the information bottleneck inherent in text-centric communication, where converting perceptual and thinking trajectories into discrete natural language inevitably induces semantic loss. To this end, we propose L$^{2}$-VMAS, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables inter-agent collaboration with dual latent memories. Furthermore, we decouple the perception and thinking while dynamically synthesizing dual latent memories. Additionally, we introduce an entropy-driven proactive triggering that replaces passive information transmission with efficient, on-demand memory access. Extensive experiments among backbones, sizes, and multi-agent structures demonstrate that our method effectively breaks the "scaling wall" with superb scalability, improving average accuracy by 2.7-5.4% while reducing token usage by 21.3-44.8%.

      <title>Recent Advances of End-to-End Video Coding Technologies for AVS Standard Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video coding standards are essential to enable the interoperability and widespread adoption of efficient video compression technologies. In pursuit of greater video compression efficiency, the AVS video coding working group launched the standardization exploration of end-to-end intelligent video coding, establishing the AVS End-to-End Intelligent Video Coding Exploration Model (AVS-EEM) project. A core design principle of AVS-EEM is its focus on practical deployment, featuring inherently low computational complexity and requiring strict adherence to the common test conditions of conventional video coding. This paper details the development history of AVS-EEM and provides a systematic introduction to its key technical framework, covering model architectures, training strategies, and inference optimizations. These innovations have collectively driven the project's rapid performance evolution, enabling continuous and significant gains under strict complexity constraints. Through over two years of iterative refinement and collaborative effort, the coding performance of AVS-EEM has seen substantial improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that its latest model achieves superior compression efficiency compared to the conventional AVS3 reference software, marking a significant step toward a deployable intelligent video coding standard.</description>

      <title>APEX: A Decoupled Memory-based Explorer for Asynchronous Aerial Object Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial Object Goal Navigation, a challenging frontier in Embodied AI, requires an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agent to autonomously explore, reason, and identify a specific target using only visual perception and language description. However, existing methods struggle with the memorization of complex spatial representations in aerial environments, reliable and interpretable action decision-making, and inefficient exploration and information gathering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{APEX} (Aerial Parallel Explorer), a novel hierarchical agent designed for efficient exploration and target acquisition in complex aerial settings. APEX is built upon a modular, three-part architecture: 1) Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Mapping Memory, which leverages the zero-shot capability of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to dynamically construct high-resolution 3D Attraction, Exploration, and Obstacle maps, serving as an interpretable memory mechanism. 2) Action Decision Module, trained with reinforcement learning, which translates this rich spatial understanding into a fine-grained and robust control policy. 3) Target Grounding Module, which employs an open-vocabulary detector to achieve definitive and generalizable target identification. All these components are integrated into a hierarchical, asynchronous, and parallel framework, effectively bypassing the VLM's inference latency and boosting the agent's proactivity in exploration. Extensive experiments show that APEX outperforms the previous state of the art by +4.2\% SR and +2.8\% SPL on challenging UAV-ON benchmarks, demonstrating its superior efficiency and the effectiveness of its hierarchical asynchronous design.

      <title>When Classes Evolve: A Benchmark and Framework for Stage-Aware Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially learn new classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Conventional CIL approaches implicitly assume that classes are morphologically static, focusing primarily on preserving previously learned representations as new classes are introduced. However, this assumption neglects intra-class evolution: a phenomenon wherein instances of the same semantic class undergo significant morphological transformations, such as a larva turning into a butterfly. Consequently, a model must both discriminate between classes and adapt to evolving appearances within a single class. To systematically address this challenge, we formalize Stage-Aware CIL (Stage-CIL), a paradigm in which each class is learned progressively through distinct morphological stages. To facilitate rigorous evaluation within this paradigm, we introduce the Stage-Bench, a 10-domain, 2-stages dataset and protocol that jointly measure inter- and intra-class forgetting. We further propose STAGE, a novel method that explicitly learns abstract and transferable evolution patterns within a fixed-size memory pool. By decoupling semantic identity from transformation dynamics, STAGE enables accurate prediction of future morphologies based on earlier representations. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that STAGE consistently and substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in simultaneously addressing inter-class discrimination and intra-class morphological adaptation.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Binary Attention: An Energy-Efficient Fusion Framework for Audio-Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective multimodal fusion requires mechanisms that can capture complex cross-modal dependencies while remaining computationally scalable for real-world deployment. Existing audio-visual fusion approaches face a fundamental trade-off: attention-based methods effectively model cross-modal relationships but incur quadratic computational complexity that prevents hierarchical, multi-scale architectures, while efficient fusion strategies rely on simplistic concatenation that fails to extract complementary cross-modal information. We introduce CMQKA, a novel cross-modal fusion mechanism that achieves linear O(N) complexity through efficient binary operations, enabling scalable hierarchical fusion previously infeasible with conventional attention. CMQKA employs bidirectional cross-modal Query-Key attention to extract complementary spatiotemporal features and uses learnable residual fusion to preserve modality-specific characteristics while enriching representations with cross-modal information. Building upon CMQKA, we present SNNergy, an energy-efficient multimodal fusion framework with a hierarchical architecture that processes inputs through progressively decreasing spatial resolutions and increasing semantic abstraction. This multi-scale fusion capability allows the framework to capture both local patterns and global context across modalities. Implemented with event-driven binary spike operations, SNNergy achieves remarkable energy efficiency while maintaining fusion effectiveness and establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging audio-visual benchmarks, including CREMA-D, AVE, and UrbanSound8K-AV, significantly outperforming existing multimodal fusion baselines. Our framework advances multimodal fusion by introducing a scalable fusion mechanism that enables hierarchical cross-modal integration with practical energy efficiency for real-world audio-visual intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models Handle Long-Context Code? An Empirical Study on Visual Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context code due to window limitations. Existing textual code compression methods mitigate this via selective filtering but often disrupt dependency closure, causing semantic fragmentation. To address this, we introduce LongCodeOCR, a visual compression framework that renders code into compressed two-dimensional image sequences for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By preserving a global view, this approach avoids the dependency breakage inherent in filtering. We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion.
  Our results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\sim$1.7$\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\sim$4.3 hours to $\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens). Finally, our results characterize a fundamental coverage--fidelity trade-off: visual code compression retains broader context coverage to support global dependencies, yet faces fidelity bottlenecks on exactness-critical tasks; by contrast, textual code compression preserves symbol-level precision while sacrificing structural coverage.</description>

      <title>SyNeT: Synthetic Negatives for Traversability Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots to navigate complex outdoor environments safely. Existing self-supervised learning frameworks primarily rely on positive and unlabeled data; however, the lack of explicit negative data remains a critical limitation, hindering the model's ability to accurately identify diverse non-traversable regions. To address this issue, we introduce a method to explicitly construct synthetic negatives, representing plausible but non-traversable, and integrate them into vision-based traversability learning. Our approach is formulated as a training strategy that can be seamlessly integrated into both Positive-Unlabeled (PU) and Positive-Negative (PN) frameworks without modifying inference architectures. Complementing standard pixel-wise metrics, we introduce an object-centric FPR evaluation approach that analyzes predictions in regions where synthetic negatives are inserted. This evaluation provides an indirect measure of the model's ability to consistently identify non-traversable regions without additional manual labeling. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robustness and generalization across diverse environments.

      <title>CLAMP: Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained 2D image representations in behavior cloning policies has achieved great success and has become a standard approach for robotic manipulation. However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Universal and Transferable Jailbreak Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with vision encoders, enabling text generation conditioned on both images and text. However, this multimodal integration expands the attack surface by exposing the model to image-based jailbreaks crafted to induce harmful responses. Existing gradient-based jailbreak methods transfer poorly, as adversarial patterns overfit to a single white-box surrogate and fail to generalise to black-box models. In this work, we propose Universal and transferable jailbreak (UltraBreak), a framework that constrains adversarial patterns through transformations and regularisation in the vision space, while relaxing textual targets through semantic-based objectives. By defining its loss in the textual embedding space of the target LLM, UltraBreak discovers universal adversarial patterns that generalise across diverse jailbreak objectives. This combination of vision-level regularisation and semantically guided textual supervision mitigates surrogate overfitting and enables strong transferability across both models and attack targets. Extensive experiments show that UltraBreak consistently outperforms prior jailbreak methods. Further analysis reveals why earlier approaches fail to transfer, highlighting that smoothing the loss landscape via semantic objectives is crucial for enabling universal and transferable jailbreaks. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/kaiyuanCui/UltraBreak}{GitHub repository}.</description>

      <title>KAN We Flow? Advancing Robotic Manipulation with 3D Flow Matching via KAN &amp; RWKV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

      <title>Statistical MIA: Rethinking Membership Inference Attack for Reliable Unlearning Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is essential for enforcing the right to be forgotten in machine learning systems. A key challenge of MU is how to reliably audit whether a model has truly forgotten specified training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used for unlearning auditing, where samples that evade membership detection are often regarded as successfully forgotten. After carefully revisiting the reliability of MIA, we show that this assumption is flawed: failed membership inference does not imply true forgetting. We theoretically demonstrate that MIA-based auditing, when formulated as a binary classification problem, inevitably incurs statistical errors whose magnitude cannot be observed during the auditing process. This leads to overly optimistic evaluations of unlearning performance, while incurring substantial computational overhead due to shadow model training. To address these limitations, we propose Statistical Membership Inference Attack (SMIA), a novel training-free and highly effective auditing framework. SMIA directly compares the distributions of member and non-member data using statistical tests, eliminating the need for learned attack models. Moreover, SMIA outputs both a forgetting rate and a corresponding confidence interval, enabling quantified reliability of the auditing results. Extensive experiments show that SMIA provides more reliable auditing with significantly lower computational cost than existing MIA-based approaches. Notably, the theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness of SMIA suggest it as a new paradigm for reliable machine unlearning auditing.</description>

      <title>Bridging Lexical Ambiguity and Vision: A Mini Review on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a mini review of Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD), which is a multimodal extension of traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). VWSD helps tackle lexical ambiguity in vision-language tasks. While conventional WSD depends only on text and lexical resources, VWSD uses visual cues to find the right meaning of ambiguous words with minimal text input. The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques. It focuses on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and adapting to multiple languages. Quantitative results show that CLIP-based fine-tuned models and LLM-enhanced VWSD systems consistently perform better than zero-shot baselines, achieving gains of up to 6-8\% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). However, challenges still exist, such as limitations in context, model bias toward common meanings, a lack of multilingual datasets, and the need for better evaluation frameworks. The analysis highlights the growing overlap of CLIP alignment, diffusion generation, and LLM reasoning as the future path for strong, context-aware, and multilingual disambiguation systems.</description>

      <title>SimpleGPT: Improving GPT via A Simple Normalization Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit Transformer optimization through the lens of second-order geometry and establish a direct connection between architectural design, activation scale, the Hessian matrix, and the maximum tolerable learning rate. We introduce a simple normalization strategy, termed SimpleNorm, which stabilizes intermediate activation scales by construction. Then, by analyzing the Hessian of the loss with respect to network activations, we theoretically show that SimpleNorm significantly reduces the spectral norm of the Hessian, thereby permitting larger stable learning rates. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on large GPT models at parameter scales 1B, 1.4B, 7B and 8B. Empirically, SimpleGPT, our SimpleNorm-based network, tolerates learning rates 3$\times$-10$\times$ larger than standard convention, consistently demonstrates strong optimization stability, and achieves substantially better performance than well-established baselines. Specifically, when training 7B-scale models for 60K steps, SimpleGPT achieves a training loss that is 0.08 lower than that of LLaMA2 with QKNorm, reducing the loss from 2.290 to 2.208. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/SimpleGPT.</description>

      <title>MiTA Attention: Efficient Fast-Weight Scaling via a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attention operator in Transformers can be viewed as a two-layer fast-weight MLP, whose weights are dynamically instantiated from input tokens and whose width equals sequence length $N$. As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query. We call this strategy a Mixture of Top-$k$ Activations (MiTA), and refer to the resulting efficient mechanism as MiTA attention. Preliminary experiments on vision tasks demonstrate the promise of our MiTA attention and motivate further investigation on its optimization and broader applications in more challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Seeing, Hearing, and Knowing Together: Multimodal Strategies in Deepfake Videos Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As deepfake videos become increasingly difficult for people to recognise, understanding the strategies humans use is key to designing effective media literacy interventions. We conducted a study with 195 participants between the ages of 21 and 40, who judged real and deepfake videos, rated their confidence, and reported the cues they relied on across visual, audio, and knowledge strategies. Participants were more accurate with real videos than with deepfakes and showed lower expected calibration error for real content. Through association rule mining, we identified cue combinations that shaped performance. Visual appearance, vocal, and intuition often co-occurred for successful identifications, which highlights the importance of multimodal approaches in human detection. Our findings show which cues help or hinder detection and suggest directions for designing media literacy tools that guide effective cue use. Building on these insights can help people improve their identification skills and become more resilient to deceptive digital media.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Aligned Calibration for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis by progressively estimating a smooth transition from a Gaussian distribution of noise to a real image. Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>A texture-based framework for foundational ultrasound models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging modality, yet the images it produces are fundamentally unique, arising from tissue-dependent scattering, reflection, and speed-of-sound variations that produce a constrained set of characteristic textures that differ markedly from natural-image statistics. These acoustically driven patterns make ultrasound challenging for algorithms originally designed for natural images. To bridge this gap, the field has increasingly turned to foundation models, hoping to leverage their generalization capabilities. However, these models often falter in ultrasound applications because they are not designed for ultrasound physics, they are merely trained on ultrasound data. Therefore, it is essential to integrate ultrasound-specific domain knowledge into established learning frameworks. We achieve this by reformulating self-supervised learning as a texture-analysis problem, introducing texture ultrasound semantic analysis (TUSA). Using TUSA, models learn to leverage highly scalable contrastive methods to extract true domain-specific representations directly from simple B-mode images. We train a TUSA model on a combination of open-source, simulated, and in vivo data. The latent space is compared to several larger foundation models, demonstrating that our approach gives TUSA models better generalizability for difficult downstream tasks on unique online datasets as well as a clinical eye dataset collected for this study. Our model achieves higher accuracy in detecting COVID (70%), spinal hematoma (100%) and vitreous hemorrhage (97%) and correlates more closely with quantitative parameters like liver steatosis (r = 0.83), ejection fraction (r = 0.63), and oxygen saturation (r = 0.38). We open-source the model weights and training script: https://github.com/talg2324/tusa</description>

      <title>Rectified LpJEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures with Sparse and Maximum-Entropy Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) learn view-invariant representations and admit projection-based distribution matching for collapse prevention. Existing approaches regularize representations towards isotropic Gaussian distributions, but inherently favor dense representations and fail to capture the key property of sparsity observed in efficient representations. We introduce Rectified Distribution Matching Regularization (RDMReg), a sliced two-sample distribution-matching loss that aligns representations to a Rectified Generalized Gaussian (RGG) distribution. RGG enables explicit control over expected $\ell_0$ norm through rectification, while preserving maximum-entropy up to rescaling under expected $\ell_p$ norm constraints. Equipping JEPAs with RDMReg yields Rectified LpJEPA, which strictly generalizes prior Gaussian-based JEPAs. Empirically, Rectified LpJEPA learns sparse, non-negative representations with favorable sparsity-performance trade-offs and competitive downstream performance on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating that RDMReg effectively enforces sparsity while preserving task-relevant information.</description>

      <title>Community-Level Modeling of Gyral Folding Patterns for Robust and Anatomically Informed Individualized Brain Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical folding exhibits substantial inter-individual variability while preserving stable anatomical landmarks that enable fine-scale characterization of cortical organization. Among these, the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) serves as a key folding primitive, showing consistent topology yet meaningful variations in morphology, connectivity, and function. Existing landmark-based methods typically model each 3HG independently, ignoring that 3HGs form higher-order folding communities that capture mesoscale structure. This simplification weakens anatomical representation and makes one-to-one matching sensitive to positional variability and noise. We propose a spectral graph representation learning framework that models community-level folding units rather than isolated landmarks. Each 3HG is encoded using a dual-profile representation combining surface topology and structural connectivity. Subject-specific spectral clustering identifies coherent folding communities, followed by topological refinement to preserve anatomical continuity. For cross-subject correspondence, we introduce Joint Morphological-Geometric Matching, jointly optimizing geometric and morphometric similarity. Across over 1000 Human Connectome Project subjects, the resulting communities show reduced morphometric variance, stronger modular organization, improved hemispheric consistency, and superior alignment compared with atlas-based and landmark-based or embedding-based baselines. These findings demonstrate that community-level modeling provides a robust and anatomically grounded framework for individualized cortical characterization and reliable cross-subject correspondence.</description>

      <title>TreeLoc: 6-DoF LiDAR Global Localization in Forests via Inter-Tree Geometric Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable localization is crucial for navigation in forests, where GPS is often degraded and LiDAR measurements are repetitive, occluded, and structurally complex. These conditions weaken the assumptions of traditional urban-centric localization methods, which assume that consistent features arise from unique structural patterns, necessitating forest-centric solutions to achieve robustness in these environments. To address these challenges, we propose TreeLoc, a LiDAR-based global localization framework for forests that handles place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation. We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. We also propose applications for long-term forest management using descriptors from a compact global tree database. TreeLoc is open-sourced for the robotics community at https://github.com/minwoo0611/TreeLoc.</description>

      <title>MarkCleaner: High-Fidelity Watermark Removal via Imperceptible Micro-Geometric Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic watermarks exhibit strong robustness against conventional image-space attacks. In this work, we show that such robustness does not survive under micro-geometric perturbations: spatial displacements can remove watermarks by breaking the phase alignment. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MarkCleaner, a watermark removal framework that avoids semantic drift caused by regeneration-based watermark removal. Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>When Is Rank-1 Enough? Geometry-Guided Initialization for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a standard way to adapt multimodal large language models, yet extremely low-rank settings -- especially rank-1 LoRA -- are often unstable. We show that this instability is not solely due to limited capacity: in the rank-1 regime, optimization is highly sensitive to the update direction. Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant "gap" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself.</description>

      <title>Toward a Machine Bertin: Why Visualization Needs Design Principles for Machine Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualization's design knowledge-effectiveness rankings, encoding guidelines, color models, preattentive processing rules -- derives from six decades of psychophysical studies of human vision. Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a "machine Bertin" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving reliable and efficient planning in complex driving environments requires a model that can reason over the scene's geometry, appearance, and dynamics. We present UniDWM, a unified driving world model that advances autonomous driving through multifaceted representation learning. UniDWM constructs a structure- and dynamic-aware latent world representation that serves as a physically grounded state space, enabling consistent reasoning across perception, prediction, and planning. Specifically, a joint reconstruction pathway learns to recover the scene's structure, including geometry and visual texture, while a collaborative generation framework leverages a conditional diffusion transformer to forecast future world evolution within the latent space. Furthermore, we show that our UniDWM can be deemed as a variation of VAE, which provides theoretical guidance for the multifaceted representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniDWM in trajectory planning, 4D reconstruction and generation, highlighting the potential of multifaceted world representations as a foundation for unified driving intelligence. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Say2L/UniDWM.</description>

      <title>InfoTok: Regulating Information Flow for Capacity-Constrained Shared Visual Tokenization in Unified MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image understanding and generation in a single framework, with the visual tokenizer acting as the sole interface that maps visual inputs into tokens for downstream tasks. However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data. Experiments show consistent improvements on both understanding and generation, supporting information-regularized tokenization as a principled foundation for learning a shared token space in unified MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Generative Visual Code Mobile World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) World Models (WMs) offer a promising path for improving mobile GUI agent performance at train- and inference-time. However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Positioning With Lam\'e Curve LEDs: A Generic Approach for Camera Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) is a promising technique for accurate and low-cost indoor camera pose estimation (CPE). To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lam\'e curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lam\'e curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\textit{n}-points (FreeP\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error. Experiments further show that LC-VLP can achieve an average position accuracy of less than 4 cm.</description>

      <title>Genus-0 Surface Parameterization using Spherical Beltrami Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical surface parameterization is a fundamental tool in geometry processing and imaging science. For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior.</description>

      <title>From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Instrument Tray Assembly for Sterile Processing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) department is responsible for cleaning, disinfecting, inspecting, and assembling surgical instruments between surgeries. Manual inspection and preparation of instrument trays is a time-consuming, error-prone task, often prone to contamination and instrument breakage. In this work, we present a fully automated robotic system that sorts and structurally packs surgical instruments into sterile trays, focusing on automation of the SPD assembly stage. A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport. Experimental evaluations show high perception accuracy and statistically significant reduction in tool-to-tool collisions compared to human-assembled trays. This work serves as the scalable first step toward automating SPD workflows, improving safety, and consistency of surgical preparation while reducing SPD processing times.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Fusion with Spectral-Band and Fusion-Scale Agnosticism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current deep learning models for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MS/HS fusion) are typically designed for fixed spectral bands and spatial scales, which limits their transferability across diverse sensors. To address this, we propose SSA, a universal framework for MS/HS fusion with spectral-band and fusion-scale agnosticism. Specifically, we introduce Matryoshka Kernel (MK), a novel operator that enables a single model to adapt to arbitrary numbers of spectral channels. Meanwhile, we build SSA upon an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) backbone that models the HS signal as a continuous function, enabling reconstruction at arbitrary spatial resolutions. Together, these two forms of agnosticism enable a single MS/HS fusion model that generalizes effectively to unseen sensors and spatial scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our single model achieves state-of-the-art performance while generalizing well to unseen sensors and scales, paving the way toward future HS foundation models.</description>

      <title>MACD: Model-Aware Contrastive Decoding via Counterfactual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video language models (Video-LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, often generating plausible but ungrounded content when visual evidence is weak, ambiguous, or biased. Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Robot Perception with Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task problem solving has been shown to improve the accuracy of the individual tasks, which is an important feature for robots, as they have a limited resource. However, when the number of labels for each task is not equal, namely imbalanced data exist, a problem may arise due to insufficient number of samples, and labeling is not very easy for mobile robots in every environment. We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks. We investigate this by training the teacher network with the task outputs such as depth as inputs. We further provide empirical evidence when trained with a small amount of data. We use semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks on different datasets, NYUDv2 and Cityscapes.</description>

      <title>LIEREx: Language-Image Embeddings for Robotic Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic maps allow a robot to reason about its surroundings to fulfill tasks such as navigating known environments, finding specific objects, and exploring unmapped areas. Traditional mapping approaches provide accurate geometric representations but are often constrained by pre-designed symbolic vocabularies. The reliance on fixed object classes makes it impractical to handle out-of-distribution knowledge not defined at design time. Recent advances in Vision-Language Foundation Models, such as CLIP, enable open-set mapping, where objects are encoded as high-dimensional embeddings rather than fixed labels. In LIEREx, we integrate these VLFMs with established 3D Semantic Scene Graphs to enable target-directed exploration by an autonomous agent in partially unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Constrained Diffusion Models for Floorplan Generation: Balancing Realism and Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks.</description>

      <title>FlyPrompt: Brain-Inspired Random-Expanded Routing with Temporal-Ensemble Experts for General Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General continual learning (GCL) challenges intelligent systems to learn from single-pass, non-stationary data streams without clear task boundaries. While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

      <title>An Empirical Study of World Model Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models learn an internal representation of environment dynamics, enabling agents to simulate and reason about future states within a compact latent space for tasks such as planning, prediction, and inference. However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/QuantWM.</description>

      <title>FD-VLA: Force-Distilled Vision-Language-Action Model for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Force sensing is a crucial modality for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, as it enables fine-grained perception and dexterous manipulation in contact-rich tasks. We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor service robots need perception that is robust, more privacy-friendly than RGB video, and feasible on embedded hardware. We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance.</description>

      <title>Segment to Focus: Guiding Latent Action Models in the Presence of Distractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) learn to extract action-relevant representations solely from raw observations, enabling reinforcement learning from unlabelled videos and significantly scaling available training data. However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation.</description>

      <title>Why Steering Works: Toward a Unified View of Language Model Parameter Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/SPLIT.md.</description>

      <title>SoMA: A Real-to-Sim Neural Simulator for Robotic Soft-body Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating deformable objects under rich interactions remains a fundamental challenge for real-to-sim robot manipulation, with dynamics jointly driven by environmental effects and robot actions. Existing simulators rely on predefined physics or data-driven dynamics without robot-conditioned control, limiting accuracy, stability, and generalization. This paper presents SoMA, a 3D Gaussian Splat simulator for soft-body manipulation. SoMA couples deformable dynamics, environmental forces, and robot joint actions in a unified latent neural space for end-to-end real-to-sim simulation. Modeling interactions over learned Gaussian splats enables controllable, stable long-horizon manipulation and generalization beyond observed trajectories without predefined physical models. SoMA improves resimulation accuracy and generalization on real-world robot manipulation by 20%, enabling stable simulation of complex tasks such as long-horizon cloth folding.</description>

      <title>RANKVIDEO: Reasoning Reranking for Text-to-Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reranking is a critical component of modern retrieval systems, which typically pair an efficient first-stage retriever with a more expressive model to refine results. While large reasoning models have driven rapid progress in text-centric reranking, reasoning-based reranking for video retrieval remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce RANKVIDEO, a reasoning-based reranker for video retrieval that explicitly reasons over query-video pairs using video content to assess relevance. RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs. Experiments on the large-scale MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark demonstrate that RANKVIDEO consistently improves retrieval performance within a two-stage framework, yielding an average improvement of 31% on nDCG@10 and outperforming text-only and vision-language reranking alternatives, while more efficient.</description>

      <title>MentisOculi: Revealing the Limits of Reasoning with Mental Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier models are transitioning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that merely ingest visual information to unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of native interleaved generation. This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families.</description>

      <title>Towards Artwork Explanation in Large-scale Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) output text from images and instructions, demonstrating capabilities in text generation and comprehension. However, it has not been clarified to what extent LVLMs possess the ability to understand the knowledge necessary for explaining images, the complex relationships between various pieces of knowledge, and how they integrate these understandings into their explanations. To address this issue, we propose a new task: the artwork explanation generation task, along with its evaluation dataset and metrics for quantitatively assessing the understanding and utilization of knowledge about artworks. This task is apt for image description based on the premise that LVLMs are expected to have pre-existing knowledge of artworks, which are often subjects of wide recognition and documented information. It consists of two parts: generating explanations from images and titles of artworks, and generating explanations using only images, thus evaluating the LVLMs' language-based and vision-based knowledge. Alongside, we release a training dataset for LVLMs to learn explanations that incorporate knowledge about artworks. Our findings indicate that LVLMs not only struggle with integrating language and visual information but also exhibit a more pronounced limitation in acquiring knowledge from images alone.</description>

      <title>InterDreamer: Zero-Shot Text to 3D Dynamic Human-Object Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-conditioned human motion generation has experienced significant advancements with diffusion models trained on extensive motion capture data and corresponding textual annotations. However, extending such success to 3D dynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges, primarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive descriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the initiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions without direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in achieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. Being unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we instead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large language model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers high-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies of low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce a world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions influence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework, InterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot manner. We apply InterDreamer to the BEHAVE and CHAIRS datasets, and our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates its capability to generate realistic and coherent interaction sequences that seamlessly align with the text directives.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer Encoders for Mask2Former-style models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision transformer based models bring significant improvements for image segmentation tasks. Although these architectures offer powerful capabilities irrespective of specific segmentation tasks, their use of computational resources can be taxing on deployed devices. One way to overcome this challenge is by adapting the computation level to the specific needs of the input image rather than the current one-size-fits-all approach. To this end, we introduce ECO-M2F or EffiCient TransfOrmer Encoders for Mask2Former-style models. Noting that the encoder module of M2F-style models incur high resource-intensive computations, ECO-M2F provides a strategy to self-select the number of hidden layers in the encoder, conditioned on the input image. To enable this self-selection ability for providing a balance between performance and computational efficiency, we present a three step recipe. The first step is to train the parent architecture to enable early exiting from the encoder. The second step is to create an derived dataset of the ideal number of encoder layers required for each training example. The third step is to use the aforementioned derived dataset to train a gating network that predicts the number of encoder layers to be used, conditioned on the input image. Additionally, to change the computational-accuracy tradeoff, only steps two and three need to be repeated which significantly reduces retraining time. Experiments on the public datasets show that the proposed approach reduces expected encoder computational cost while maintaining performance, adapts to various user compute resources, is flexible in architecture configurations, and can be extended beyond the segmentation task to object detection.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</description>

      <title>Staircase Cascaded Fusion of Lightweight Local Pattern Recognition and Long-Range Dependencies for Structural Crack Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12815v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately segmenting structural cracks at the pixel level remains a major hurdle, as existing methods fail to integrate local textures with pixel dependencies, often leading to fragmented and incomplete predictions. Moreover, their high parameter counts and substantial computational demands hinder practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose CrackSCF, a Lightweight Cascaded Fusion Crack Segmentation Network designed to achieve robust crack segmentation with exceptional computational efficiency. We design a lightweight convolutional block (LRDS) to replace all standard convolutions. This approach efficiently captures local patterns while operating with a minimal computational footprint. For a holistic perception of crack structures, a lightweight Long-range Dependency Extractor (LDE) captures global dependencies. These are then intelligently unified with local patterns by our Staircase Cascaded Fusion Module (SCFM), ensuring the final segmentation maps are both seamless in continuity and rich in fine-grained detail. To comprehensively evaluate our method, this paper created the challenging TUT benchmark dataset and evaluated it alongside five other public datasets. The experimental results show that the CrackSCF method consistently outperforms the existing methods, and it demonstrates greater robustness in dealing with complex background noise. On the TUT dataset, CrackSCF achieved 0.8382 on F1 score and 0.8473 on mIoU, and it only required 4.79M parameters.</description>

Abstract: Multi-camera tracking plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</description>

      <title>EgoFSD: Ego-Centric Fully Sparse Paradigm with Uncertainty Denoising and Iterative Refinement for Efficient End-to-End Self-Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09777v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) methods resort to unifying modular designs for various tasks (e.g. perception, prediction and planning). Although optimized with a fully differentiable framework in a planning-oriented manner, existing end-to-end driving systems lacking ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, due to rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named EgoFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, EgoFSD consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. In addition, position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thereby enhancing the training stability and convergence speed. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets, which significantly reduces the average L2 error by 59% and collision rate by 92% than UniAD while achieves 6.9x faster running efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</description>

Abstract: Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based methods provide a good alternative approach by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face a key dilemma: improving the reconstruction power of the generative model while keeping a compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. By distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noise and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

      <title>Edge Weight Prediction For Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) localizes keypoints across diverse object categories with a single model, using one or a few annotated support images. Recent works have shown that using a pose graph (i.e., treating keypoints as nodes in a graph rather than isolated points) helps handle occlusions and break symmetry. However, these methods assume a static pose graph with equal-weight edges, leading to suboptimal results. We introduce EdgeCape, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by predicting the graph's edge weights which optimizes localization. To further leverage structural priors, we propose integrating Markovian Structural Bias, which modulates the self-attention interaction between nodes based on the number of hops between them. We show that this improves the model's ability to capture global spatial dependencies. Evaluated on the MP-100 benchmark, which includes 100 categories and over 20K images, EdgeCape achieves state-of-the-art results in the 1-shot setting and leads among similar-sized methods in the 5-shot setting, significantly improving keypoint localization accuracy. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Feat2GS: Probing Visual Foundation Models with Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}$, $\alpha$, $\Sigma$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data are available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/.</description>

      <title>Semantically Guided Dynamic Visual Prototype Refinement for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) seeks to recognize unseen state-object pairs by recombining primitives learned from seen compositions. Despite recent progress with vision-language models (VLMs), two limitations remain: (i) text-driven semantic prototypes are weakly discriminative in the visual feature space; and (ii) unseen pairs are optimized passively, thereby inducing seen bias. To address these limitations, we present Duplex, a framework that couples dual-prototype learning with dynamic local-graph refinement of visual prototypes. For each composition, Duplex maintains a semantic prototype via prompt learning and a visual prototype for unseen pairs constructed by recombining disentangled state and object primitives from seen images. The visual prototypes are updated dynamically through lightweight aggregation on mini-batch local graphs, which incorporates unseen compositions during training without labels. This design introduces fine-grained visual evidence while preserving semantic structure. It enriches class prototypes, better disambiguates semantically similar yet visually distinct pairs, and mitigates seen bias. Experiments on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and CGQA in closed-world and open-world settings achieve competitive performance and consistent compositional generalization.

      <title>3D Dynamics-Aware Manipulation: Endowing Manipulation Policies with 3D Foresight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incorporation of world modeling into manipulation policy learning has pushed the boundary of manipulation performance. However, existing efforts simply model the 2D visual dynamics, which is insufficient for robust manipulation when target tasks involve prominent depth-wise movement. To address this, we present a 3D dynamics-aware manipulation framework that seamlessly integrates 3D world modeling and policy learning. Three self-supervised learning tasks (current depth estimation, future RGB-D prediction, 3D flow prediction) are introduced within our framework, which complement each other and endow the policy model with 3D foresight. Extensive experiments on simulation and the real world show that 3D foresight can greatly boost the performance of manipulation policies without sacrificing inference speed.

      <description>arXiv:2502.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Driving World Model (DWM), which focuses on predicting scene evolution during the driving process, has emerged as a promising paradigm in the pursuit of autonomous driving (AD). DWMs enable AD systems to better perceive, understand, and interact with dynamic driving environments. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in DWM. First, we review the DWM ecosystem, which is constructed using mainstream simulators, high-impact datasets, and various metrics that evaluate DWMs across multiple dimensions. We then categorize existing approaches based on the modalities of the predicted scenes, including video, point cloud, occupancy, latent feature, and traffic map, and summarize their specific applications in AD research. In addition, the performance of representative approaches across generating and driving tasks is presented. Finally, we discuss the potential limitations of current research and propose future directions. This survey provides valuable insights into the development and application of DWM, fostering its broader adoption in AD. The relevant papers are collected at https://github.com/LMD0311/Awesome-World-Model.</description>

      <title>InterMimic: Towards Universal Whole-Body Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving realistic simulations of humans interacting with a wide range of objects has long been a fundamental goal. Extending physics-based motion imitation to complex human-object interactions (HOIs) is challenging due to intricate human-object coupling, variability in object geometries, and artifacts in motion capture data, such as inaccurate contacts and limited hand detail. We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets. The learned policy generalizes in a zero-shot manner and seamlessly integrates with kinematic generators, elevating the framework from mere imitation to generative modeling of complex human-object interactions.</description>

      <title>SuperCarver: Texture-Consistent 3D Geometry Super-Resolution for High-Fidelity Surface Detail Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional production workflow of high-precision mesh assets necessitates a cumbersome and laborious process of manual sculpting by specialized 3D artists/modelers. The recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in AI-empowered 3D content creation for generating plausible structures and intricate appearances from images or text prompts. However, synthesizing realistic surface details still poses great challenges, and enhancing the geometry fidelity of existing lower-quality 3D meshes (instead of image/text-to-3D generation) remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution pipeline for supplementing texture-consistent surface details onto a given coarse mesh. We start by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from multiple viewpoints. To achieve detail boosting, we construct a deterministic prior-guided normal diffusion model, which is fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of paired detail-lacking and detail-rich normal map renderings. To update mesh surfaces from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we design a noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme through deformable distance field. Experiments demonstrate that our SuperCarver is capable of generating realistic and expressive surface details depicted by the actual texture appearance, making it a powerful tool to both upgrade historical low-quality 3D assets and reduce the workload of sculpting high-poly meshes.</description>

      <title>DenseFormer: Learning Dense Depth Map from Sparse Depth and Image via Conditional Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The depth completion task is a critical problem in autonomous driving, involving the generation of dense depth maps from sparse depth maps and RGB images. Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The current approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign language videos through pose information into English-based ID Glosses, which serve to uniquely identify ASL signs. This paper proposes SignX, a novel framework for continuous sign language recognition in compact pose-rich latent space. First, we construct a unified latent representation that encodes heterogeneous pose formats (SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens Segmentation) into a compact, information-dense space. Second, we train a ViT-based Video2Pose module to extract this latent representation directly from raw videos. Finally, we develop a temporal modeling and sequence refinement method that operates entirely in this latent space. This multi-stage design achieves end-to-end sign language recognition while significantly reducing computational consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that SignX achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on continuous sign language recognition.</description>

Abstract: Face recognition performance based on deep learning heavily relies on large-scale training data, which is often difficult to acquire in practical applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a GAN-based data augmentation method with three key contributions: (1) a residual-embedded generator to alleviate gradient vanishing/exploding problems, (2) an Inception ResNet-V1 based FaceNet discriminator for improved adversarial training, and (3) an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes data generation and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves stable training dynamics and significantly improves face recognition accuracy by 12.7% on the LFW benchmark compared to baseline methods, while maintaining good generalization capability with limited training samples.</description>

      <title>MVAR: Visual Autoregressive Modeling with Scale and Spatial Markovian Conditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors. Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Pose Splatter: A 3D Gaussian Splatting Model for Quantifying Animal Pose and Appearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint- and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose a rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably, Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans, and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale, longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and behavior at high resolutions.</description>

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, aiming at generating a mask sequence from an input video given a complex and implicit text query. While existing works finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for the task, they still fail in video inputs given complex temporally-sensitive queries, indicating their lack of temporal and spatial integration in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose CoT-RVS, a novel framework employing the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these complex challenges by temporal-semantic reasoning: CoT-RVS analyzes the visible objects within a given frame that possibly match the language query (semantic), and chooses a corresponding keyframe for each object that can be observed effortlessly among all frames (temporal). Notably, the CoT-RVS framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. Our framework's training-free feature further allows its extension to process online video streams, where the CoT is used at test time to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that CoT-RVS significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>ConsiStyle: Style Diversity in Training-Free Consistent T2I Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In text-to-image models, consistent character generation is the task of achieving text alignment while maintaining the subject's appearance across different prompts. However, since style and appearance are often entangled, the existing methods struggle to preserve consistent subject characteristics while adhering to varying style prompts. Current approaches for consistent text-to-image generation typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning on curated image sets or per-subject optimization, which either fail to generalize across prompts or do not align well with textual descriptions. Meanwhile, training-free methods often fail to maintain subject consistency across different styles. In this work, we introduce a training-free method that, for the first time, jointly achieves style preservation and subject consistency across varied styles. The attention matrices are manipulated such that Queries and Keys are obtained from the anchor image(s) that are used to define the subject, while the Values are imported from a parallel copy that is not subject-anchored. Additionally, cross-image components are added to the self-attention mechanism by expanding the Key and Value matrices. To do without shifting from the target style, we align the statistics of the Value matrices. As is demonstrated in a comprehensive battery of qualitative and quantitative experiments, our method effectively decouples style from subject appearance and enables faithful generation of text-aligned images with consistent characters across diverse styles.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation of Attention Heads for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables anomaly detection without normal samples from target categories, addressing scenarios where task-specific training data is unavailable. However, existing ZSAD methods either neglect adaptation of vision-language models to anomaly detection or implement only partial adaptation. This paper proposes Head-adaptive CLIP (HeadCLIP), which effectively adapts both text and image encoders. HeadCLIP employs learnable prompts in the text encoder to generalize normality and abnormality concepts, and introduces learnable head weights in the image encoder to dynamically adjust attention head features for task-specific adaptation. A joint anomaly score is further proposed to leverage adapted pixel-level information for enhanced image-level detection. Experiments on 17 datasets across industrial and medical domains demonstrate that HeadCLIP outperforms existing ZSAD methods at both pixel and image levels, achieving improvements of up to 4.9\%p in pixel-level mean anomaly detection score (mAD) and 3.7%p in image-level mAD in the industrial domain, with comparable gains (3.2%p, 3.2%p) in the medical domain. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/kiyoonjeong0305/HeadCLIP.</description>

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world, including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset, containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality. Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism.</description>

      <title>PointT2I: LLM-based text-to-image generation via keypoints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements, resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM). PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation, and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt, without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual prompts.</description>

      <title>HueManity: Probing Fine-Grained Visual Perception in MLLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03194v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong high-level visual reasoning on tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet existing benchmarks largely overlook their ability to capture fine-grained perceptual details. As MLLMs are increasingly deployed in safety and reliability critical settings, perceptual acuity becomes essential. We present HueManity, a scalable automated benchmark for assessing fine-grained visual perception in MLLMs. HueManity comprises 83,850 Ishihara-style images embedding alphanumeric strings, designed to evaluate pattern recognition, a core aspect of visual understanding. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs uncovers a striking performance deficit: the strongest model achieved only 33.6% accuracy on a simple numeric task and 3% on a harder alphanumeric task, compared to near-ceiling performance from humans (99.38%, 93.25%) and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 (96.5%, 94.5%). These findings expose a critical weakness in MLLMs' perceptual grounding, one that remains obscured by conventional benchmarks emphasizing high-level semantics.</description>

      <title>NAP-Tuning: Neural Augmented Prompt Tuning for Adversarially Robust Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.</description>

      <title>HalluRNN: Mitigating Hallucinations via Recurrent Cross-Layer Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they are still prone to hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>What does really matter in image goal navigation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image. Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In this large experimental study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extent. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection, non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA) fully-supervised ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</description>

      <title>Transferring Visual Explainability of Self-Explaining Models to Prediction-Only Models without Additional Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In image classification scenarios where both prediction and explanation efficiency are required, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single inference are effective. However, for users who already have prediction-only models, training a new self-explaining model from scratch imposes significant costs in terms of both labeling and computation. This study proposes a method to transfer the visual explanation capability of self-explaining models learned in a source domain to prediction-only models in a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework. Our self-explaining model comprises an architecture that extends Vision Transformer-based prediction-only models, enabling the proposed method to endow explanation capability to many trained prediction-only models without additional training. Experiments on various image classification datasets demonstrate that, except for transfers between less-related domains, the transfer of visual explanation capability from source to target domains is successful, and explanation quality in the target domain improves without substantially sacrificing classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>OpenWorldSAM: Extending SAM2 for Universal Image Segmentation with Language Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to segment objects based on open-ended language prompts remains a critical challenge, requiring models to ground textual semantics into precise spatial masks while handling diverse and unseen categories. We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks.

      <title>SpatialViz-Bench: A Cognitively-Grounded Benchmark for Diagnosing Spatial Visualization in MLLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07610v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can imagine and manipulate visual images mentally, a capability known as spatial visualization. While many multi-modal benchmarks assess reasoning on visible visual information, the ability to infer unseen relationships through spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated as a spatial skill. This reliance on publicly sourced problems from IQ tests or math competitions risks data contamination and compromises assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 programmatically generated problems, a scalable framework that allows for expansion to ensure fair and continuously reliable evaluations. Our evaluation of 27 Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals wide performance variations, demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, and uncovers counter-intuitive findings: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting paradoxically degrades accuracy on open-source models. Through statistical and qualitative analysis of error types, SpatialViz-Bench demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark data and evaluation code are publicly available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics.

      <description>arXiv:2507.16403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new dataset, ReasonVQA, for the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our dataset is automatically integrated with structured encyclopedic knowledge and constructed using a low-cost framework, which is capable of generating complex, multi-hop questions. We evaluated state-of-the-art VQA models on ReasonVQA, and the empirical results demonstrate that ReasonVQA poses significant challenges to these models, highlighting its potential for benchmarking and advancing the field of VQA. Additionally, our dataset can be easily scaled with respect to input images; the current version surpasses the largest existing datasets requiring external knowledge by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Token Compression for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20198v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.</description>

      <title>DA-Occ: Direction-Aware 2D Convolution for Efficient and Geometry-Preserving 3D Occupancy Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is vital for the performance of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods struggle to balance precision and efficiency: high-accuracy approaches are often hindered by heavy computational overhead, leading to slow inference speeds, while others leverage pure bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations to gain speed at the cost of losing vertical spatial cues and compromising geometric integrity. To overcome these limitations, we build on the efficient Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm and propose a pure 2D framework, DA-Occ, for 3D occupancy prediction that preserves fine-grained geometry. Standard LSS-based methods lift 2D features into 3D space solely based on depth scores, making it difficult to fully capture vertical structure. To improve upon this, DA-Occ augments depth-based lifting with a complementary height-score projection that explicitly encodes vertical geometric information. We further employ direction-aware convolution to extract geometric features along both vertical and horizontal orientations, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>An Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Data Reconstruction (1986-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Current extended VIIRS-like NTL data products suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the omission of structural details. To overcome these limitations, we present the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) dataset, a new annual NTL dataset for China spanning from 1986 to 2024. This dataset was generated using a novel two-stage deep learning model designed to address the aforementioned shortcomings. The model first constructs an initial estimate and subsequently refines fine-grained structural details using high-resolution impervious surface data as guidance. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that EVAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art products, exhibiting superior temporal consistency and a stronger correlation with socioeconomic indicators.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Intervention Representations with Delta Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs (also called ``actionable counterfactuals'' in the literature), have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of actionable counterfactuals in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a method for learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.</description>

      <title>VQAThinker: Exploring Generalizable and Explainable Video Quality Assessment via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations: \textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and \textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making. Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a \textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth; (2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring. Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.</description>

      <title>Beyond Global Scanning: Adaptive Visual State Space Modeling for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive state space context network (ASCNet), which builds upon the state space model mechanism to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a Multi-Level Context Module (MLCM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception, allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the APVSS block as the decoder of ASCNet. This module integrates our proposed Dynamic Adaptive Granularity Scan (DAGS) and Granularity-aware Propagation Module (GPM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps enhanced by local perception, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing state space model's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>Hospital-Specific Bias in Patch-Based Pathology Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) achieve strong performance on diverse histopathology tasks, but their sensitivity to hospital-specific domain shifts remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art PFMs on TCGA patch-level datasets and introduce a lightweight adversarial adaptor to remove hospital-related domain information from latent representations. Experiments show that, while disease classification accuracy is largely maintained, the adaptor effectively reduces hospital-specific bias, as confirmed by t-SNE visualizations. Our study establishes a benchmark for assessing cross-hospital robustness in PFMs and provides a practical strategy for enhancing generalization under heterogeneous clinical settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/MengRes/pfm_domain_bias.</description>

      <title>Virtual Community: An Open World for Humans, Robots, and Society</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to enable the study of embodied social intelligence at scale. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer sampling steps to reach strong performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Loss Functions for Inference-Time Optimization in Text-to-Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these objectives directly from the model's internal representations.
  We introduce Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces in the cross-attention maps, rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this by augmenting our training data with samples generated using prompts with incorrect relation words, which encourages the classifier to avoid linguistic shortcuts and learn spatial patterns from the attention maps. Our method dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 20% to 61% on FLUX.1-dev and from 7% to 54% on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. It also generalizes to multiple relations with significantly improved accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets, high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</description>

      <title>GLEAM: Learning to Match and Explain in Cross-View Geo-Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they only determine whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework improves training efficiency through optimized implementation and achieves accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models via a novel two-phase training strategy. To address interpretability, we further propose GLEAM-X, a novel task that combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning enabled by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We construct a bilingual benchmark using commercial MLLMs to generate training and testing data, and refine the test set through rigorous human revision for systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/GLEAM.</description>

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments on 17 text-to-image and unified models demonstrate the great challenge of GenExam and the huge gap where open-source models consistently lag behind the leading closed-source ones. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate understanding, reasoning, and generation, providing insights for on the path to intelligent generative models. Our benchmark and evaluation code are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/GenExam.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Detection of Tiny Objects in Aerial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While one-stage detectors like YOLOv8 offer fast training speed, they often under-perform on detecting small objects as a trade-off. This becomes even more critical when detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to low-resolution targets and cluttered backgrounds.
  To address this, we introduce four enhancement strategies-input image resolution adjustment, data augmentation, attention mechanisms, and an alternative gating function for attention modules-that can be easily implemented on YOLOv8. We demonstrate that image size enlargement and the proper use of augmentation can lead to enhancement. Additionally, we designed a Mixture of Orthogonal Neural-modules Network (MoonNet) pipeline which consists of multiple attention-module-augmented CNNs. Two well-known attention modules, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Block and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), were integrated into the backbone of YOLOv8 to form the MoonNet design, and the MoonNet backbone obtained improved detection accuracy compared to the original YOLOv8 backbone and single-type attention-module-augmented backbones. MoonNet further proved its adaptability and potential by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a tiny-object benchmark when integrated with the YOLC model.

      <title>MoCrop: Training Free Motion Guided Cropping for Efficient Video Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard video action recognition models often process typically resized full frames, suffering from spatial redundancy and high computational costs. To address this, we introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module designed for efficient video action recognition in the compressed domain. Leveraging Motion Vectors (MVs) naturally available in H.264 video, MoCrop localizes motion-dense regions to produce adaptive crops at inference without requiring any training or parameter updates. Our lightweight pipeline synergizes three key components: Merge &amp; Denoise (MD) for outlier filtering, Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS) for efficient importance sampling, and Motion Grid Search (MGS) for optimal region localization. This design allows MoCrop to serve as a versatile "plug-and-play" module for diverse backbones. Extensive experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that MoCrop serves as both an accelerator and an enhancer. With ResNet-50, it achieves a +3.5% boost in Top-1 accuracy at equivalent FLOPs (Attention Setting), or a +2.4% accuracy gain with 26.5% fewer FLOPs (Efficiency Setting). When applied to CoViAR, it improves accuracy to 89.2% or reduces computation by roughly 27% (from 11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs). Consistent gains across MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B confirm its strong generality and suitability for real-time deployment. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCrop.</description>

      <title>Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation: A Closer Look for Fair and Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures. Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation research.</description>

      <title>FAST: Foreground-aware Diffusion with Accelerated Sampling Trajectory for Segmentation-oriented Anomaly Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations, yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label. Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step, preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream segmentation tasks. We release the code at: https://github.com/Chhro123/fast-foreground-aware-anomaly-synthesis.</description>

      <title>Towards Faithful Reasoning in Remote Sensing: A Perceptually-Grounded GeoSpatial Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model, RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks. The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.</description>

      <title>Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation by earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Unified Representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the learning of 3DGS.

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation for Pretrained Medical Image Registration Models via Transformation Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential in many medical imaging applications, yet most deep registration networks provide little indication of when or where their predictions are unreliable. Existing uncertainty estimation approaches, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC-dropout, typically require architectural modifications or retraining, precluding their applicability to pretrained registration models. We propose an inference-time, model-agnostic uncertainty estimation framework that applies directly to any pretrained registration network. Our approach is grounded in the transformation equivariance property of image registration, which states that the underlying anatomical mapping should remain consistent under spatial perturbations of the input. Experiments across three pretrained registration models and four anatomical structures show that the resulting uncertainty maps consistently correlate with registration error and highlight unreliably aligned regions. This framework turns pretrained registration networks into risk-aware tools at test time, moving medical image registration closer to safe clinical and large-scale research deployment.</description>

      <title>DiffInk: Glyph- and Style-Aware Latent Diffusion Transformer for Text to Online Handwriting Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation (TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled. We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while significantly improving generation efficiency.</description>

      <title>EditScore: Unlocking Online RL for Image Editing via High-Fidelity Reward Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain.</description>

Abstract: We present HunyuanImage 3.0, a native multimodal model that unifies multimodal understanding and generation within an autoregressive framework, with its image generation module publicly available. The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, a native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem.

      <title>Toward a Vision-Language Foundation Model for Medical Data: Multimodal Dataset and Benchmarks for Vietnamese PET/CT Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset consisting of 2,757 whole-body PET/CT volumes from independent patients and their corresponding full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, especially for low-resource languages and clinical use in Vietnamese healthcare.

      <title>GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</description>

      <title>Point2RBox-v3: Self-Bootstrapping from Point Annotations via Integrated Pseudo-Label Refinement and Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.</description>

      <title>Scaling Sequence-to-Sequence Generative Neural Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task. Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to: i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii) generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric Representation Learning for Enhanced 3D Scene Graph Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.</description>

      <title>HOI-R1: Exploring the Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models for Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. Experiments on HICO-DET across multiple open-source MLLMs, including the Qwen-VL family (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL) and Rex-Omni, show consistent improvements. Especially, HOI-R1 boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B 2$\times$ accuracy with great generalization ability. The source code is available at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.</description>

      <title>iPEAR: Iterative Pyramid Estimation with Attention and Residuals for Deformable Medical Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing pyramid registration networks may accumulate anatomical misalignments and lack an effective mechanism to dynamically determine the number of optimization iterations under varying deformation requirements across images, leading to degraded performance. To solve these limitations, we propose iPEAR. Specifically, iPEAR adopts our proposed Fused Attention-Residual Module (FARM) for decoding, which comprises an attention pathway and a residual pathway to alleviate the accumulation of anatomical misalignment. We further propose a dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy that adaptively determines the number of optimization iterations for varying images by evaluating registration stability and convergence. Extensive experiments on three public brain MRI datasets and one public abdomen CT dataset show that iPEAR outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of accuracy, while achieving on-par inference speed and model parameter size. Generalization and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed FARM and TCI.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Meets Masked Generative Models: Mask-GRPO for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

      <title>UniCalli: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Column-Level Generation and Recognition of Chinese Calligraphy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging. Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in \href{https://github.com/EnVision-Research/UniCalli}{this URL}.</description>

      <title>DOS: Directional Object Separation in Text Embeddings for Multi-Object Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks. These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation.</description>

      <title>UrbanIng-V2X: A Large-Scale Multi-Vehicle, Multi-Infrastructure Dataset Across Multiple Intersections for Cooperative Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2</description>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world interaction. Despite their remarkable performance, foundational VLAs are hindered by the prohibitive computational and data demands inherent to their large-scale architectures. While a surge of recent research has focused on enhancing VLA efficiency, the field lacks a unified framework to consolidate these disparate advancements. To bridge this gap, this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire model-training-data pipeline. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design, focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3) Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications, delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments: https://evla-survey.github.io/.</description>

      <title>T-MLA: A targeted multiscale log-exponential attack framework for neural image compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural image compression (NIC) has become the state-of-the-art for rate-distortion performance, yet its security vulnerabilities remain significantly less understood than those of classifiers. Existing adversarial attacks on NICs are often naive adaptations of pixel-space methods, overlooking the unique, structured nature of the compression pipeline. In this work, we propose a more advanced class of vulnerabilities by introducing T-MLA, the first targeted multiscale log-exponential attack framework. We introduce adversarial perturbations in the wavelet domain that concentrate on less perceptually salient coefficients, improving the stealth of the attack. Extensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art NIC architectures on standard image compression benchmarks reveals a large drop in reconstruction quality while the perturbations remain visually imperceptible. On standard NIC benchmarks, T-MLA achieves targeted degradation of reconstruction quality while improving perturbation imperceptibility (higher PSNR/VIF of the perturbed inputs) compared to PGD-style baselines at comparable attack success, as summarized in our main results. Our findings reveal a critical security flaw at the core of generative and content delivery pipelines.</description>

Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the SciTextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,270 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the deep connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Built through an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects, implements, and standardizes scientific and generative models. This AI pipeline is also used to autonomously invent and implement novel methods for generating visual patterns and textures. SciTextures enables systematic evaluation of vision language models (VLM's) ability to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerge from the same underlying process. We also test VLMs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world phenomenon and asking the AI to identify and code a model of the process that formed it, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the reference image. These benchmarks reveal that VLM's can understand and simulate physical systems beyond visual patterns at multiple levels of abstraction.

      <title>Beyond Cosine Similarity: Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</description>

      <title>Learnable Total Variation with Lambda Mapping for Low-Dose CT Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Total Variation (TV) excels in noise reduction and edge preservation, its reliance on a scalar regularization parameter limits adaptivity. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework coupling an unrolled TV solver with a LambdaNet that predicts a per-pixel regularization map. The proposed framework is trained end-to-end to optimize reconstruction and regularization jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using realistic LoDoPaB-CT simulation, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net, achieving up to +3.7 dB PSNR and 8% relative SSIM improvement. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs for low-dose CT denoising.</description>

      <title>NP-LoRA: Null Space Projection Unifies Subject and Style in LoRA Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion enables the composition of learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging within a shared adaptation space, where independently trained LoRAs interfere and degrade fidelity. We show that this interference is fundamentally geometric: content and style LoRAs occupy overlapping, non-orthogonal low-rank subspaces, making weight-based fusion inherently flawed. Analyzing LoRA internal structure, we find that generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions that must be preserved during fusion. Based on this insight, we reformulate LoRA fusion as a null-space projection problem and propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework that enforces subspace separation by construction. NP-LoRA extracts principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and projects the subject LoRA into the orthogonal complement of the style subspace, preventing interference. We further introduce a soft projection mechanism that provides continuous control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style preservation. Experiments show that NP-LoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes well across pretrained LoRA pairs without retraining.</description>

      <title>A Space-Time Transformer for Precipitation Nowcasting</title>

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue life-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose \textbf{SaTformer}: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored \textbf{first place} on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 ``Cumulative Rainfall'' challenge.

      <title>Robust Low-Rank Sparse Framework for Video-Based Affective Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.</description>

      <title>ImAgent: A Unified Multimodal Agent Framework for Test-Time Scalable Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.</description>

Abstract: Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.</description>

      <title>GEO-Bench-2: From Performance to Capability, Rethinking Evaluation in Geospatial AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.
  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, though with dataset-dependent trade-offs in precision. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Video Deraining with Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.</description>

      <title>SocialFusion: Addressing Social Degradation in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unrolled networks have been widely used for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction due to their efficiency. However, they typically exhibit unstable output quality across cascades, resulting in sub-optimal final reconstruction results. In this work, we address this inherent limitation of unrolled networks, drawing inspiration from recent Flow Matching paradigm. We first theoretically prove that unrolled networks are discretizations of conditional probability flows. This connection shows that unrolled networks and Flow Matching are analogous in MRI reconstruction. Building upon this insight, we propose FLow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which (1) derives important cascade parameters from the Flow Matching discretization; and (2) aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal Flow Matching trajectory to improve cascade iteration stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT results in a stable trajectory across sub-networks, improving the quality of the final reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Stable Signer: Hierarchical Sign Language Generative Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the process of converting the complex input text into a real video. Most previous works focused on the Text2Gloss, Gloss2Pose, Pose2Vid stages, and some concentrated on Prompt2Gloss and Text2Avatar stages. However, this field has made slow progress due to the inaccuracy of text conversion, pose generation, and the rendering of poses into real human videos in these stages, resulting in gradually accumulating errors. Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods.</description>

      <title>Inference-time Stochastic Refinement of GRU-Normalizing Flow for Real-time Video Motion Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time video motion transfer applications such as immersive gaming and vision-based anomaly detection require accurate yet diverse future predictions to support realistic synthesis and robust downstream decision making under uncertainty. To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively. These results highlight the potential of integrating stochastic dynamics with flow-based sequence models for generative time series forecasting.

      <title>GuidNoise: Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for Generalized Noise Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

      <title>SCAIL: Towards Studio-Grade Character Animation via In-Context Learning of 3D-Consistent Pose Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving character animation that meets studio-grade production standards remains challenging despite recent progress. Existing approaches can transfer motion from a driving video to a reference image, but often fail to preserve structural fidelity and temporal consistency in wild scenarios involving complex motion and cross-identity animations. In this work, we present \textbf{SCAIL} (a framework toward \textbf{S}tudio-grade \textbf{C}haracter \textbf{A}nimation via \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning), a framework designed to address these challenges from two key innovations. First, we propose a novel 3D pose representation, providing a more robust and flexible motion signal. Second, we introduce a full-context pose injection mechanism within a diffusion-transformer architecture, enabling effective spatio-temporal reasoning over full motion sequences. To align with studio-level requirements, we develop a curated data pipeline ensuring both diversity and quality, and establish a comprehensive benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that \textbf{SCAIL} achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances character animation toward studio-grade reliability and realism.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Universal Deepfake Detection with Frequency-Domain Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

      <title>VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.</description>

      <title>Robust MLLM Unlearning via Visual Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.</description>

      <title>SCR2-ST: Combine Single Cell with Spatial Transcriptomics for Efficient Active Sampling via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

      <title>Beyond Vision: Contextually Enriched Image Captioning with Multi-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding</description>

      <title>SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.</description>

      <title>Resolving compositional and conformational heterogeneity in cryo-EM with deformable 3D Gaussian representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for studying protein function. Although cryogenic electron microscopy(cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to observe macromolecular dynamics directly, computational analysis of datasets mixing continuous and discrete structural states remains a formidable challenge. Here we introduce GaussianEM, a Gaussian-based pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously resolves compositional and conformational heterogeneity from cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a dual-encoder-single-decoder architecture to decompose images into learnable Gaussian components, with variability encoded through modulated parameters. This explicit parameterization yields a continuous, intuitive representation of conformational dynamics that inherently preserves local structural integrity. By modeling displacements in Gaussian space, we capture atomic-scale conformational landscapes, bridging density maps and all-atom models. In comprehensive experiments, GaussianEM successfully reconstructs complex compositional and conformational variability,and resolves previously unobserved details in public datasets. Quantitative evaluations further confirm its ability to capture broader conformational diversity without sacrificing structural fidelity.</description>

      <title>DyStream: Streaming Dyadic Talking Heads Generation via Flow Matching-based Autoregressive Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.</description>

      <title>PhyGDPO: Physics-Aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization for Physically Consistent Text-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2. Please check our project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/PhyGDPO for more video results.

      <title>FaithSCAN: Model-Driven Single-Pass Hallucination Detection for Faithful Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Demosaicing with Spatially Downsampled Isotropic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.</description>

      <title>TP-Blend: Textual-Prompt Attention Pairing for Precise Object-Style Blending in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current text-conditioned diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when a new object and a new style must be introduced simultaneously. We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.</description>

      <title>UM-Text: A Unified Multimodal Model for Image Understanding and Visual Text Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>VibrantSR: Sub-Meter Canopy Height Models from Sentinel-2 Using Generative Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights &gt;= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.</description>

      <title>DR$^2$Seg: Decomposed Two-Stage Rollouts for Efficient Reasoning Segmentation in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to mitigate overthinking and the associated attention dispersion. Extensive experiments conducted on 3B and 7B variants of Qwen2.5-VL, as well as on both SAM2 and SAM3, demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.
  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Infrastructure Inspections: A Literature Review and Proposed Framework for AEC+FM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are transforming infrastructure inspections in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management (AEC+FM) domain. By synthesizing insights from over 150 studies, this review paper highlights UAV-based methodologies for data acquisition, photogrammetric modeling, defect detection, and decision-making support. Key innovations include path optimization, thermal integration, and advanced machine learning (ML) models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN for anomaly detection. UAVs have demonstrated value in structural health monitoring (SHM), disaster response, urban infrastructure management, energy efficiency evaluations, and cultural heritage preservation. Despite these advancements, challenges in real-time processing, multimodal data fusion, and generalizability remain. A proposed workflow framework, informed by literature and a case study, integrates RGB imagery, LiDAR, and thermal sensing with transformer-based architectures to improve accuracy and reliability in detecting structural defects, thermal anomalies, and geometric inconsistencies. The proposed framework ensures precise and actionable insights by fusing multimodal data and dynamically adapting path planning for complex environments, presented as a comprehensive step-by-step guide to address these challenges effectively. This paper concludes with future research directions emphasizing lightweight AI models, adaptive flight planning, synthetic datasets, and richer modality fusion to streamline modern infrastructure inspections.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our mixed precision models offer less latency by up to 2.538 times compared to FP32 models.</description>

      <title>Seeing through Light and Darkness: Sensor-Physics Grounded Deblurring HDR NeRF from Single-Exposure Images and Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.</description>

      <title>Model-Centric Diagnostics: A Framework for Internal State Readouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model-centric diagnostic framework that treats training state as a latent variable and unifies a family of internal readouts -- head-gradient norms, confidence, entropy, margin, and related signals -- as anchor-relative projections of that state. A preliminary version of this work introduced a head-gradient probe for checkpoint selection. In this version, we focus on the unifying perspective and structural diagnostics; full algorithmic details, theoretical analysis, and experimental validation will appear in a forthcoming paper.
  We outline the conceptual scaffold: any prediction head induces a local loss landscape whose geometry (gradient magnitude, curvature, sharpness) reflects how well the upstream features are aligned with the task. Different readout choices -- gradient norms, softmax entropy, predictive margin -- correspond to different projections of this geometry, each with complementary strengths. The framework suggests that checkpoint selection, early stopping, and lightweight architecture pre-screening can all be viewed as querying the same underlying state through different lenses.
  Illustrative experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO detection/segmentation hint at the practical potential; rigorous benchmarks and ablations are deferred to the full paper.</description>

      <title>PhaSR: Generalized Image Shadow Removal with Physically Aligned Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadow removal under diverse lighting conditions requires disentangling illumination from intrinsic reflectance, a challenge compounded when physical priors are not properly aligned. We propose PhaSR (Physically Aligned Shadow Removal), addressing this through dual-level prior alignment to enable robust performance from single-light shadows to multi-source ambient lighting. First, Physically Aligned Normalization (PAN) performs closed-form illumination correction via Gray-world normalization, log-domain Retinex decomposition, and dynamic range recombination, suppressing chromatic bias. Second, Geometric-Semantic Rectification Attention (GSRA) extends differential attention to cross-modal alignment, harmonizing depth-derived geometry with DINO-v2 semantic embeddings to resolve modal conflicts under varying illumination. Experiments show competitive performance in shadow removal with lower complexity and generalization to ambient lighting where traditional methods fail under multi-source illumination.

      <title>Adaptive Domain Shift in Diffusion Models for Cross-Modality Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-modal image translation remains brittle and inefficient. Standard diffusion approaches often rely on a single, global linear transfer between domains. We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps.</description>

      <title>SeNeDiF-OOD: Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection Methodology in Open-World Classification. A Case Study on Monument Style Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.</description>

      <title>Glance and Focus Reinforcement for Pan-cancer Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real-time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real-time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>OS-Marathon: Benchmarking Computer-Use Agents on Long-Horizon Repetitive Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-horizon, repetitive workflows are common in professional settings, such as processing expense reports from receipts and entering student grades from exam papers. These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections.

      <title>MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.</description>

      <title>Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy with Salience Estimation in Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</description>

      <title>Beyond Global Alignment: Fine-Grained Motion-Language Retrieval via Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>VideoAesBench: Benchmarking the Video Aesthetics Perception Capabilities of Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment. The data will be released on https://github.com/michaelliyunhao/VideoAesBench</description>

      <title>VisionTrim: Unified Vision Token Compression for Training-Free MLLM Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

      <title>Gated Relational Alignment via Confidence-based Distillation for Efficient VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong multimodal performance but are costly to deploy, and post-training quantization often causes significant accuracy loss. Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance. Using real INT4 kernel, we achieve 3$\times$ throughput with 54% memory reduction. This principled framework significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, making GRACE a compelling solution for resource-constrained deployment.</description>

      <title>Is Training Necessary for Anomaly Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) methods rely on training encoder-decoder models to reconstruct anomaly-free features. We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/longkukuhi/RAD.</description>

      <title>Under-Canopy Terrain Reconstruction in Dense Forests Using RGB Imaging and Neural 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the terrain and understory hidden beneath dense forest canopies is of great interest for numerous applications such as search and rescue, trail mapping, forest inventory tasks, and more. Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.
  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.
  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images). Additionally, we show the potential of our approach for forest inventory tasks like tree counting. These results position our approach as a cost-effective, high-resolution alternative to specialized sensors for SAR, trail mapping, and forest-inventory tasks.</description>

      <title>Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image embeddings are generally assumed to pose limited privacy risk. We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1</description>

      <title>Parameter-efficient Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Learning using Factorized Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task and multi-domain learning methods seek to learn multiple tasks/domains, jointly or one after another, using a single unified network. The primary challenge and opportunity lie in leveraging shared information across these tasks and domains to enhance the efficiency of the unified network. The efficiency can be in terms of accuracy, storage cost, computation, or sample complexity. In this paper, we introduce a factorized tensor network (FTN) designed to achieve accuracy comparable to that of independent single-task or single-domain networks, while introducing a minimal number of additional parameters. The FTN approach entails incorporating task- or domain-specific low-rank tensor factors into a shared frozen network derived from a source model. This strategy allows for adaptation to numerous target domains and tasks without encountering catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, FTN requires a significantly smaller number of task-specific parameters compared to existing methods. We performed experiments on widely used multi-domain and multi-task datasets. We show the experiments on convolutional-based architecture with different backbones and on transformer-based architecture. Our findings indicate that FTN attains similar accuracy as single-task or single-domain methods while using only a fraction of additional parameters per task.

      <description>arXiv:2406.17381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic capability to continuously learn a changing data stream is a desideratum of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, current DNNs suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which interferes with remembering past knowledge. To mitigate this issue, existing Continual Learning (CL) approaches often retain exemplars for replay, regularize learning, or allocate dedicated capacity for new tasks. This paper investigates an unexplored direction for CL called Retrospective Feature Estimation (RFE). RFE learns to reverse feature changes by aligning the features from the current trained DNN backward to the feature space of the old task, where performing predictions is easier. This retrospective process utilizes a chain of small feature mapping networks called retrospector modules. Empirical experiments on several CL benchmarks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet, demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this novel CL direction compared to existing representative CL methods, motivating further research into retrospective mechanisms as a principled alternative for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in CL.

      <title>Invariant Representation Guided Multimodal Sentiment Decoding with Sequential Variation Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving consistent sentiment representation across diverse modalities remains a key challenge in multimodal sentiment analysis. However, rapid emotional fluctuations over time often introduce instability, leading to compromised prediction performance. To address this challenge, we propose a robust sentiment representation dual enhancement strategy that simultaneously enhances the temporal and modality dimensions, guided by targeted mechanisms in both forward and backward propagation. Specifically, in the modality dimension, we introduce a modality invariant fusion mechanism that fosters stable cross-modal representations, which aim to capture the common and stable representations shared across different modalities. In the temporal dimension, we impose a specialized sequential variation regularization term that regulates the model's learning trajectory during backward propagation, which is essentially total variation regularization degenerated into one-dimensional linear differences. Extensive experiments on three standard public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Future frame prediction in chest and liver cine MRI using the PCA respiratory motion model: comparing transformers and dynamically trained recurrent neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory motion complicates accurate irradiation of thoraco-abdominal tumors in radiotherapy, as treatment-system latency entails target-location uncertainties. This work addresses frame forecasting in chest and liver cine MRI to compensate for such delays. We investigate RNNs trained with online learning algorithms, enabling adaptation to changing respiratory patterns via on-the-fly parameter updates, and transformers, increasingly common in time series forecasting for their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Experiments were conducted using 12 sagittal thoracic and upper-abdominal cine-MRI sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU. PCA decomposes the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow field into static deformations and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various methods forecasting the latter: linear filters, population and sequence-specific encoder-only transformers, and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces, and sparse one-step approximation (SnAp-1). Predicted displacements were used to warp the reference frame and generate future images. Prediction accuracy decreased with the horizon h. Linear regression performed best at short horizons (1.3mm geometrical error at h=0.32s, ETH Z\"urich data), while RTRL and SnAp-1 outperformed the other algorithms at medium-to-long horizons, with geometrical errors below 1.4mm and 2.8mm on the sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU (the latter featuring higher motion variability, noise, and lower contrast), respectively. The sequence-specific transformer was competitive for low-to-medium horizons, but transformers remained overall limited by data scarcity and domain shift between datasets. Predicted frames visually resembled the ground truth, with notable errors occurring near the diaphragm at end-inspiration and regions affected by out-of-plane motion.</description>

      <title>HI-SLAM2: Geometry-Aware Gaussian SLAM for Fast Monocular Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HI-SLAM2, a geometry-aware Gaussian SLAM system that achieves fast and accurate monocular scene reconstruction using only RGB input. Existing Neural SLAM or 3DGS-based SLAM methods often trade off between rendering quality and geometry accuracy, our research demonstrates that both can be achieved simultaneously with RGB input alone. The key idea of our approach is to enhance the ability for geometry estimation by combining easy-to-obtain monocular priors with learning-based dense SLAM, and then using 3D Gaussian splatting as our core map representation to efficiently model the scene. Upon loop closure, our method ensures on-the-fly global consistency through efficient pose graph bundle adjustment and instant map updates by explicitly deforming the 3D Gaussian units based on anchored keyframe updates. Furthermore, we introduce a grid-based scale alignment strategy to maintain improved scale consistency in prior depths for finer depth details. Through extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++, we demonstrate significant improvements over existing Neural SLAM methods and even surpass RGB-D-based methods in both reconstruction and rendering quality. The project page and source code will be made available at https://hi-slam2.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Lens: Uncovering Decision Strategies in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large language models (LLMs), each block operates on the residual stream to map input token sequences to output token distributions. However, most of the interpretability literature focuses on internal latent representations, leaving token-space dynamics underexplored. The high dimensionality and categoricity of token distributions hinder their analysis, as standard statistical descriptors are not suitable. We show that the entropy of logit-lens predictions overcomes these issues. In doing so, it provides a per-layer scalar, permutation-invariant metric. We introduce Entropy-Lens to distill the token-space dynamics of the residual stream into a low-dimensional signal. We call this signal the entropy profile. We apply our method to a variety of model sizes and families, showing that (i) entropy profiles uncover token prediction dynamics driven by expansion and pruning strategies; (ii) these dynamics are family-specific and invariant under depth rescaling; (iii) they are characteristic of task type and output format; (iv) these strategies have unequal impact on downstream performance, with the expansion strategy usually being more critical. Ultimately, our findings further enhance our understanding of the residual stream, enabling a granular assessment of how information is processed across model depth.</description>

      <title>Helios 2.0: A Robust, Ultra-Low Power Gesture Recognition System Optimised for Event-Sensor based Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an advance in wearable technology: a mobile-optimized, real-time, ultra-low-power event camera system that enables natural hand gesture control for smart glasses, dramatically improving user experience. While hand gesture recognition in computer vision has advanced significantly, critical challenges remain in creating systems that are intuitive, adaptable across diverse users and environments, and energy-efficient enough for practical wearable applications. Our approach tackles these challenges through carefully selected microgestures: lateral thumb swipes across the index finger (in both directions) and a double pinch between thumb and index fingertips. These human-centered interactions leverage natural hand movements, ensuring intuitive usability without requiring users to learn complex command sequences. To overcome variability in users and environments, we developed a novel simulation methodology that enables comprehensive domain sampling without extensive real-world data collection. Our power-optimised architecture maintains exceptional performance, achieving F1 scores above 80\% on benchmark datasets featuring diverse users and environments. The resulting models operate at just 6-8 mW when exploiting the Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon DSP, with our 2-channel implementation exceeding 70\% F1 accuracy and our 6-channel model surpassing 80\% F1 accuracy across all gesture classes in user studies. These results were achieved using only synthetic training data. This improves on the state-of-the-art for F1 accuracy by 20\% with a power reduction 25x when using DSP. This advancement brings deploying ultra-low-power vision systems in wearable devices closer and opens new possibilities for seamless human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>OpenPros: A Large-Scale Dataset for Limited View Prostate Ultrasound Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers among men, motivating the development of accurate and accessible imaging technologies for early detection. Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) reconstructs quantitative tissue parameters such as speed-of-sound (SOS) and is a promising low-cost alternative to existing modalities. However, prostate USCT remains challenging due to limited-angle acquisition, strong tissue heterogeneity, bone-induced wave distortion, and the lack of large-scale, anatomically realistic datasets for method development and evaluation. We introduce OPENPROS, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for limited-angle prostate USCT, designed to systematically evaluate machine learning methods for quantitative inverse problems. OPENPROS contains over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D SOS maps and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from 4 clinical MRI/CT scans and 62 ex vivo prostate specimens with experimental ultrasound measurements. Wave propagation is simulated under clinically realistic configurations using open-source finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta solvers. We provide standardized training, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution benchmarks and evaluate representative deep learning baselines. While learning-based methods substantially improve inference speed and reconstruction accuracy over physics-based approaches, results highlight persistent challenges in robustness, generalization, and high-resolution reconstruction quality. By publicly releasing OPENPROS, we establish a rigorous benchmark to support research in inverse problems, physics-guided learning, and operator learning, and to bridge the gap between machine learning research and practical USCT deployment. The dataset is available at https://open-pros.github.io/.</description>

      <title>MineInsight: A Multi-sensor Dataset for Humanitarian Demining Robotics in Off-Road Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset provides bounding boxes generated by an automated pipeline and refined with human supervision. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/mariomlz99/MineInsight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.</description>

      <title>Bridging GANs and Bayesian Neural Networks via Partial Stochasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging. In this work, we explain the success and limitations of GANs by casting them as Bayesian neural networks with partial stochasticity. This interpretation allows us to establish conditions of universal approximation and to rewrite the adversarial-style optimization of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the likelihood obtained by marginalizing out the stochastic variables. Following this interpretation, the need for regularization becomes apparent, and we propose to adopt strategies to smooth the loss landscape and methods to search for solutions with minimum description length, which are associated with flat minima and good generalization. Results obtained on a wide range of experiments indicate that these strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper understanding of GANs.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back the Curtain on Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22832v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods typically associate each output score of a deep neural network with an input-space direction, most commonly instantiated as the gradient and visualized as a saliency map. However, these approaches often yield explanations that are noisy, lack perceptual alignment and, thus, offer limited interpretability. While many explanation methods attempt to address this issue via modified backward rules or additional heuristics, such approaches are often difficult to justify theoretically and frequently fail basic sanity checks. We introduce Semantic Pullbacks (SP), a faithful and effective post-hoc explanation method for deep neural networks. Semantic Pullbacks address the limitations above by isolating the network's effective linear action via a principled pullback formulation and refining it to recover coherent local structures learned by the target neuron. As a result, SP produces perceptually aligned, class-conditional explanations that highlight meaningful features, support compelling counterfactual perturbations, and admit a clear theoretical motivation. Across standard faithfulness benchmarks, Semantic Pullbacks significantly outperform established attribution methods on both classical convolutional architectures (ResNet50, VGG) and transformer-based models (PVT), while remaining general and computationally efficient. Our method can be easily plugged into existing deep learning pipelines and extended to other modalities.</description>

      <title>STELAR-VISION: Self-Topology-Aware Efficient Learning for Aligned Reasoning in Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks.</description>

      <title>From Slices to Structures: Unsupervised 3D Reconstruction of Female Pelvic Anatomy from Freehand Transvaginal Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal ultrasound sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose estimators. Our method, TVGS, adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their parameters directly from image-level supervision. To ensure robustness against irregular probe motion, we introduce a joint optimization scheme that refines slice poses alongside anatomical structure. The result is a compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare is constrained by knowledge limitations, hallucinations, and a disconnect from Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution, current systems often rely on static workflows that miss the iterative, hypothetico-deductive reasoning of clinicians. To address this, we introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end via reinforcement learning (RL) for traceable diagnostic reasoning. Deep-DxSearch acts as an active investigator, treating the LLM as an agent within an environment of 16,000+ guideline-derived disease profiles, 150,000+ patient records for case-based reasoning, and over 27 million biomedical documents. Using soft verifiable rewards that co-optimize retrieval and reasoning, the model learns to formulate queries, evaluate evidence, and refine searches to close diagnostic gaps. Experiments show our end-to-end RL framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG methods. On in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks for common and rare diseases, Deep-DxSearch surpasses strong baselines-including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and medical-specific frameworks-achieving an average accuracy gain of 22.7% over the second-best model. In validation with 150 real-world cases, Deep-DxSearch boosts physicians' average diagnostic accuracy from 45.6% to 69.1%. These results indicate that evolving agentic systems to leverage statistical regularities in large-scale healthcare data is key for trustworthy diagnostic assistants. All data, code, and checkpoints are available at https://qiaoyu-zheng.github.io/Deep-DxSearch.</description>

      <title>RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data. While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and image generation. These models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM obviates this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP)-&gt;Image Restoration (IR) pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts many challenges. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE), encoding sensor RAW and decoding it into an enhanced linear domain image, to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues between the different domain distributions; (2) a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module, adapting diverse RAW Bayer patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable data synthesis pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts. Codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/YanCHEN-fr/RDDM.</description>

      <title>Environmental Injection Attacks against GUI Agents in Realistic Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents are increasingly deployed to interact with online web services, yet their exposure to open-world content renders them vulnerable to Environmental Injection Attacks (EIAs). In these attacks, an attacker can inject crafted triggers into website to manipulate the behavior of GUI agents used by other users. In this paper, we find that most existing EIA studies fall short of realism. In particular, they fail to capture the dynamic nature of real-world web content, often assuming that a trigger's on-screen position and surrounding visual context remain largely consistent between training and testing. To better reflect practice, we introduce a realistic dynamic-environment threat model in which the attacker is a regular user and the trigger is embedded within a dynamically changing environment. Under this threat model, existing approaches largely fail, suggesting that their effectiveness in exposing GUI agent vulnerabilities has been substantially overestimated.
  To expose the hidden vulnerabilities of existing GUI agents effectively, we propose Chameleon, an attack framework with two key novelties designed for dynamic environments. (1) To synthesize more realistic training data, we introduce LLM-Driven Environment Simulation, which automatically generates diverse, high-fidelity webpage simulations that mimic the variability of real-world dynamic environments. (2) To optimize the trigger more effectively, we introduce Attention Black Hole, which converts attention weights into explicit supervisory signals. This mechanism encourages the agent to remain insensitive to irrelevant surrounding content, thereby improving robustness in dynamic environments. We evaluate Chameleon on six realistic websites and four representative LVLM-powered GUI agents, where it significantly outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Intra-Cluster Mixup: An Effective Data Augmentation Technique for Complementary-Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning (CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms, achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Stroke Rehabilitation Domiciliary Assessment System with ST_GCN Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective stroke recovery requires continuous rehabilitation integrated with daily living. To support this need, we propose a home-based rehabilitation exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture stroke movements, (2) a mobile application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and feedback. When a stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the system records skeleton sequences, which are then assessed by the deep learning model, RAST-G@ (Rehabilitation Assessment Spatio-Temporal Graph ATtention). The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living (ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists. Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.</description>

      <title>SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Remote Sensing Image via Multi-Frame and Multi-Source Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) imaging is constrained by hardware cost and physical limitations, making high-quality image acquisition challenging and motivating image fusion for quality enhancement. Multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) and Pansharpening exploit complementary information from multiple frames and multiple sources, respectively, but are usually studied in isolation: MFSR lacks high-resolution structural priors for fine-grained texture recovery, while Pansharpening depends on upsampled multispectral images and is sensitive to noise and misalignment. With the rapid development of the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT), effectively leveraging large numbers of low-quality yet information-complementary images has become increasingly important. To this end, we propose SatFusion, a unified framework for enhancing RS images via joint multi-frame and multi-source fusion. SatFusion employs a Multi-Frame Image Fusion (MFIF) module to extract high-resolution semantic features from multiple low-resolution multispectral frames, and integrates fine-grained structural information from a high-resolution panchromatic image through a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module, enabling robust feature integration with implicit pixel-level alignment. To further mitigate the lack of structural priors in multi-frame fusion, we introduce SatFusion*, which incorporates a panchromatic-guided mechanism into the multi-frame fusion stage. By combining structure-aware feature embedding with transformer-based adaptive aggregation, SatFusion* enables spatially adaptive selection of multi-frame features and strengthens the coupling between multi-frame and multi-source representations. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing approaches in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness, and generalizability.</description>

      <title>VisJudge-Bench: Aesthetics and Quality Assessment of Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios, covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across 32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.553 and a correlation with human ratings of only 0.428. To address this issue, we propose VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.421 (a 23.9% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.687 (a 60.5% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/VisJudgeBench.</description>

      <title>TabRAG: Improving Tabular Document Question Answering for Retrieval Augmented Generation via Structured Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge bases in traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) relies on parsing the document, followed by querying a language model with the parsed information via in-context learning. While effective for text-based documents, question answering on tabular documents often fails to generate plausible responses. Standard parsing techniques lose the two-dimensional structural semantics critical for cell interpretation. In this work, we present TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG framework designed to improve tabular document question answering via structured representations. Our framework consists of layout segmentation that decomposes the document inputs into a series of components, enabling fine-grained extraction. Subsequently, a vision language model parses and extracts the document tables into a hierarchically structured representation. In order to cater various table styles and formats, we integrate a self-generated in-context learning module that guides the table extraction process. Experimental results demonstrate that TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing techniques across a broad suite of evaluation and ablation benchmarks.

      <title>Collaborative Representation Learning for Alignment of Tactile, Language, and Vision Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11512v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Detection Under Representation and Training Paradigm Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the largest systematic comparison to date of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics. Our comparison explores different regimes of distribution shift (stratified by CLIP embeddings of the out-of-distribution image datasets) with varying numbers of classes and uses a representation-centric view of OOD detection, including neural collapse metrics, for subsequent analysis. Together the empirical results and representation analysis provides novel insights and statistically grounded guidance for method selection under distribution shift. Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors. The neural-collapse-based geometric analysis explains when prototype and boundary-based scores become optimal under strong shifts.</description>

      <title>AVERY: Adaptive VLM Split Computing through Embodied Self-Awareness for Efficient Disaster Response Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>CostNav: A Navigation Benchmark for Real-World Economic-Cost Evaluation of Physical AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current navigation benchmarks prioritize task success in simplified settings, they neglect the multidimensional economic constraints essential for the real-world commercialization of autonomous delivery systems. We introduce CostNav, an Economic Navigation Benchmark that evaluates physical AI agents through comprehensive economic cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. By integrating industry-standard data - such as SEC filings and AIS injury reports - with Isaac Sim's detailed collision and cargo dynamics, CostNav transcends simple task completion to accurately evaluate business value in complex, real-world scenarios. To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability, revealing that optimizing for task success on a simplified task fundamentally differs from optimizing for real-world economic deployment. Our evaluation of rule-based Nav2 navigation shows that current approaches are not economically viable: the contribution margin is -22.81/run (AMCL) and -12.87/run (GPS), resulting in no break-even point. We challenge the community to develop navigation policies that achieve economic viability on CostNav. We remain method-agnostic, evaluating success solely on the metric of cost rather than the underlying architecture. All resources are available at https://github.com/worv-ai/CostNav.</description>

      <title>CrossCheck-Bench: Diagnosing Compositional Failures in Multimodal Conflict Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are primarily trained and evaluated on aligned image-text pairs, which leaves their ability to detect and resolve real-world inconsistencies largely unexplored. In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality (AR) collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360{\deg} 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubles pedestrians' time to collision and increases counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next generation safety tool for urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Tumor-anchored deep feature random forests for out-of-distribution detection in lung cancer segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cancerous lesions from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and response assessment. However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks to safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a lightweight, plug-and-play post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 2,056 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC &gt; 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC &gt; 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained consistent performance across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes.</description>

      <title>On the Design of One-step Diffusion via Shortcutting Flow Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11831v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in few-step diffusion models have demonstrated their efficiency and effectiveness by shortcutting the probabilistic paths of diffusion models, especially in training one-step diffusion models from scratch (\emph{a.k.a.} shortcut models). However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting with one step generation, and further reaches FID50k of 2.53 with 2x training steps. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space.</description>

      <title>Position: Universal Aesthetic Alignment Narrows Artistic Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-aligning image generation models to a generalized aesthetic preference conflicts with user intent, particularly when "anti-aesthetic" outputs are requested for artistic or critical purposes. This adherence prioritizes developer-centered values, compromising user autonomy and aesthetic pluralism. We test this bias by constructing a wide-spectrum aesthetics dataset and evaluating state-of-the-art generation and reward models. This position paper finds that aesthetic-aligned generation models frequently default to conventionally beautiful outputs, failing to respect instructions for low-quality or negative imagery. Crucially, reward models penalize anti-aesthetic images even when they perfectly match the explicit user prompt. We confirm this systemic bias through image-to-image editing and evaluation against real abstract artworks.</description>

      <title>UNIC: Learning Unified Multimodal Extrinsic Contact Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation requires reliable estimation of extrinsic contacts-the interactions between a grasped object and its environment which provide essential contextual information for planning, control, and policy learning. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as predefined contact types, fixed grasp configurations, or camera calibration, that hinder generalization to novel objects and deployment in unstructured environments. In this paper, we present UNIC, a unified multimodal framework for extrinsic contact estimation that operates without any prior knowledge or camera calibration. UNIC directly encodes visual observations in the camera frame and integrates them with proprioceptive and tactile modalities in a fully data-driven manner. It introduces a unified contact representation based on scene affordance maps that captures diverse contact formations and employs a multimodal fusion mechanism with random masking, enabling robust multimodal representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIC performs reliably. It achieves a 9.6 mm average Chamfer distance error on unseen contact locations, performs well on unseen objects, remains robust under missing modalities, and adapts to dynamic camera viewpoints. These results establish extrinsic contact estimation as a practical and versatile capability for contact-rich manipulation.

      <title>Attention in Geometry: Scalable Spatial Modeling via Adaptive Density Fields and FAISS-Accelerated Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Adaptive Density Fields (ADF), a geometric attention framework that formulates spatial aggregation as a query-conditioned, metric-induced attention operator in continuous space. By reinterpreting spatial influence as geometry-preserving attention grounded in physical distance, ADF bridges concepts from adaptive kernel methods and attention mechanisms. Scalability is achieved via FAISS-accelerated inverted file indices, treating approximate nearest-neighbor search as an intrinsic component of the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the framework through a case study on aircraft trajectory analysis in the Chengdu region, extracting trajectory-conditioned Zones of Influence (ZOI) to reveal recurrent airspace structures and localized deviations.</description>

      <title>VULCA-Bench: A Multicultural Vision-Language Benchmark for Evaluating Cultural Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VULCA-Bench, a multicultural art-critique benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) cultural understanding beyond surface-level visual perception. Existing VLM benchmarks predominantly measure L1-L2 capabilities (object recognition, scene description, and factual question answering) while under-evaluate higher-order cultural interpretation. VULCA-Bench contains 7,410 matched image-critique pairs spanning eight cultural traditions, with Chinese-English bilingual coverage. We operationalise cultural understanding using a five-layer framework (L1-L5, from Visual Perception to Philosophical Aesthetics), instantiated as 225 culture-specific dimensions and supported by expert-written bilingual critiques. Our pilot results indicate that higher-layer reasoning (L3-L5) is consistently more challenging than visual and technical analysis (L1-L2). The dataset, evaluation scripts, and annotation tools are available under CC BY 4.0 in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12946v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description>

      <title>LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15197v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Probabilistic Interpolation for GEDI Biomass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.</description>

      <title>Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9% to 65.56% (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved 67.62% (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached 75.30%, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved 72.68% (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.</description>
