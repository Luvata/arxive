      <title>MARS: A neurosymbolic approach for interpretable drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence describes the combination of logic or rule-based techniques with neural networks. Compared to neural approaches, NeSy methods often possess enhanced interpretability, which is particularly promising for biomedical applications like drug discovery. However, since interpretability is broadly defined, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the biological plausibility of model interpretations. To assess interpretability in the context of drug discovery, we devise a novel prediction task, called drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) deconvolution, with an associated, tailored knowledge graph (KG), MoA-net. We then develop the MoA Retrieval System (MARS), a NeSy approach for drug discovery which leverages logical rules with learned rule weights. Using this interpretable feature alongside domain knowledge, we find that MARS and other NeSy approaches on KGs are susceptible to reasoning shortcuts, in which the prediction of true labels is driven by "degree-bias" rather than the domain-based rules. Subsequently, we demonstrate ways to identify and mitigate this. Thereafter, MARS achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art models while producing model interpretations aligned with known MoAs.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Next-Generation Language Models for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (NeLaMKRR 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence as it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more data. Despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to pin down to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.
  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives, to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and using logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analyzing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalizing the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are a key requirement.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Interpretable Control Policies through Large Language Model Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLMs), systematic evaluation, and evolutionary algorithms has enabled breakthroughs in combinatorial optimization and scientific discovery. We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but leverage it at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks. We make the code available at https://github.com/muellerlab/synthesizing_interpretable_control_policies.git</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Tree-Structured Probabilistic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have emerged as a powerful framework to compactly represent probability distributions for efficient and exact probabilistic inference. It has been shown that PCs with a general directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure can be understood as a mixture of exponentially (in its height) many components, each of which is a product distribution over univariate marginals. However, existing structure learning algorithms for PCs often generate tree-structured circuits or use tree-structured circuits as intermediate steps to compress them into DAG-structured circuits. This leads to the intriguing question of whether there exists an exponential gap between DAGs and trees for the PC structure. In this paper, we provide a negative answer to this conjecture by proving that, for $n$ variables, there exists a sub-exponential upper bound $n^{O(\log n)}$ on the size of an equivalent tree computing the same probability distribution. On the other hand, we also show that given a depth restriction on the tree, there is a super-polynomial separation between tree and DAG-structured PCs. Our work takes an important step towards understanding the expressive power of tree-structured PCs, and our techniques may be of independent interest in the study of structure learning algorithms for PCs.</description>

      <title>Ensured: Explanations for Decreasing the Epistemic Uncertainty in Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a significant gap in explainable AI: the necessity of interpreting epistemic uncertainty in model explanations. Although current methods mainly focus on explaining predictions, with some including uncertainty, they fail to provide guidance on how to reduce the inherent uncertainty in these predictions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce new types of explanations that specifically target epistemic uncertainty. These include ensured explanations, which highlight feature modifications that can reduce uncertainty, and categorisation of uncertain explanations counter-potential, semi-potential, and super-potential which explore alternative scenarios. Our work emphasises that epistemic uncertainty adds a crucial dimension to explanation quality, demanding evaluation based not only on prediction probability but also on uncertainty reduction. We introduce a new metric, ensured ranking, designed to help users identify the most reliable explanations by balancing trade-offs between uncertainty, probability, and competing alternative explanations. Furthermore, we extend the Calibrated Explanations method, incorporating tools that visualise how changes in feature values impact epistemic uncertainty. This enhancement provides deeper insights into model behaviour, promoting increased interpretability and appropriate trust in scenarios involving uncertain predictions.</description>

      <title>Intuitions of Compromise: Utilitarianism vs. Contractualism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the best compromise in a situation where different people value different things? The most commonly accepted method for answering this question -- in fields across the behavioral and social sciences, decision theory, philosophy, and artificial intelligence development -- is simply to add up utilities associated with the different options and pick the solution with the largest sum. This ``utilitarian'' approach seems like the obvious, theory-neutral way of approaching the problem. But there is an important, though often-ignored, alternative: a ``contractualist'' approach, which advocates for an agreement-driven method of deciding. Remarkably, no research has presented empirical evidence directly comparing the intuitive plausibility of these two approaches. In this paper, we systematically explore the proposals suggested by each algorithm (the ``Utilitarian Sum'' and the contractualist ''Nash Product''), using a paradigm that applies those algorithms to aggregating preferences across groups in a social decision-making context. While the dominant approach to value aggregation up to now has been utilitarian, we find that people strongly prefer the aggregations recommended by the contractualist algorithm. Finally, we compare the judgments of large language models (LLMs) to that of our (human) participants, finding important misalignment between model and human preferences.</description>

      <title>Versatile Motion Langauge Models for Multi-Turn Interactive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their ability to generate natural and contextually relevant text, making AI interactions more human-like. However, generating and understanding interactive human-like motion, where two individuals engage in coordinated movements, remains a challenge due to the complexity of modeling these coordinated interactions. Furthermore, a versatile model is required to handle diverse interactive scenarios, such as chat systems that follow user instructions or adapt to their assigned role while adjusting interaction dynamics. To tackle this problem, we introduce VIM, short for the Versatile Interactive Motion language model, which integrates both language and motion modalities to effectively understand, generate, and control interactive motions in multi-turn conversational contexts. To address the scarcity of multi-turn interactive motion data, we introduce a synthetic dataset, INERT-MT2, where we utilize pre-trained models to create diverse instructional datasets with interactive motion. Our approach first trains a motion tokenizer that encodes interactive motions into residual discrete tokens. In the pretraining stage, the model learns to align motion and text representations with these discrete tokens. During the instruction fine-tuning stage, VIM adapts to multi-turn conversations using the INTER-MT2 dataset. We evaluate the versatility of our method across motion-related tasks, motion to text, text to motion, reaction generation, motion editing, and reasoning about motion sequences. The results highlight the versatility and effectiveness of proposed method in handling complex interactive motion synthesis.</description>

      <title>On the Modeling Capabilities of Large Language Models for Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pretrained models are showing increasingly better performance in reasoning and planning tasks across different modalities, opening the possibility to leverage them for complex sequential decision making problems. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reinforcement learning (RL) across a diversity of interactive domains. We evaluate their ability to produce decision-making policies, either directly, by generating actions, or indirectly, by first generating reward models to train an agent with RL. Our results show that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, LLMs excel at reward modeling. In particular, crafting rewards through artificial intelligence (AI) feedback yields the most generally applicable approach and can enhance performance by improving credit assignment and exploration. Finally, in environments with unfamiliar dynamics, we explore how fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data can significantly improve their reward modeling capabilities while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, further broadening their utility in sequential decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>ACPBench: Reasoning about Action, Change, and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing body of work using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents for orchestrating workflows and making decisions in domains that require planning and multi-step reasoning. As a result, it is imperative to evaluate LLMs on core skills required for planning. In this work, we present ACPBench, a benchmark for evaluating the reasoning tasks in the field of planning. The benchmark consists of 7 reasoning tasks over 13 planning domains. The collection is constructed from planning domains described in a formal language. This allows us to synthesize problems with provably correct solutions across many tasks and domains. Further, it allows us the luxury of scale without additional human effort, i.e., many additional problems can be created automatically. Our extensive evaluation of 22 open-sourced and frontier LLMs highlight the significant gap in the reasoning capability of the LLMs. The average accuracy of one of the best-performing frontier LLMs -- GPT-4o on these tasks can fall as low as 52.50% ACPBench collection is available at https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench.</description>

      <title>Reducing fuzzy relation equations via concept lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has taken into advantage the relationship between Fuzzy Relation Equations (FRE) and Concept Lattices in order to introduce a procedure to reduce a FRE, without losing information. Specifically, attribute reduction theory in property-oriented and object-oriented concept lattices has been considered in order to present a mechanism for detecting redundant equations. As a first consequence, the computation of the whole solution set of a solvable FRE is reduced. Moreover, we will also introduce a novel method for computing approximate solutions of unsolvable FRE related to a (real) dataset with uncertainty/imprecision data.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Anytime Discovery of Generalised Multimodal Graph Patterns for Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vast amounts of heterogeneous knowledge are becoming publicly available in the form of knowledge graphs, often linking multiple sources of data that have never been together before, and thereby enabling scholars to answer many new research questions. It is often not known beforehand, however, which questions the data might have the answers to, potentially leaving many interesting and novel insights to remain undiscovered. To support scholars during this scientific workflow, we introduce an anytime algorithm for the bottom-up discovery of generalized multimodal graph patterns in knowledge graphs. Each pattern is a conjunction of binary statements with (data-) type variables, constants, and/or value patterns. Upon discovery, the patterns are converted to SPARQL queries and presented in an interactive facet browser together with metadata and provenance information, enabling scholars to explore, analyse, and share queries. We evaluate our method from a user perspective, with the help of domain experts in the humanities.</description>

      <title>Heuristics for Partially Observable Stochastic Contingent Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acting to complete tasks in stochastic partially observable domains is an important problem in artificial intelligence, and is often formulated as a goal-based POMDP. Goal-based POMDPs can be solved using the RTDP-BEL algorithm, that operates by running forward trajectories from the initial belief to the goal. These trajectories can be guided by a heuristic, and more accurate heuristics can result in significantly faster convergence. In this paper, we develop a heuristic function that leverages the structured representation of domain models. We compute, in a relaxed space, a plan to achieve the goal, while taking into account the value of information, as well as the stochastic effects. We provide experiments showing that while our heuristic is slower to compute, it requires an order of magnitude less trajectories before convergence. Overall, it thus speeds up RTDP-BEL, particularly in problems where significant information gathering is needed.</description>

      <title>Athanor: Local Search over Abstract Constraint Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local search is a common method for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. We focus on general-purpose local search solvers that accept as input a constraint model - a declarative description of a problem consisting of a set of decision variables under a set of constraints. Existing approaches typically take as input models written in solver-independent constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc. The Athanor solver we describe herein differs in that it begins from a specification of a problem in the abstract constraint specification language Essence, which allows problems to be described without commitment to low-level modelling decisions through its support for a rich set of abstract types. The advantage of proceeding from Essence is that the structure apparent in a concise, abstract specification of a problem can be exploited to generate high quality neighbourhoods automatically, avoiding the difficult task of identifying that structure in an equivalent constraint model. Based on the twin benefits of neighbourhoods derived from high level types and the scalability derived by searching directly over those types, our empirical results demonstrate strong performance in practice relative to existing solution methods.</description>

      <title>Coevolving with the Other You: Fine-Tuning LLM with Sequential Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>ConceptAgent: LLM-Driven Precondition Grounding and Tree Search for Robust Task Planning and Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic planning and execution in open-world environments is a complex problem due to the vast state spaces and high variability of task embodiment. Recent advances in perception algorithms, combined with Large Language Models (LLMs) for planning, offer promising solutions to these challenges, as the common sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs provide a strong heuristic for efficiently searching the action space. However, prior work fails to address the possibility of hallucinations from LLMs, which results in failures to execute the planned actions largely due to logical fallacies at high- or low-levels. To contend with automation failure due to such hallucinations, we introduce ConceptAgent, a natural language-driven robotic platform designed for task execution in unstructured environments. With a focus on scalability and reliability of LLM-based planning in complex state and action spaces, we present innovations designed to limit these shortcomings, including 1) Predicate Grounding to prevent and recover from infeasible actions, and 2) an embodied version of LLM-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search with self reflection. In simulation experiments, ConceptAgent achieved a 19% task completion rate across three room layouts and 30 easy level embodied tasks outperforming other state-of-the-art LLM-driven reasoning baselines that scored 10.26% and 8.11% on the same benchmark. Additionally, ablation studies on moderate to hard embodied tasks revealed a 20% increase in task completion from the baseline agent to the fully enhanced ConceptAgent, highlighting the individual and combined contributions of Predicate Grounding and LLM-guided Tree Search to enable more robust automation in complex state and action spaces.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Situational Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, demonstrating impressive capabilities as multimodal assistants that interact with both humans and their environments. However, this increased sophistication introduces significant safety concerns. In this paper, we present the first evaluation and analysis of a novel safety challenge termed Multimodal Situational Safety, which explores how safety considerations vary based on the specific situation in which the user or agent is engaged. We argue that for an MLLM to respond safely, whether through language or action, it often needs to assess the safety implications of a language query within its corresponding visual context. To evaluate this capability, we develop the Multimodal Situational Safety benchmark (MSSBench) to assess the situational safety performance of current MLLMs. The dataset comprises 1,820 language query-image pairs, half of which the image context is safe, and the other half is unsafe. We also develop an evaluation framework that analyzes key safety aspects, including explicit safety reasoning, visual understanding, and, crucially, situational safety reasoning. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with this nuanced safety problem in the instruction-following setting and struggle to tackle these situational safety challenges all at once, highlighting a key area for future research. Furthermore, we develop multi-agent pipelines to coordinately solve safety challenges, which shows consistent improvement in safety over the original MLLM response.

      <title>PREDICT: Preference Reasoning by Evaluating Decomposed preferences Inferred from Candidate Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating AI agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</description>

Abstract: Collectible card games are challenging, widely played games that have received increasing attention from the AI research community in recent years. Despite important breakthroughs, the field still poses many unresolved challenges.

      <title>Boolean Nearest Neighbor Language in the Knowledge Compilation Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boolean Nearest Neighbor (BNN) representation of Boolean functions was recently introduced by Hajnal, Liu and Turan. A BNN representation of $f$ is a pair $(P,N)$ of sets of Boolean vectors (called positive and negative prototypes) where $f(x)=1$ for every positive prototype $x \in P$, $f(x)=0$ for all every negative prototype $x \in N$, and the value $f(x)$ for $x \not\in P \cup N$ is determined by the type of the closest prototype. The main aim of this paper is to determine the position of the BNN language in the Knowledge Compilation Map (KCM). To this end, we derive results which compare the succinctness of the BNN language to several standard languages from KCM, and determine the complexity status of most standard queries and transformations for BNN inputs.</description>

      <title>Validation of the Scientific Literature via Chemputation Augmented by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemputation is the process of programming chemical robots to do experiments using a universal symbolic language, but the literature can be error prone and hard to read due to ambiguities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including natural language processing, robotic control, and more recently, chemistry. Despite significant advancements in standardizing the reporting and collection of synthetic chemistry data, the automatic reproduction of reported syntheses remains a labour-intensive task. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based chemical research agent workflow designed for the automatic validation of synthetic literature procedures. Our workflow can autonomously extract synthetic procedures and analytical data from extensive documents, translate these procedures into universal XDL code, simulate the execution of the procedure in a hardware-specific setup, and ultimately execute the procedure on an XDL-controlled robotic system for synthetic chemistry. This demonstrates the potential of LLM-based workflows for autonomous chemical synthesis with Chemputers. Due to the abstraction of XDL this approach is safe, secure, and scalable since hallucinations will not be chemputable and the XDL can be both verified and encrypted. Unlike previous efforts, which either addressed only a limited portion of the workflow, relied on inflexible hard-coded rules, or lacked validation in physical systems, our approach provides four realistic examples of syntheses directly executed from synthetic literature. We anticipate that our workflow will significantly enhance automation in robotically driven synthetic chemistry research, streamline data extraction, improve the reproducibility, scalability, and safety of synthetic and experimental chemistry.</description>

      <title>Does Spatial Cognition Emerge in Frontier Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not yet. We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.</description>

      <title>Honesty to Subterfuge: In-Context Reinforcement Learning Can Make Honest Models Reward Hack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that training "helpful-only" LLMs with reinforcement learning on a curriculum of gameable environments can lead models to generalize to egregious specification gaming, such as editing their own reward function or modifying task checklists to appear more successful. We show that gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1-preview, and o1-mini - frontier models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest - can engage in specification gaming without training on a curriculum of tasks, purely from in-context iterative reflection (which we call in-context reinforcement learning, "ICRL"). We also show that using ICRL to generate highly-rewarded outputs for expert iteration (compared to the standard expert iteration reinforcement learning algorithm) may increase gpt-4o-mini's propensity to learn specification-gaming policies, generalizing (in very rare cases) to the most egregious strategy where gpt-4o-mini edits its own reward function. Our results point toward the strong ability of in-context reflection to discover rare specification-gaming strategies that models might not exhibit zero-shot or with normal training, highlighting the need for caution when relying on alignment of LLMs in zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>ST-WebAgentBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Safety and Trustworthiness in Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based web agents have introduced novel architectures and benchmarks showcasing progress in autonomous web navigation and interaction. However, most existing benchmarks prioritize effectiveness and accuracy, overlooking crucial factors like safety and trustworthiness which are essential for deploying web agents in enterprise settings. The risks of unsafe web agent behavior, such as accidentally deleting user accounts or performing unintended actions in critical business operations, pose significant barriers to widespread adoption.In this paper, we present ST-WebAgentBench, a new online benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the safety and trustworthiness of web agents in enterprise contexts. This benchmark is grounded in a detailed framework that defines safe and trustworthy (ST) agent behavior, outlines how ST policies should be structured and introduces the Completion under Policies metric to assess agent performance. Our evaluation reveals that current SOTA agents struggle with policy adherence and cannot yet be relied upon for critical business applications. Additionally, we propose architectural principles aimed at improving policy awareness and compliance in web agents. We open-source this benchmark and invite the community to contribute, with the goal of fostering a new generation of safer, more trustworthy AI agents.</description>

      <title>A Safety Modulator Actor-Critic Method in Model-Free Safe Reinforcement Learning and Application in UAV Hovering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a safety modulator actor-critic (SMAC) method to address safety constraint and overestimation mitigation in model-free safe reinforcement learning (RL). A safety modulator is developed to satisfy safety constraints by modulating actions, allowing the policy to ignore safety constraint and focus on maximizing reward. Additionally, a distributional critic with a theoretical update rule for SMAC is proposed to mitigate the overestimation of Q-values with safety constraints. Both simulation and real-world scenarios experiments on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hovering confirm that the SMAC can effectively maintain safety constraints and outperform mainstream baseline algorithms.</description>

Abstract: AI Safety has become a vital front-line concern of many scientists within and outside the AI community. There are many immediate and long term anticipated risks that range from existential risk to human existence to deep fakes and bias in machine learning systems [1-5]. In this paper, we reduce the full scope and immense complexity of AI safety concerns to a trilogy of three important but tractable opportunities for advances that have the short-term potential to improve AI safety and reliability without reducing AI innovation in critical domains. In this perspective, we discuss this vision based on several case studies that already produced proofs of concept in critical ML applications in biomedical science.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Addressing Delusions for Target-Directed Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in target-directed agents, which produce targets during decision-time planning, to guide their behaviors and achieve better generalization during evaluation. Improper training of these agents can result in delusions: the agent may come to hold false beliefs about the targets, which cannot be properly rejected, leading to unwanted behaviors and damaging out-of-distribution generalization. We identify different types of delusions by using intuitive examples in carefully controlled environments, and investigate their causes. We demonstrate how delusions can be addressed for agents trained by hindsight relabeling, a mainstream approach in for training target-directed RL agents. We validate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in correcting delusional behaviors and improving out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>InstructG2I: Synthesizing Images from Multimodal Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/InstructG2I.</description>

      <title>Complex Logical Query Answering by Calibrating Knowledge Graph Completion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex logical query answering (CLQA) is a challenging task that involves finding answer entities for complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Previous research has explored the use of pre-trained knowledge graph completion (KGC) models, which can predict the missing facts in KGs, to answer complex logical queries. However, KGC models are typically evaluated using ranking evaluation metrics, which may result in values of predictions of KGC models that are not well-calibrated. In this paper, we propose a method for calibrating KGC models, namely CKGC, which enables KGC models to adapt to answering complex logical queries. Notably, CKGC is lightweight and effective. The adaptation function is simple, allowing the model to quickly converge during the adaptation process. The core concept of CKGC is to map the values of predictions of KGC models to the range [0, 1], ensuring that values associated with true facts are close to 1, while values linked to false facts are close to 0. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed calibration method can significantly boost model performance in the CLQA task. Moreover, our approach can enhance the performance of CLQA while preserving the ranking evaluation metrics of KGC models. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/CKGC.</description>

      <title>HiRT: Enhancing Robotic Control with Hierarchical Robot Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</description>

      <title>Scale-Invariant Object Detection by Adaptive Convolution with Unified Global-Local Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense features are important for detecting minute objects in images. Unfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale object detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due to the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution addresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often can lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model. In this paper, we propose an object detection model using a Switchable (adaptive) Atrous Convolutional Network (SAC-Net) based on the efficientDet model. A fixed atrous rate limits the performance of the CNN models in the convolutional layers. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a switchable mechanism that allows for dynamically adjusting the atrous rate during the forward pass. The proposed SAC-Net encapsulates the benefits of both low-level and high-level features to achieve improved performance on multi-scale object detection tasks, without losing the dense features. Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous rate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally, we apply global context on the proposed model.

      <title>Dumpling GNN: Hybrid GNN Enables Better ADC Payload Activity Prediction Based on Chemical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically designed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical structure. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN effectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from MoleculeNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including BBBP (96.4\% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2\% ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87\% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC payload dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48\%), sensitivity (95.08\%), and specificity (97.54\%). Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D structural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model's strong interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable insights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in targeted cancer therapy development.</description>

      <title>Psychometrics for Hypnopaedia-Aware Machinery via Chaotic Projection of Artificial Mental Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural backdoors represent insidious cybersecurity loopholes that render learning machinery vulnerable to unauthorised manipulations, potentially enabling the weaponisation of artificial intelligence with catastrophic consequences. A backdoor attack involves the clandestine infiltration of a trigger during the learning process, metaphorically analogous to hypnopaedia, where ideas are implanted into a subject's subconscious mind under the state of hypnosis or unconsciousness. When activated by a sensory stimulus, the trigger evokes conditioned reflex that directs a machine to mount a predetermined response. In this study, we propose a cybernetic framework for constant surveillance of backdoors threats, driven by the dynamic nature of untrustworthy data sources. We develop a self-aware unlearning mechanism to autonomously detach a machine's behaviour from the backdoor trigger. Through reverse engineering and statistical inference, we detect deceptive patterns and estimate the likelihood of backdoor infection. We employ model inversion to elicit artificial mental imagery, using stochastic processes to disrupt optimisation pathways and avoid convergent but potentially flawed patterns. This is followed by hypothesis analysis, which estimates the likelihood of each potentially malicious pattern being the true trigger and infers the probability of infection. The primary objective of this study is to maintain a stable state of equilibrium between knowledge fidelity and backdoor vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Hate Speech Detection Using Cross-Platform Social Media Data In English and German Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hate speech has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. Multiple approaches have been developed to detect hate speech using artificial intelligence, but a generalized model is yet unaccomplished. The challenge for hate speech detection as text classification is the cost of obtaining high-quality training data. This study focuses on detecting bilingual hate speech in YouTube comments and measuring the impact of using additional data from other platforms in the performance of the classification model. We examine the value of additional training datasets from cross-platforms for improving the performance of classification models. We also included factors such as content similarity, definition similarity, and common hate words to measure the impact of datasets on performance. Our findings show that adding more similar datasets based on content similarity, hate words, and definitions improves the performance of classification models. The best performance was obtained by combining datasets from YouTube comments, Twitter, and Gab with an F1-score of 0.74 and 0.68 for English and German YouTube comments.</description>

      <title>CaLMFlow: Volterra Flow Matching using Causal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CaLMFlow (Causal Language Models for Flow Matching), a novel framework that casts flow matching as a Volterra integral equation (VIE), leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) for continuous data generation. CaLMFlow enables the direct application of LLMs to learn complex flows by formulating flow matching as a sequence modeling task, bridging discrete language modeling and continuous generative modeling. Our method implements tokenization across space and time, thereby solving a VIE over these domains. This approach enables efficient handling of high-dimensional data and outperforms ODE solver-dependent methods like conditional flow matching (CFM). We demonstrate CaLMFlow's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world data, including single-cell perturbation response prediction, showcasing its ability to incorporate textual context and generalize to unseen conditions. Our results highlight LLM-driven flow matching as a promising paradigm in generative modeling, offering improved scalability, flexibility, and context-awareness.</description>

      <title>AutoDAN-Turbo: A Lifelong Agent for Strategy Self-Exploration to Jailbreak LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.</description>

      <title>How Do Large Language Models Understand Graph Patterns? A Benchmark for Graph Pattern Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Unsupervised Audio-visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised audiovisual speech enhancement (AVSE) approach that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to iteratively estimate clean speech. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervisedgenerative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to developing assurance cases for adversarial robustness and regulatory compliance in large language models (LLMs). Focusing on both natural and code language tasks, we explore the vulnerabilities these models face, including adversarial attacks based on jailbreaking, heuristics, and randomization. We propose a layered framework incorporating guardrails at various stages of LLM deployment, aimed at mitigating these attacks and ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act. Our approach includes a meta-layer for dynamic risk management and reasoning, crucial for addressing the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities. We illustrate our method with two exemplary assurance cases, highlighting how different contexts demand tailored strategies to ensure robust and compliant AI systems.</description>

      <title>Output Scouting: Auditing Large Language Models for Catastrophic Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high profile incidents in which the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) resulted in significant harm to individuals have brought about a growing interest in AI safety. One reason LLM safety issues occur is that models often have at least some non-zero probability of producing harmful outputs. In this work, we explore the following scenario: imagine an AI safety auditor is searching for catastrophic responses from an LLM (e.g. a "yes" responses to "can I fire an employee for being pregnant?"), and is able to query the model a limited number times (e.g. 1000 times). What is a strategy for querying the model that would efficiently find those failure responses? To this end, we propose output scouting: an approach that aims to generate semantically fluent outputs to a given prompt matching any target probability distribution. We then run experiments using two LLMs and find numerous examples of catastrophic responses. We conclude with a discussion that includes advice for practitioners who are looking to implement LLM auditing for catastrophic responses. We also release an open-source toolkit (https://github.com/joaopfonseca/outputscouting) that implements our auditing framework using the Hugging Face transformers library.</description>

Abstract: Large language models are prone to misuse and vulnerable to security threats, raising significant safety and security concerns. The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act seeks to enforce AI robustness in certain contexts, but faces implementation challenges due to the lack of standards, complexity of LLMs and emerging security vulnerabilities. Our research introduces a framework using ontologies, assurance cases, and factsheets to support engineers and stakeholders in understanding and documenting AI system compliance and security regarding adversarial robustness. This approach aims to ensure that LLMs adhere to regulatory standards and are equipped to counter potential threats.</description>

      <title>An Approach To Enhance IoT Security In 6G Networks Through Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication has evolved significantly, with 6G offering groundbreaking capabilities, particularly for IoT. However, the integration of IoT into 6G presents new security challenges, expanding the attack surface due to vulnerabilities introduced by advanced technologies such as open RAN, terahertz (THz) communication, IRS, massive MIMO, and AI. Emerging threats like AI exploitation, virtualization risks, and evolving attacks, including data manipulation and signal interference, further complicate security efforts. As 6G standards are set to be finalized by 2030, work continues to align security measures with technological advances. However, substantial gaps remain in frameworks designed to secure integrated IoT and 6G systems. Our research addresses these challenges by utilizing tree-based machine learning algorithms to manage complex datasets and evaluate feature importance. We apply data balancing techniques to ensure fair attack representation and use SHAP and LIME to improve model transparency. By aligning feature importance with XAI methods and cross-validating for consistency, we boost model accuracy and enhance IoT security within the 6G ecosystem.</description>

      <title>An Intelligent Native Network Slicing Security Architecture Empowered by Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) has transformed the landscape of resource sharing in networks, offering flexibility to support services and applications with highly variable requirements in areas such as the next-generation 5G/6G mobile networks (NGMN), vehicular networks, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and verticals. Although significant research and experimentation have driven the development of network slicing, existing architectures often fall short in intrinsic architectural intelligent security capabilities. This paper proposes an architecture-intelligent security mechanism to improve the NS solutions. We idealized a security-native architecture that deploys intelligent microservices as federated agents based on machine learning, providing intra-slice and architectural operation security for the Slicing Future Internet Infrastructures (SFI2) reference architecture. It is noteworthy that federated learning approaches match the highly distributed modern microservice-based architectures, thus providing a unifying and scalable design choice for NS platforms addressing both service and security. Using ML-Agents and Security Agents, our approach identified Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and intrusion attacks within the slice using generic and non-intrusive telemetry records, achieving an average accuracy of approximately $95.60\%$ in the network slicing architecture and $99.99\%$ for the deployed slice -- intra-slice. This result demonstrates the potential for leveraging architectural operational security and introduces a promising new research direction for network slicing architectures.</description>

      <title>PalmBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Compressed Large Language Models on Mobile Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices is advantageous in scenarios where transmitting data to remote cloud servers is either undesirable due to privacy concerns or impractical due to network connection. Recent advancements (MLC, 2023a; Gerganov, 2023) have facilitated the local deployment of LLMs. However, local deployment also presents challenges, particularly in balancing quality (generative performance), latency, and throughput within the hardware constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce our lightweight, all-in-one automated benchmarking framework that allows users to evaluate LLMs on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of various popular LLMs with different quantization configurations (both weights and activations) across multiple mobile platforms with varying hardware capabilities. Unlike traditional benchmarks that assess full-scale models on high-end GPU clusters, we focus on evaluating resource efficiency (memory and power consumption) and harmful output for compressed models on mobile devices. Our key observations include i) differences in energy efficiency and throughput across mobile platforms; ii) the impact of quantization on memory usage, GPU execution time, and power consumption; and iii) accuracy and performance degradation of quantized models compared to their non-quantized counterparts; and iv) the frequency of hallucinations and toxic content generated by compressed LLMs on mobile devices.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.</description>

      <title>Improving LLM Reasoning through Scaling Inference Computation with Collaborative Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the general capability of large language models (LLMs), they continue to struggle with consistent and accurate reasoning, especially in complex tasks such as mathematical and code reasoning. One key limitation is that LLMs are trained primarily on correct solutions, reducing their ability to detect and learn from errors, which hampers their ability to reliably verify and rank outputs. To address this, we scale up the inference-time computation by generating multiple reasoning paths and employing verifiers to assess and rank the generated outputs by correctness. To facilitate this, we introduce a comprehensive dataset consisting of correct and incorrect solutions for math and code tasks, generated by multiple LLMs. This diverse set of solutions enables verifiers to more effectively distinguish and rank correct answers from erroneous outputs. The training methods for building verifiers were selected based on an extensive comparison of existing approaches. Moreover, to leverage the unique strengths of different reasoning strategies, we propose a novel collaborative method integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) solutions for verification. CoT provides a clear, step-by-step reasoning process that enhances interpretability, while PoT, being executable, offers a precise and error-sensitive validation mechanism. By taking both of their strengths, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of reasoning verification. Our verifiers, Math-Rev and Code-Rev, demonstrate substantial performance gains to existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as GSM8k and MATH and even outperforming GPT-4o with Qwen-72B-Instruct as the reasoner.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces to a structured application of the One-Class approach and the One-Class-One-Network model for supervised classification tasks, specifically addressing a vowel phonemes classification case study within the Automatic Speech Recognition research field. Through pseudo-Neural Architecture Search and Hyper-Parameters Tuning experiments conducted with an informed grid-search methodology, we achieve classification accuracy comparable to nowadays complex architectures (90.0 - 93.7%). Despite its simplicity, our model prioritizes generalization of language context and distributed applicability, supported by relevant statistical and performance metrics.

      <title>From Incomplete Coarse-Grained to Complete Fine-Grained: A Two-Stage Framework for Spatiotemporal Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of various sensing devices, spatiotemporal data is becoming increasingly important nowadays. However, due to sensing costs and privacy concerns, the collected data is often incomplete and coarse-grained, limiting its application to specific tasks. To address this, we propose a new task called spatiotemporal data reconstruction, which aims to infer complete and fine-grained data from sparse and coarse-grained observations. To achieve this, we introduce a two-stage data inference framework, DiffRecon, grounded in the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). In the first stage, we present Diffusion-C, a diffusion model augmented by ST-PointFormer, a powerful encoder designed to leverage the spatial correlations between sparse data points. Following this, the second stage introduces Diffusion-F, which incorporates the proposed T-PatternNet to capture the temporal pattern within sequential data. Together, these two stages form an end-to-end framework capable of inferring complete, fine-grained data from incomplete and coarse-grained observations. We conducted experiments on multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Reward Learning From Preference With Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward learning plays a pivotal role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), ensuring the alignment of language models. The Bradley-Terry (BT) model stands as the prevalent choice for capturing human preferences from datasets containing pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In preference modeling, the focus is not on absolute values but rather on the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses, referred to as preference strength. Thus, precise evaluation of preference strength holds paramount importance in preference modeling. However, an easily overlooked factor significantly affecting preference strength measurement is that human attitudes towards two responses may not solely indicate a preference for one over the other and ties are also a common occurrence. To address this, we propose the adoption of the generalized Bradley-Terry model -- the Bradley-Terry model with ties (BTT) -- to accommodate tied preferences, thus leveraging additional information. We prove that even with the access to the true distributions of prompt and response, disregarding ties can lead to a notable bias in preference strength measurement. Comprehensive experiments further validate the advantages of incorporating ties in preference modeling. Notably, fine-tuning with BTT significantly outperforms fine-tuning with BT on synthetic preference datasets with ties, labeled by state-of-the-art open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Taylor Unswift: Secured Weight Release for Large Language Models via Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</description>

      <title>Distributed Inference on Mobile Edge and Cloud: An Early Exit based Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various domains. However, their large size is a challenge for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile, edge, and IoT platforms. To overcome this, a distributed inference setup can be used where a small-sized DNN (initial few layers) can be deployed on mobile, a bigger version on the edge, and the full-fledged, on the cloud. A sample that has low complexity (easy) could be then inferred on mobile, that has moderate complexity (medium) on edge, and higher complexity (hard) on the cloud. As the complexity of each sample is not known beforehand, the following question arises in distributed inference: how to decide complexity so that it is processed by enough layers of DNNs. We develop a novel approach named DIMEE that utilizes Early Exit (EE) strategies developed to minimize inference latency in DNNs. DIMEE aims to improve the accuracy, taking into account the offloading cost from mobile to edge/cloud. Experimental validation on GLUE datasets, encompassing various NLP tasks, shows that our method significantly reduces the inference cost (&gt; 43%) while maintaining a minimal drop in accuracy (&lt; 0.3%) compared to the case where all the inference is made in cloud.</description>

      <title>NeuroBOLT: Resting-state EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an indispensable tool in modern neuroscience, providing a non-invasive window into whole-brain dynamics at millimeter-scale spatial resolution. However, fMRI is constrained by issues such as high operation costs and immobility. With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly advancing the integration of these two modalities.</description>

      <title>EgoOops: A Dataset for Mistake Action Detection from Egocentric Videos with Procedural Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mistake action detection from egocentric videos is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Previous studies have been limited to specific domains, focused on detecting mistakes from videos without procedural texts, and analyzed whether actions are mistakes. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the EgoOops dataset, which includes egocentric videos, procedural texts, and three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. EgoOops covers five procedural domains and includes 50 egocentric videos. The video-text alignment allows the model to detect mistakes based on both videos and procedural texts. The mistake labels and descriptions enable detailed analysis of real-world mistakes. Based on EgoOops, we tackle two tasks: video-text alignment and mistake detection. For video-text alignment, we enhance the recent StepFormer model with an additional loss for fine-tuning. Based on the alignment results, we propose a multi-modal classifier to predict mistake labels. In our experiments, the proposed methods achieve higher performance than the baselines. In addition, our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining videos and texts. We will release the dataset and codes upon publication.</description>

      <title>Trained Models Tell Us How to Make Them Robust to Spurious Correlation without Group Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifiers trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tend to rely on attributes that have high spurious correlation with the target. This can degrade the performance on underrepresented (or 'minority') groups that lack these attributes, posing significant challenges for both out-of-distribution generalization and fairness objectives. Many studies aim to enhance robustness to spurious correlation, but they sometimes depend on group annotations for training. Additionally, a common limitation in previous research is the reliance on group-annotated validation datasets for model selection. This constrains their applicability in situations where the nature of the spurious correlation is not known, or when group labels for certain spurious attributes are not available. To enhance model robustness with minimal group annotation assumptions, we propose Environment-based Validation and Loss-based Sampling (EVaLS). It uses the losses from an ERM-trained model to construct a balanced dataset of high-loss and low-loss samples, mitigating group imbalance in data. This significantly enhances robustness to group shifts when equipped with a simple post-training last layer retraining. By using environment inference methods to create diverse environments with correlation shifts, EVaLS can potentially eliminate the need for group annotation in validation data. In this context, the worst environment accuracy acts as a reliable surrogate throughout the retraining process for tuning hyperparameters and finding a model that performs well across diverse group shifts. EVaLS effectively achieves group robustness, showing that group annotation is not necessary even for validation. It is a fast, straightforward, and effective approach that reaches near-optimal worst group accuracy without needing group annotations, marking a new chapter in the robustness of trained models against spurious correlation.</description>

      <title>AnyAttack: Towards Large-scale Self-supervised Generation of Targeted Adversarial Examples for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have found numerous impactful applications in real-world scenarios. However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. To address the limitation of existing methods that require label supervision, we introduce a contrastive loss that trains a generator on a large-scale unlabeled image dataset, LAION-400M dataset, for generating targeted adversarial noise. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google's Gemini, Claude's Sonnet, and Microsoft's Copilot. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.</description>

      <title>ResTNet: Defense against Adversarial Policies via Transformer in Computer Go</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although AlphaZero has achieved superhuman levels in Go, recent research has highlighted its vulnerability in particular situations requiring a more comprehensive understanding of the entire board. To address this challenge, this paper introduces ResTNet, a network that interleaves residual networks and Transformer. Our empirical experiments demonstrate several advantages of using ResTNet. First, it not only improves playing strength but also enhances the ability of global information. Second, it defends against an adversary Go program, called cyclic-adversary, tailor-made for attacking AlphaZero algorithms, significantly reducing the average probability of being attacked rate from 70.44% to 23.91%. Third, it improves the accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01% in correctly recognizing ladder patterns, which are one of the challenging patterns for Go AIs. Finally, ResTNet offers a potential explanation of the decision-making process and can also be applied to other games like Hex. To the best of our knowledge, ResTNet is the first to integrate residual networks and Transformer in the context of AlphaZero for board games, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing AlphaZero's global understanding.</description>

Abstract: Advanced AI applications have become increasingly available to a broad audience, e.g., as centrally managed large language models (LLMs). Such centralization is both a risk and a performance bottleneck - Edge AI promises to be a solution to these problems. However, its decentralized approach raises additional challenges regarding security and safety. In this paper, we argue that both of these aspects are critical for Edge AI, and even more so, their integration. Concretely, we survey security and safety threats, summarize existing countermeasures, and collect open challenges as a call for more research in this area.</description>

      <title>Towards the generation of hierarchical attack models from cybersecurity vulnerabilities using language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of a pre-trained language model and siamese network to discern sibling relationships between text-based cybersecurity vulnerability data. The ultimate purpose of the approach presented in this paper is towards the construction of hierarchical attack models based on a set of text descriptions characterising potential/observed vulnerabilities in a given system. Due to the nature of the data, and the uncertainty sensitive environment in which the problem is presented, a practically oriented soft computing approach is necessary. Therefore, a key focus of this work is to investigate practical questions surrounding the reliability of predicted links towards the construction of such models, to which end conceptual and practical challenges and solutions associated with the proposed approach are outlined, such as dataset complexity and stability of predictions. Accordingly, the contributions of this paper focus on producing neural networks using a pre-trained language model for predicting sibling relationships between cybersecurity vulnerabilities, then outlining how to apply this capability towards the generation of hierarchical attack models. In addition, two data sampling mechanisms for tackling data complexity, and a consensus mechanism for reducing the amount of false positive predictions are outlined. Each of these approaches is compared and contrasted using empirical results from three sets of cybersecurity data to determine their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances of Multimodal Continual Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05352</link>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to empower machine learning models to learn continually from new data, while building upon previously acquired knowledge without forgetting. As machine learning models have evolved from small to large pre-trained architectures, and from supporting unimodal to multimodal data, multimodal continual learning (MMCL) methods have recently emerged. The primary challenge of MMCL is that it goes beyond a simple stacking of unimodal CL methods, as such straightforward approaches often yield unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survey on MMCL. We provide essential background knowledge and MMCL settings, as well as a structured taxonomy of MMCL methods. We categorize existing MMCL methods into four categories, i.e., regularization-based, architecture-based, replay-based, and prompt-based methods, explaining their methodologies and highlighting their key innovations. Additionally, to prompt further research in this field, we summarize open MMCL datasets and benchmarks, and discuss several promising future directions for investigation and development. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant MMCL papers and open resources available at https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning.</description>

      <title>Towards a Categorical Foundation of Deep Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of machine learning research has lead to incredible advances, but also poses hard challenges. At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible.
  This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems.
  In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Federated Learning in Cell-Free MIMO with Long-term Power Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless networks supporting artificial intelligence have gained significant attention, with Over-the-Air Federated Learning emerging as a key application due to its unique transmission and distributed computing characteristics. This paper derives error bounds for Over-the-Air Federated Learning in a Cell-free MIMO system and formulates an optimization problem to minimize optimality gap via joint optimization of power control and beamforming. We introduce the MOP-LOFPC algorithm, which employs Lyapunov optimization to decouple long-term constraints across rounds while requiring only causal channel state information. Experimental results demonstrate that MOP-LOFPC achieves a better and more flexible trade-off between the model's training loss and adherence to long-term power constraints compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Falcon Mamba: The First Competitive Attention-free 7B Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this technical report, we present Falcon Mamba 7B, a new base large language model based on the novel Mamba architecture. Falcon Mamba 7B is trained on 5.8 trillion tokens with carefully selected data mixtures. As a pure Mamba-based model, Falcon Mamba 7B surpasses leading open-weight models based on Transformers, such as Mistral 7B, Llama3.1 8B, and Falcon2 11B. It is on par with Gemma 7B and outperforms models with different architecture designs, such as RecurrentGemma 9B and RWKV-v6 Finch 7B/14B. Currently, Falcon Mamba 7B is the best-performing Mamba model in the literature at this scale, surpassing both existing Mamba and hybrid Mamba-Transformer models, according to the Open LLM Leaderboard. Due to its architecture, Falcon Mamba 7B is significantly faster at inference and requires substantially less memory for long sequence generation. Despite recent studies suggesting that hybrid Mamba-Transformer models outperform pure architecture designs, we demonstrate that even the pure Mamba design can achieve similar, or even superior results compared to the Transformer and hybrid designs. We make the weights of our implementation of Falcon Mamba 7B publicly available on https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-mamba-7b, under a permissive license.</description>

      <title>BSG4Bot: Efficient Bot Detection based on Biased Heterogeneous Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of malicious social bots has become a crucial task, as bots can be easily deployed and manipulated to spread disinformation, promote conspiracy messages, and more. Most existing approaches utilize graph neural networks (GNNs)to capture both user profle and structural features,achieving promising progress. However, they still face limitations including the expensive training on large underlying graph, the performance degration when similar neighborhood patterns' assumption preferred by GNNs is not satisfied, and the dynamic features of bots in a highly adversarial context. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method named BSG4Bot with an intuition that GNNs training on Biased SubGraphs can improve both performance and time/space efficiency in bot detection. Specifically, BSG4Bot first pre-trains a classifier on node features efficiently to define the node similarities, and constructs biased subgraphs by combining the similarities computed by the pre-trained classifier and the node importances computed by Personalized PageRank (PPR scores). BSG4Bot then introduces a heterogeneous GNN over the constructed subgraphs to detect bots effectively and efficiently. The relatively stable features, including the content category and temporal activity features, are explored and incorporated into BSG4Bot after preliminary verification on sample data. The extensive experimental studies show that BSG4Bot outperforms the state-of-the-art bot detection methods, while only needing nearly 1/5 training time.</description>

      <title>Model-GLUE: Democratized LLM Scaling for A Large Model Zoo in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across tasks and specialized domains, scaling LLMs based on existing models has garnered significant attention, which faces the challenge of decreasing performance when combining disparate models. Various techniques have been proposed for the aggregation of pre-trained LLMs, including model merging, Mixture-of-Experts, and stacking. Despite their merits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a diverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research gap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First, our work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques, especially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights from the benchmark results, we formulate an strategy for the selection and aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different architectures and initialization. Our methodology involves the clustering of mergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of clusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a diverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance enhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

      <title>RespLLM: Unifying Audio and Text with Multimodal LLMs for Generalized Respiratory Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high incidence and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases underscores the importance of early screening. Machine learning models can automate clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However, the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion techniques, and task-specific models. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions. Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources, ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of 4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive, listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory health diagnosis.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are In-Context Reinforcement Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn new tasks through in-context supervised learning (i.e., ICL). This work studies if this ability extends to in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models are not given gold labels in context, but only their past predictions and rewards. We show that a naive application of ICRL fails miserably, and identify the root cause as a fundamental deficiency at exploration, which leads to quick model degeneration. We propose an algorithm to address this deficiency by increasing test-time compute, as well as a compute-bound approximation. We use several challenging classification tasks to empirically show that our ICRL algorithms lead to effective learning from rewards alone, and analyze the characteristics of this ability and our methods. Overall, our results reveal remarkable ICRL abilities in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: We propose Diffusion Model Predictive Control (D-MPC), a novel MPC approach that learns a multi-step action proposal and a multi-step dynamics model, both using diffusion models, and combines them for use in online MPC. On the popular D4RL benchmark, we show performance that is significantly better than existing model-based offline planning methods using MPC and competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods. We additionally illustrate D-MPC's ability to optimize novel reward functions at run time and adapt to novel dynamics, and highlight its advantages compared to existing diffusion-based planning baselines.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>

      <title>Improving Predictor Reliability with Selective Recalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable deep learning system should be able to accurately express its confidence with respect to its predictions, a quality known as calibration. One of the most effective ways to produce reliable confidence estimates with a pre-trained model is by applying a post-hoc recalibration method. Popular recalibration methods like temperature scaling are typically fit on a small amount of data and work in the model's output space, as opposed to the more expressive feature embedding space, and thus usually have only one or a handful of parameters. However, the target distribution to which they are applied is often complex and difficult to fit well with such a function. To this end we propose \textit{selective recalibration}, where a selection model learns to reject some user-chosen proportion of the data in order to allow the recalibrator to focus on regions of the input space that can be well-captured by such a model. We provide theoretical analysis to motivate our algorithm, and test our method through comprehensive experiments on difficult medical imaging and zero-shot classification tasks. Our results show that selective recalibration consistently leads to significantly lower calibration error than a wide range of selection and recalibration baselines.</description>

      <title>Refining Counterfactual Explanations With Joint-Distribution-Informed Shapley Towards Actionable Minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CE) identify data points that closely resemble the observed data but produce different machine learning (ML) model outputs, offering critical insights into model decisions. Despite the diverse scenarios, goals and tasks to which they are tailored, existing CE methods often lack actionable efficiency because of unnecessary feature changes included within the explanations that are presented to users and stakeholders. We address this problem by proposing a method that minimizes the required feature changes while maintaining the validity of CE, without imposing restrictions on models or CE algorithms, whether instance- or group-based. The key innovation lies in computing a joint distribution between observed and counterfactual data and leveraging it to inform Shapley values for feature attributions (FA). We demonstrate that optimal transport (OT) effectively derives this distribution, especially when the alignment between observed and counterfactual data is unclear in used CE methods. Additionally, a counterintuitive finding is uncovered: it may be misleading to rely on an exact alignment defined by the CE generation mechanism in conducting FA. Our proposed method is validated on extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in refining CE towards greater actionable efficiency.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Talker Identity Aids With Improving Speech Recognition in Adversarial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art speech recognition models are trained to map acoustic signals into sub-lexical units. While these models demonstrate superior performance, they remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution conditions such as background noise and speech augmentations. In this work, we hypothesize that incorporating speaker representations during speech recognition can enhance model robustness to noise. We developed a transformer-based model that jointly performs speech recognition and speaker identification. Our model utilizes speech embeddings from Whisper and speaker embeddings from ECAPA-TDNN, which are processed jointly to perform both tasks. We show that the joint model performs comparably to Whisper under clean conditions. Notably, the joint model outperforms Whisper in high-noise environments, such as with 8-speaker babble background noise. Furthermore, our joint model excels in handling highly augmented speech, including sine-wave and noise-vocoded speech. Overall, these results suggest that integrating voice representations with speech recognition can lead to more robust models under adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>Better than Your Teacher: LLM Agents that learn from Privileged AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show impressive decision-making abilities, current methods lack a mechanism for automatic self-improvement from errors during task execution. We propose LEAP, an iterative fine-tuning framework that continually improves LLM agents using feedback from AI expert teachers. Our key insight is to equip the expert teachers with a privileged state -- information that is available during training but hidden at test time. This allows even weak experts to provide precise guidance, significantly improving the student agent's performance without access to privileged information at test time. We evaluate LEAP on diverse decision-making benchmarks, including text-based games (ALFWorld), web navigation (WebShop), and interactive coding (Intercode Bash). Our experiments show that LEAP (1) outperforms behavior cloning and ReAct baselines (2) enables weak student models (e.g., Llama3-8B) to exceed the performance of strong teacher models (GPT4-o), and (3) allows weak models to self-improve using privileged versions of themselves. We also provide a theoretical analysis showing that LEAP's success hinges on balancing privileged information with the student's realizability, which we empirically validate.

      <title>AI-Driven Early Mental Health Screening with Limited Data: Analyzing Selfies of Pregnant Women</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety disorders affect millions globally, contributing significantly to the burden of mental health issues. Early screening is crucial for effective intervention, as timely identification of mental health issues can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable for improving the screening of mental disorders, enabling early intervention and better treatment outcomes. AI-driven screening can leverage the analysis of multiple data sources, including facial features in digital images. However, existing methods often rely on controlled environments or specialized equipment, limiting their broad applicability. This study explores the potential of AI models for ubiquitous depression-anxiety screening given face-centric selfies. The investigation focuses on high-risk pregnant patients, a population that is particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. To cope with limited training data resulting from our clinical setup, pre-trained models were utilized in two different approaches: fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) originally designed for facial expression recognition and employing vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of facial expressions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed VLM-based method significantly outperforms CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 77.6% and an F1-score of 56.0%. Although there is significant room for improvement, the results suggest that VLMs can be a promising approach for mental health screening, especially in scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <title>Herd Mentality in Augmentation -- Not a Good Idea! A Robust Multi-stage Approach towards Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid increase in deepfake technology has raised significant concerns about digital media integrity. Detecting deepfakes is crucial for safeguarding digital media. However, most standard image classifiers fail to distinguish between fake and real faces. Our analysis reveals that this failure is due to the model's inability to explicitly focus on the artefacts typically in deepfakes. We propose an enhanced architecture based on the GenConViT model, which incorporates weighted loss and update augmentation techniques and includes masked eye pretraining. This proposed model improves the F1 score by 1.71% and the accuracy by 4.34% on the Celeb-DF v2 dataset. The source code for our model is available at https://github.com/Monu-Khicher-1/multi-stage-learning</description>

      <title>Image Watermarks are Removable Using Controllable Regeneration from Clean Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image watermark techniques provide an effective way to assert ownership, deter misuse, and trace content sources, which has become increasingly essential in the era of large generative models. A critical attribute of watermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this paper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively nullifying the state of the art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight involves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian noise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and spatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Decoded: Targeted and Robust Analysis of Neural Network Decisions via Causal Explanations and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their success and widespread adoption, the opaque nature of deep neural networks (DNNs) continues to hinder trust, especially in critical applications. Current interpretability solutions often yield inconsistent or oversimplified explanations, or require model changes that compromise performance. In this work, we introduce TRACER, a novel method grounded in causal inference theory designed to estimate the causal dynamics underpinning DNN decisions without altering their architecture or compromising their performance. Our approach systematically intervenes on input features to observe how specific changes propagate through the network, affecting internal activations and final outputs. Based on this analysis, we determine the importance of individual features, and construct a high-level causal map by grouping functionally similar layers into cohesive causal nodes, providing a structured and interpretable view of how different parts of the network influence the decisions. TRACER further enhances explainability by generating counterfactuals that reveal possible model biases and offer contrastive explanations for misclassifications. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets, we demonstrate TRACER's effectiveness over existing methods and show its potential for creating highly compressed yet accurate models, illustrating its dual versatility in both understanding and optimizing DNNs.</description>

      <title>Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Enhanced Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the strong performance in many computer vision tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can sometimes struggle to efficiently capture long-range, complex non-linear dependencies in deeper layers of the network. We address this limitation by introducing Residual KAN, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) within the CNN framework as a residual component. Our approach uses Chebyshev polynomials as the basis for KAN convolutions that enables more expressive and adaptive feature representations while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed RKAN blocks, when integrated into established architectures such as ResNet and DenseNet, offer consistent improvements over the baseline models on various well-known benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the potential of RKAN to enhance the capabilities of deep CNNs in visual data.</description>

      <title>Toward General Object-level Mapping from Sparse Views with 3D Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-level mapping builds a 3D map of objects in a scene with detailed shapes and poses from multi-view sensor observations. Conventional methods struggle to build complete shapes and estimate accurate poses due to partial occlusions and sensor noise. They require dense observations to cover all objects, which is challenging to achieve in robotics trajectories. Recent work introduces generative shape priors for object-level mapping from sparse views, but is limited to single-category objects. In this work, we propose a General Object-level Mapping system, GOM, which leverages a 3D diffusion model as shape prior with multi-category support and outputs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for both texture and geometry for all objects in a scene. GOM includes an effective formulation to guide a pre-trained diffusion model with extra nonlinear constraints from sensor measurements without finetuning. We also develop a probabilistic optimization formulation to fuse multi-view sensor observations and diffusion priors for joint 3D object pose and shape estimation. Our GOM system demonstrates superior multi-category mapping performance from sparse views, and achieves more accurate mapping results compared to state-of-the-art methods on the real-world benchmarks. We will release our code: https://github.com/TRAILab/GeneralObjectMapping.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Tensor Computation Graphs with Equality Saturation and Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-world effectiveness of deep neural networks often depends on their latency, thereby necessitating optimization techniques that can reduce a model's inference time while preserving its performance. One popular approach is to sequentially rewrite the input computation graph into an equivalent but faster one by replacing individual subgraphs. This approach gives rise to the so-called phase-ordering problem in which the application of one rewrite rule can eliminate the possibility to apply an even better one later on. Recent work has shown that equality saturation, a technique from compiler optimization, can mitigate this issue by first building an intermediate representation (IR) that efficiently stores multiple optimized versions of the input program before extracting the best solution in a second step. In practice, however, memory constraints prevent the IR from capturing all optimized versions and thus reintroduce the phase-ordering problem in the construction phase. In this paper, we present a tensor graph rewriting approach that uses Monte Carlo tree search to build superior IRs by identifying the most promising rewrite rules. We also introduce a novel extraction algorithm that can provide fast and accurate runtime estimates of tensor programs represented in an IR. Our approach improves the inference speedup of neural networks by up to 11% compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>On Feature Decorrelation in Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) poses a significant challenge in computer vision. A prevailing approach is to prompt models to concentrate on causal attributes, like facial features and hairstyles, rather than confounding elements such as clothing appearance. Traditional methods to achieve this involve integrating multi-modality data or employing manually annotated clothing labels, which tend to complicate the model and require extensive human effort. In our study, we demonstrate that simply reducing feature correlations during training can significantly enhance the baseline model's performance. We theoretically elucidate this effect and introduce a novel regularization technique based on density ratio estimation. This technique aims to minimize feature correlation in the training process of cloth-changing ReID baselines. Our approach is model-independent, offering broad enhancements without needing additional data or labels. We validate our method through comprehensive experiments on prevalent CC-ReID datasets, showing its effectiveness in improving baseline models' generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Online Dynamic Pricing for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations with Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs), coupled with the rise of renewable energy sources, will significantly impact the electric grid. Unlike conventional fuel sources, electricity for EVs is constrained by grid capacity, price fluctuations, and long EV charging times, requiring new pricing solutions to manage demand and supply. This paper proposes a model for online dynamic pricing of reserved EV charging services, including reservation, parking, and charging as a bundled service priced as a whole. Our approach focuses on the individual charging station operator, employing a stochastic demand model and online dynamic pricing based on expected demand. The proposed model uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation to optimize sequential pricing decisions for charging session requests. A key contribution is the novel definition and quantification of discretization error introduced by the discretization of the Poisson process for use in the MDP. The model's viability is demonstrated with a heuristic solution method based on Monte-Carlo tree search, offering a viable path for real-world application.</description>

      <title>On Instruction-Finetuning Neural Machine Translation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce instruction finetuning for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, which distills instruction following capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs) into orders-of-magnitude smaller NMT models. Our instruction-finetuning recipe for NMT models enables customization of translations for a limited but disparate set of translation-specific tasks. We show that NMT models are capable of following multiple instructions simultaneously and demonstrate capabilities of zero-shot composition of instructions. We also show that through instruction finetuning, traditionally disparate tasks such as formality-controlled machine translation, multi-domain adaptation as well as multi-modal translations can be tackled jointly by a single instruction finetuned NMT model, at a performance level comparable to LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to demonstrate the instruction-following capabilities of traditional NMT models, which allows for faster, cheaper and more efficient serving of customized translations.</description>

      <title>Narrative-of-Thought: Improving Temporal Reasoning of Large Language Models via Recounted Narratives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about time and temporal relations is an integral aspect of human cognition, essential for perceiving the world and navigating our experiences. Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in many reasoning tasks, temporal reasoning remains challenging due to its intrinsic complexity. In this work, we first study an essential task of temporal reasoning -- temporal graph generation, to unveil LLMs' inherent, global reasoning capabilities. We show that this task presents great challenges even for the most powerful LLMs, such as GPT-3.5/4. We also notice a significant performance gap by small models (&lt;10B) that lag behind LLMs by 50%. Next, we study how to close this gap with a budget constraint, e.g., not using model finetuning. We propose a new prompting technique tailored for temporal reasoning, Narrative-of-Thought (NoT), that first converts the events set to a Python class, then prompts a small model to generate a temporally grounded narrative, guiding the final generation of a temporal graph. Extensive experiments showcase the efficacy of NoT in improving various metrics. Notably, NoT attains the highest F1 on the Schema-11 evaluation set, while securing an overall F1 on par with GPT-3.5. NoT also achieves the best structural similarity across the board, even compared with GPT-3.5/4. Our code is available at https://github.com/launchnlp/NoT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems remains a formidable challenge due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and the inherent limitations of traditional data-driven modeling approaches. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging the recently proposed multi-step penalty (MP) optimization technique. Our approach extends the applicability of MP optimization to a wide range of deep learning architectures, including Fourier Neural Operators and UNETs. By introducing penalized local discontinuities in the forecast trajectory, we effectively handle the non-convexity of loss landscapes commonly encountered in training neural networks for chaotic systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through its application to two challenging use-cases: the prediction of flow velocity evolution in two-dimensional turbulence and ocean dynamics using reanalysis data. Our results highlight the potential of this approach for accurate and stable long-term prediction of chaotic dynamics, paving the way for new advancements in data-driven modeling of complex natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>TaeBench: Improving Quality of Toxic Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services. Our experiments also show that TaeBench with adversarial training achieve significant improvements of the robustness of two toxicity detectors.</description>

Abstract: Automatic refinement of patent claims in patent applications is crucial from the perspective of intellectual property strategy. In this paper, we propose ClaimBrush, a novel framework for automated patent claim refinement that includes a dataset and a rewriting model. We constructed a dataset for training and evaluating patent claim rewriting models by collecting a large number of actual patent claim rewriting cases from the patent examination process. Using the constructed dataset, we built an automatic patent claim rewriting model by fine-tuning a large language model. Furthermore, we enhanced the performance of the automatic patent claim rewriting model by applying preference optimization based on a prediction model of patent examiners' Office Actions. The experimental results showed that our proposed rewriting model outperformed heuristic baselines and zero-shot learning in state-of-the-art large language models. Moreover, preference optimization based on patent examiners' preferences boosted the performance of patent claim refinement.</description>

      <title>Swift Sampler: Efficient Learning of Sampler by 10 Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data selection is essential for training deep learning models. An effective data sampler assigns proper sampling probability for training data and helps the model converge to a good local minimum with high performance. Previous studies in data sampling are mainly based on heuristic rules or learning through a huge amount of time-consuming trials. In this paper, we propose an automatic \textbf{swift sampler} search algorithm, \textbf{SS}, to explore automatically learning effective samplers efficiently. In particular, \textbf{SS} utilizes a novel formulation to map a sampler to a low dimension of hyper-parameters and uses an approximated local minimum to quickly examine the quality of a sampler. Benefiting from its low computational expense, \textbf{SS} can be applied on large-scale data sets with high efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that \textbf{SS} powered sampling can achieve obvious improvements (e.g., 1.5\% on ImageNet) and transfer among different neural networks.

      <title>Adaptation Odyssey in LLMs: Why Does Additional Pretraining Sometimes Fail to Improve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the generalization and adaptation abilities of deep learning models were typically evaluated on fixed training and test distributions. Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</description>

      <title>NegMerge: Consensual Weight Negation for Strong Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove specific knowledge from a model. Current methods, such as task arithmetic, rely on fine-tuning models on the forget set, generating a task vector, and subtracting it from the original model. However, we argue the effectiveness of this approach is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, necessitating careful validation to identify the best model among many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages all given fine-tuned models rather than selecting a single one. By constructing task vectors from models trained with varied hyperparameters and merging only the components of the task vectors with consistent signs, we perform unlearning by negating the merged task vector from the original model. Given that existing methods also utilize multiple fine-tuned models, our approach delivers more effective unlearning without incurring additional computational costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both vision-language models and standard image classification models, showing improved unlearning performance with minimal degradation on the retain set, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of Regressional Goodhart's effect, we identify the existence of exogenous variables impacting the relationship between RM quality measured by accuracy and policy model capability. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 50% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</description>

      <title>TeaserGen: Generating Teasers for Long Documentaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teasers are an effective tool for promoting content in entertainment, commercial and educational fields. However, creating an effective teaser for long videos is challenging for it requires long-range multimodal modeling on the input videos, while necessitating maintaining audiovisual alignments, managing scene changes and preserving factual accuracy for the output teasers. Due to the lack of a publicly-available dataset, progress along this research direction has been hindered. In this work, we present DocumentaryNet, a collection of 1,269 documentaries paired with their teasers, featuring multimodal data streams of video, speech, music, sound effects and narrations. With DocumentaryNet, we propose a new two-stage system for generating teasers from long documentaries. The proposed TeaserGen system first generates the teaser narration from the transcribed narration of the documentary using a pretrained large language model, and then selects the most relevant visual content to accompany the generated narration through language-vision models. For narration-video matching, we explore two approaches: a pretraining-based model using pretrained contrastive language-vision models and a deep sequential model that learns the mapping between the narrations and visuals. Our experimental results show that the pretraining-based approach is more effective at identifying relevant visual content than directly trained deep autoregressive models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are pervasive in many science and engineering fields, yet standard neural ODE approaches struggle to learn them. This limitation is the main barrier to the widespread adoption of neural ODEs. In this paper, we propose an approach based on single-step implicit schemes to enable neural ODEs to handle stiffness and demonstrate that our implicit neural ODE method can learn stiff dynamics. This work addresses a key limitation in current neural ODE methods, paving the way for their use in a wider range of scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Everything Everywhere All at Once: LLMs can In-Context Learn Multiple Tasks in Superposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this study, we explore a surprising phenomenon related to ICL: LLMs can perform multiple, computationally distinct ICL tasks simultaneously, during a single inference call, a capability we term "task superposition". We provide empirical evidence of this phenomenon across various LLM families and scales and show that this phenomenon emerges even if we train the model to in-context learn one task at a time. We offer theoretical explanations that this capability is well within the expressive power of transformers. We also explore how LLMs internally compose task vectors during superposition. Furthermore, we show that larger models can solve more ICL tasks in parallel, and better calibrate their output distribution. Our findings offer insights into the latent capabilities of LLMs, further substantiate the perspective of "LLMs as superposition of simulators", and raise questions about the mechanisms enabling simultaneous task execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry has shown promising performance in molecular understanding tasks, such as generating a text description from a molecule. However, proper reasoning based on molecular structural information remains a significant challenge, e.g., even advanced LLMs such as GPT-4o struggle to identify functional groups which are crucial for inferring the molecular property of interest. To address this limitation, we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.</description>

Abstract: The Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification, which builds decision trees iteratively to minimize prediction errors. This document explains the GBC's training and prediction processes, focusing on the computation of terminal node values $\gamma_j$, which are crucial to optimizing the logistic loss function. We derive $\gamma_j$ through a Taylor series approximation and provide a step-by-step pseudocode for the algorithm's implementation. The guide explains the theory of GBC and its practical application, demonstrating its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. We provide a step-by-step example in the appendix to help readers understand.</description>

      <title>CLOSER: Towards Better Representation Learning for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming to incrementally learn new classes with only few samples while preserving the knowledge of base (old) classes, few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) faces several challenges, such as overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Such a challenging problem is often tackled by fixing a feature extractor trained on base classes to reduce the adverse effects of overfitting and forgetting. Under such formulation, our primary focus is representation learning on base classes to tackle the unique challenge of FSCIL: simultaneously achieving the transferability and the discriminability of the learned representation. Building upon the recent efforts for enhancing transferability, such as promoting the spread of features, we find that trying to secure the spread of features within a more confined feature space enables the learned representation to strike a better balance between transferability and discriminability. Thus, in stark contrast to prior beliefs that the inter-class distance should be maximized, we claim that the closer different classes are, the better for FSCIL. The empirical results and analysis from the perspective of information bottleneck theory justify our simple yet seemingly counter-intuitive representation learning method, raising research questions and suggesting alternative research directions.

      <description>arXiv:2410.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities on textual data. We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are effective for modeling event occurrences over time, but they struggle with sparse and uncertain events in federated systems, where privacy is a major concern. To address this, we propose \textit{FedPP}, a Federated neural nonparametric Point Process model. FedPP integrates neural embeddings into Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox Processes (SGCPs) on the client side, which is a flexible and expressive class of TPPs, allowing it to generate highly flexible intensity functions that capture client-specific event dynamics and uncertainties while efficiently summarizing historical records. For global aggregation, FedPP introduces a divergence-based mechanism that communicates the distributions of SGCPs' kernel hyperparameters between the server and clients, while keeping client-specific parameters local to ensure privacy and personalization. FedPP effectively captures event uncertainty and sparsity, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in federated settings, particularly with KL divergence and Wasserstein distance-based global aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems sample from the posterior using score functions and accept the generated random samples as solutions. In applications that posterior mean is preferred, we have to generate multiple samples from the posterior which is time-consuming. In this work, by analyzing the probability density evolution of the conditional reverse diffusion process, we prove that the posterior mean can be achieved by tracking the mean of each reverse diffusion step. Based on that, we establish a framework termed reverse mean propagation (RMP) that targets the posterior mean directly. We show that RMP can be implemented by solving a variational inference problem, which can be further decomposed as minimizing a reverse KL divergence at each reverse step. We further develop an algorithm that optimizes the reverse KL divergence with natural gradient descent using score functions and propagates the mean at each reverse step. Experiments demonstrate the validity of the theory of our framework and show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on reconstruction performance with lower computational complexity in various inverse problems.</description>

      <title>ViBiDSampler: Enhancing Video Interpolation Using Bidirectional Diffusion Sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start &amp; end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws Across Model Architectures: A Comparative Analysis of Dense and MoE Models in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) is a critical research area for the efficiency and effectiveness of model training and deployment. Our work investigates the transferability and discrepancies of scaling laws between Dense Models and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including consistent loss scaling, optimal batch size and learning rate scaling, and resource allocation strategies scaling, our findings reveal that the power-law scaling framework also applies to MoE Models, indicating that the fundamental principles governing the scaling behavior of these models are preserved, even though the architecture differs. Additionally, MoE Models demonstrate superior generalization, resulting in lower testing losses with the same training compute budget compared to Dense Models. These findings indicate the scaling consistency and transfer generalization capabilities of MoE Models, providing new insights for optimizing MoE Model training and deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Inclusion Index with Networks and Similarity: Analysis and its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concepts of ``diversity'' and ``inclusion'' have attracted considerable attention across a range of fields, encompassing both social and biological disciplines. To fully understand these concepts, it is critical to not only examine the number of categories but also the similarities and relationships among them. In this study, I introduce a novel index for diversity and inclusion that considers similarities and network connections. I analyzed the properties of these indices and investigated their mathematical relationships using established measures of diversity and networks. Moreover, I developed a methodology for estimating similarities based on the utility of diversity. I also created a method for visualizing proportions, similarities, and network connections. Finally, I evaluated the correlation with external metrics using real-world data, confirming that both the proposed indices and our index can be effectively utilized. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of diversity and inclusion analysis.</description>

      <title>T2V-Turbo-v2: Enhancing Video Generation Model Post-Training through Data, Reward, and Conditional Guidance Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.</description>

      <title>Copiloting Diagnosis of Autism in Real Clinical Scenarios via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder(ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder that significantly impacts the daily functioning and social participation of individuals. Despite the abundance of research focused on supporting the clinical diagnosis of ASD, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive exploration in the field of methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly regarding the real-world clinical diagnostic scenarios based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2). Therefore, we have proposed a framework called ADOS-Copilot, which strikes a balance between scoring and explanation and explored the factors that influence the performance of LLMs in this task. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework is competitive with the diagnostic results of clinicians, with a minimum MAE of 0.4643, binary classification F1-score of 81.79\%, and ternary classification F1-score of 78.37\%. Furthermore, we have systematically elucidated the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in this task from the perspectives of ADOS-2, LLMs' capabilities, language, and model scale aiming to inspire and guide the future application of LLMs in a broader fields of mental health disorders. We hope for more research to be transferred into real clinical practice, opening a window of kindness to the world for eccentric children.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Approach for Data-Efficient French Pronunciation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have addressed intricate phonological phenomena in French, relying on either extensive linguistic knowledge or a significant amount of sentence-level pronunciation data. However, creating such resources is expensive and non-trivial. To this end, we propose a novel two-step approach that encompasses two pronunciation tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme and post-lexical processing. We then investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach with a notably limited amount of sentence-level pronunciation data. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed two-step approach effectively mitigates the lack of extensive labeled data, and serves as a feasible solution for addressing French phonological phenomena even under resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>PixLens: A Novel Framework for Disentangled Evaluation in Diffusion-Based Image Editing with Object Detection + SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating diffusion-based image-editing models is a crucial task in the field of Generative AI. Specifically, it is imperative to assess their capacity to execute diverse editing tasks while preserving the image content and realism. While recent developments in generative models have opened up previously unheard-of possibilities for image editing, conducting a thorough evaluation of these models remains a challenging and open task. The absence of a standardized evaluation benchmark, primarily due to the inherent need for a post-edit reference image for evaluation, further complicates this issue. Currently, evaluations often rely on established models such as CLIP or require human intervention for a comprehensive understanding of the performance of these image editing models. Our benchmark, PixLens, provides a comprehensive evaluation of both edit quality and latent representation disentanglement, contributing to the advancement and refinement of existing methodologies in the field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Modeling of Video LLMs via Time Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/TG-Vid.</description>

      <title>Mero Nagarikta: Advanced Nepali Citizenship Data Extractor with Deep Learning-Powered Text Detection and OCR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming text-based identity documents, such as Nepali citizenship cards, into a structured digital format poses several challenges due to the distinct characteristics of the Nepali script and minor variations in print alignment and contrast across different cards. This work proposes a robust system using YOLOv8 for accurate text object detection and an OCR algorithm based on Optimized PyTesseract. The system, implemented within the context of a mobile application, allows for the automated extraction of important textual information from both the front and the back side of Nepali citizenship cards, including names, citizenship numbers, and dates of birth. The final YOLOv8 model was accurate, with a mean average precision of 99.1% for text detection on the front and 96.1% on the back. The tested PyTesseract optimized for Nepali characters outperformed the standard OCR regarding flexibility and accuracy, extracting text from images with clean and noisy backgrounds and various contrasts. Using preprocessing steps such as converting the images into grayscale, removing noise from the images, and detecting edges further improved the system's OCR accuracy, even for low-quality photos. This work expands the current body of research in multilingual OCR and document analysis, especially for low-resource languages such as Nepali. It emphasizes the effectiveness of combining the latest object detection framework with OCR models that have been fine-tuned for practical applications.</description>

      <title>KnowledgeSG: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Text Generation with Knowledge Distillation from Server</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) facilitate many parties to fine-tune LLMs on their own private data. However, this practice raises privacy concerns due to the memorization of LLMs. Existing solutions, such as utilizing synthetic data for substitution, struggle to simultaneously improve performance and preserve privacy. They either rely on a local model for generation, resulting in a performance decline, or take advantage of APIs, directly exposing the data to API servers. To address this issue, we propose \textit{KnowledgeSG}, a novel client-server framework which enhances synthetic data quality and improves model performance while ensuring privacy. We achieve this by learning local knowledge from the private data with differential privacy (DP) and distilling professional knowledge from the server. Additionally, inspired by federated learning, we transmit models rather than data between the client and server to prevent privacy leakage. Extensive experiments in medical and financial domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KnowledgeSG. Our code is now publicly available at https://github.com/wwh0411/KnowledgeSG.</description>

      <title>Less is more: Embracing sparsity and interpolation with Esiformer for time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has played a significant role in many practical fields. But time series data generated from real-world applications always exhibits high variance and lots of noise, which makes it difficult to capture the inherent periodic patterns of the data, hurting the prediction accuracy significantly. To address this issue, we propose the Esiformer, which apply interpolation on the original data, decreasing the overall variance of the data and alleviating the influence of noise. What's more, we enhanced the vanilla transformer with a robust Sparse FFN. It can enhance the representation ability of the model effectively, and maintain the excellent robustness, avoiding the risk of overfitting compared with the vanilla implementation. Through evaluations on challenging real-world datasets, our method outperforms leading model PatchTST, reducing MSE by 6.5% and MAE by 5.8% in multivariate time series forecasting. Code is available at: https://github.com/yyg1282142265/Esiformer/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Equi-GSPR: Equivariant SE(3) Graph Network Model for Sparse Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud registration is a foundational task for 3D alignment and reconstruction applications. While both traditional and learning-based registration approaches have succeeded, leveraging the intrinsic symmetry of point cloud data, including rotation equivariance, has received insufficient attention. This prohibits the model from learning effectively, resulting in a requirement for more training data and increased model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network model embedded with a local Spherical Euclidean 3D equivariance property through SE(3) message passing based propagation. Our model is composed mainly of a descriptor module, equivariant graph layers, match similarity, and the final regression layers. Such modular design enables us to utilize sparsely sampled input points and initialize the descriptor by self-trained or pre-trained geometric feature descriptors easily. Experiments conducted on the 3DMatch and KITTI datasets exhibit the compelling and robust performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while the model complexity remains relatively low at the same time.</description>

Abstract: Telepresence technology aims to provide an immersive virtual presence for remote conference applications, and it is extremely important to synthesize high-quality binaural audio signals for this aim. Because the ambient noise is often inevitable in practical application scenarios, it is highly desired that binaural audio signals without noise can be obtained from microphone-array signals directly. For this purpose, this paper proposes a new end-to-end noise-immune binaural audio synthesis framework from microphone-array signals, abbreviated as Array2BR, and experimental results show that binaural cues can be correctly mapped and noise can be well suppressed simultaneously using the proposed framework. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method achieved better performance in terms of both objective and subjective metric scores.</description>

      <title>Learning to Race in Extreme Turning Scene with Active Exploration and Gaussian Process Regression-based MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often induces large side-slip angles, presenting a formidable challenge in vehicle control. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces an Active Exploration with Double GPR (AEDGPR) system. The system initiates by planning a minimum-time trajectory with a Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) compensated model. The planning results show that in the cornering section, the yaw angular velocity and side-slip angle are in opposite directions, indicating that the vehicle is drifting. In response, we develop a drift controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and incorporate Gaussian Process Regression to correct discrepancies in the vehicle dynamics model. Moreover, the covariance from the GPR is employed to actively explore various cornering states, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments using a 1/10 scale RC vehicle.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Deep Neural Networks in the Hard-Label Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are valuable assets, yet their public accessibility raises security concerns about parameter extraction by malicious actors. Recent work by Carlini et al. (crypto'20) and Canales-Mart\'inez et al. (eurocrypt'24) has drawn parallels between this issue and block cipher key extraction via chosen plaintext attacks. Leveraging differential cryptanalysis, they demonstrated that all the weights and biases of black-box ReLU-based DNNs could be inferred using a polynomial number of queries and computational time. However, their attacks relied on the availability of the exact numeric value of output logits, which allowed the calculation of their derivatives. To overcome this limitation, Chen et al. (asiacrypt'24) tackled the more realistic hard-label scenario, where only the final classification label (e.g., "dog" or "car") is accessible to the attacker. They proposed an extraction method requiring a polynomial number of queries but an exponential execution time. In addition, their approach was applicable only to a restricted set of architectures, could deal only with binary classifiers, and was demonstrated only on tiny neural networks with up to four neurons split among up to two hidden layers. This paper introduces new techniques that, for the first time, achieve cryptanalytic extraction of DNN parameters in the most challenging hard-label setting, using both a polynomial number of queries and polynomial time. We validate our approach by extracting nearly one million parameters from a DNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 832 neurons in four hidden layers. Our results reveal the surprising fact that all the weights of a ReLU-based DNN can be efficiently determined by analyzing only the geometric shape of its decision boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Embodied AI represents a paradigm in AI research where artificial agents are situated within and interact with physical or virtual environments. Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Training-free Diffusion Model Alignment with Sampling Demons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation.</description>

      <title>Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Integrated Encoding and Quantization to Enhance Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image processing is one of the most promising applications for quantum machine learning (QML). Quanvolutional Neural Networks with non-trainable parameters are the preferred solution to run on current and near future quantum devices. The typical input preprocessing pipeline for quanvolutional layers comprises of four steps: optional input binary quantization, encoding classical data into quantum states, processing the data to obtain the final quantum states, decoding quantum states back to classical outputs. In this paper we propose two ways to enhance the efficiency of quanvolutional models. First, we propose a flexible data quantization approach with memoization, applicable to any encoding method. This allows us to increase the number of quantization levels to retain more information or lower them to reduce the amount of circuit executions. Second, we introduce a new integrated encoding strategy, which combines the encoding and processing steps in a single circuit. This method allows great flexibility on several architectural parameters (e.g., number of qubits, filter size, and circuit depth) making them adjustable to quantum hardware requirements. We compare our proposed integrated model with a classical convolutional neural network and the well-known rotational encoding method, on two different classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed model encoding exhibits a comparable or superior performance to the other models while requiring fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>LightRAG: Simple and Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAG systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval system that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.</description>

      <title>F\"urElise: Capturing and Physically Synthesizing Hand Motions of Piano Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piano playing requires agile, precise, and coordinated hand control that stretches the limits of dexterity. Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Core Tokensets for Data-efficient Sequential Training of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep networks are frequently tuned to novel tasks and continue learning from ongoing data streams. Such sequential training requires consolidation of new and past information, a challenge predominantly addressed by retaining the most important data points - formally known as coresets. Traditionally, these coresets consist of entire samples, such as images or sentences. However, recent transformer architectures operate on tokens, leading to the famous assertion that an image is worth 16x16 words. Intuitively, not all of these tokens are equally informative or memorable. Going beyond coresets, we thus propose to construct a deeper-level data summary on the level of tokens. Our respectively named core tokensets both select the most informative data points and leverage feature attribution to store only their most relevant features. We demonstrate that core tokensets yield significant performance retention in incremental image classification, open-ended visual question answering, and continual image captioning with significantly reduced memory. In fact, we empirically find that a core tokenset of 1\% of the data performs comparably to at least a twice as large and up to 10 times larger coreset.</description>

      <title>Retrieving, Rethinking and Revising: The Chain-of-Verification Can Improve Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating extensive knowledge retrieved from external sources. However, such approach encounters some challenges: Firstly, the original queries may not be suitable for precise retrieval, resulting in erroneous contextual knowledge; Secondly, the language model can easily generate inconsistent answer with external references due to their knowledge boundary limitation. To address these issues, we propose the chain-of-verification (CoV-RAG) to enhance the external retrieval correctness and internal generation consistency. Specifically, we integrate the verification module into the RAG, engaging in scoring, judgment, and rewriting. To correct external retrieval errors, CoV-RAG retrieves new knowledge using a revised query. To correct internal generation errors, we unify QA and verification tasks with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during training. Our comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability compared with other strong baselines. Especially, our CoV-RAG can significantly surpass the state-of-the-art baselines using different LLM backbones.</description>

      <title>PostCast: Generalizable Postprocessing for Precipitation Nowcasting via Unsupervised Blurriness Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting plays a pivotal role in socioeconomic sectors, especially in severe convective weather warnings. Although notable progress has been achieved by approaches mining the spatiotemporal correlations with deep learning, these methods still suffer severe blurriness as the lead time increases, which hampers accurate predictions for extreme precipitation. To alleviate blurriness, researchers explore generative methods conditioned on blurry predictions. However, the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth need to be generated in advance, making the training pipeline cumbersome and limiting the generality of generative models within blur modes that appear in training data. By rethinking the blurriness in precipitation nowcasting as a blur kernel acting on predictions, we propose an unsupervised postprocessing method to eliminate the blurriness without the requirement of training with the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth. Specifically, we utilize blurry predictions to guide the generation process of a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to obtain high-fidelity predictions with eliminated blurriness. A zero-shot blur kernel estimation mechanism and an auto-scale denoise guidance strategy are introduced to adapt the unconditional DDPM to any blurriness modes varying from datasets and lead times in precipitation nowcasting. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 precipitation radar datasets, demonstrating the generality and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Update Balancing Algorithm for Multi-task Ranking Models in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task ranking models have become essential for modern real-world recommendation systems. While most recommendation researches focus on designing sophisticated models for specific scenarios, achieving performance improvement for multi-task ranking models across various scenarios still remains a significant challenge. Training all tasks naively can result in inconsistent learning, highlighting the need for the development of multi-task optimization (MTO) methods to tackle this challenge. Conventional methods assume that the optimal joint gradient on shared parameters leads to optimal parameter updates. However, the actual update on model parameters may deviates significantly from gradients when using momentum based optimizers such as Adam, and we design and execute statistical experiments to support the observation. In this paper, we propose a novel Parameter Update Balancing algorithm for multi-task optimization, denoted as PUB. In contrast to traditional MTO method which are based on gradient level tasks fusion or loss level tasks fusion, PUB is the first work to optimize multiple tasks through parameter update balancing. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark multi-task ranking datasets demonstrate that PUB consistently improves several multi-task backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, experiments on benchmark computer vision datasets show the great potential of PUB in various multi-task learning scenarios. Furthermore, we deployed our method for an industrial evaluation on the real-world commercial platform, HUAWEI AppGallery, where PUB significantly enhances the online multi-task ranking model, efficiently managing the primary traffic of a crucial channel.</description>

      <title>Towards an Operational Responsible AI Framework for Learning Analytics in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universities are increasingly adopting data-driven strategies to enhance student success, with AI applications like Learning Analytics (LA) and Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) playing a key role in identifying at-risk students, personalising learning, supporting teachers, and guiding educational decision-making. However, concerns are rising about potential harms these systems may pose, such as algorithmic biases leading to unequal support for minority students. While many have explored the need for Responsible AI in LA, existing works often lack practical guidance for how institutions can operationalise these principles. In this paper, we propose a novel Responsible AI framework tailored specifically to LA in Higher Education (HE). We started by mapping 11 established Responsible AI frameworks, including those by leading tech companies, to the context of LA in HE. This led to the identification of seven key principles such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. We then conducted a systematic review of the literature to understand how these principles have been applied in practice. Drawing from these findings, we present a novel framework that offers practical guidance to HE institutions and is designed to evolve with community input, ensuring its relevance as LA systems continue to develop.</description>

      <title>Time Transfer: On Optimal Learning Rate and Batch Size In The Infinite Data Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in optimal scaling of large language models (LLMs) is the prohibitive cost of hyperparameter tuning, particularly learning rate $\eta$ and batch size $B$. While techniques like $\mu$P (Yang et al., 2022) provide scaling rules for optimal $\eta$ transfer in the infinite model size limit, the optimal scaling behavior in the infinite data size limit ($T \to \infty$) remains unknown. We fill in this gap by observing for the first time an interplay of three optimal $\eta$ scaling regimes: $\eta \propto \sqrt{T}$, $\eta \propto 1$, and $\eta \propto 1/\sqrt{T}$ with transitions controlled by $B$ and its relation to the time-evolving critical batch size $B_\mathrm{crit} \propto T$. Furthermore, we show that the optimal batch size is positively correlated with $B_\mathrm{crit}$: keeping it fixed becomes suboptimal over time even if learning rate is scaled optimally. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that the observed optimal $\eta$ and $B$ dynamics are preserved with $\mu$P model scaling, challenging the conventional view of $B_\mathrm{crit}$ dependence solely on loss value. Complementing optimality, we examine the sensitivity of loss to changes in learning rate, where we find the sensitivity to decrease with $T \to \infty$ and to remain constant with $\mu$P model scaling. We hope our results make the first step towards a unified picture of the joint optimal data and model scaling.</description>

      <title>Communicating with Speakers and Listeners of Different Pragmatic Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of variable pragmatic competence on communicative success through simulating language learning and conversing between speakers and listeners with different levels of reasoning abilities. Through studying this interaction, we hypothesize that matching levels of reasoning between communication partners would create a more beneficial environment for communicative success and language learning. Our research findings indicate that learning from more explicit, literal language is advantageous, irrespective of the learner's level of pragmatic competence. Furthermore, we find that integrating pragmatic reasoning during language learning, not just during evaluation, significantly enhances overall communication performance. This paper provides key insights into the importance of aligning reasoning levels and incorporating pragmatic reasoning in optimizing communicative interactions.</description>

      <title>MelissaDL x Breed: Towards Data-Efficient On-line Supervised Training of Multi-parametric Surrogates with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming scientific computing with deep neural network surrogates that approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional off-line training methods face issues with storage and I/O efficiency, as the training dataset has to be computed with numerical solvers up-front. Our previous work, the Melissa framework, addresses these problems by enabling data to be created "on-the-fly" and streamed directly into the training process. In this paper we introduce a new active learning method to enhance data-efficiency for on-line surrogate training. The surrogate is direct and multi-parametric, i.e., it is trained to predict a given timestep directly with different initial and boundary conditions parameters. Our approach uses Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling guided by training loss statistics, in order to focus NN training on the difficult areas of the parameter space. Preliminary results for 2D heat PDE demonstrate the potential of this method, called Breed, to improve the generalization capabilities of surrogates while reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language is composed of words, but modern LLMs process sub-words as input. A natural question raised by this discrepancy is whether LLMs encode words internally, and if so how. We present evidence that LLMs engage in an intrinsic detokenization process, where sub-word sequences are combined into coherent word representations. Our experiments show that this process takes place primarily within the early and middle layers of the model. They also show that it is robust to non-morphemic splits, typos and perhaps importantly-to out-of-vocabulary words: when feeding the inner representation of such words to the model as input vectors, it can "understand" them despite never seeing them during training. Our findings suggest that LLMs maintain a latent vocabulary beyond the tokenizer's scope. These insights provide a practical, finetuning-free application for expanding the vocabulary of pre-trained models. By enabling the addition of new vocabulary words, we reduce input length and inference iterations, which reduces both space and model latency, with little to no loss in model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unobserved Object Detection using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we detect an object that is not visible in an image? This study introduces the novel task of 2D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to solve this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision--language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that captures different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluations on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k dataset with COCO object categories demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task. The current work presents a promising step towards compelling applications like visual search and probabilistic planning that can leverage object detection beyond what can be directly observed.</description>

      <title>A second-order-like optimizer with adaptive gradient scaling for deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this empirical article, we introduce INNAprop, an optimization algorithm that combines the INNA method with the RMSprop adaptive gradient scaling. It leverages second-order information and rescaling while keeping the memory requirements of standard DL methods as AdamW or SGD with momentum.After having recalled our geometrical motivations, we provide quite extensive experiments. On image classification (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and language modeling (GPT-2), INNAprop consistently matches or outperforms AdamW both in training speed and accuracy, with minimal hyperparameter tuning in large-scale settings. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/innaprop/innaprop}.</description>

      <title>MEXA: Multilingual Evaluation of English-Centric LLMs via Cross-Lingual Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: English-centric large language models (LLMs) often show strong multilingual capabilities. However, the multilingual performance of these models remains unclear and is not thoroughly evaluated for many languages. Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks, or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages the fact that English-centric LLMs use English as a kind of pivot language in their intermediate layers. It computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in other languages. We conduct studies using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family, Mistral, and OLMo), and established downstream tasks (Belebele, m-MMLU, and m-ARC). We explore different methods to compute embeddings in decoder-only models. Our results show that MEXA, in its default settings, achieves a statistically significant average Pearson correlation of 0.90 with three established downstream tasks across nine models and two parallel datasets. This suggests that MEXA is a reliable method for estimating the multilingual capabilities of English-centric LLMs, providing a clearer understanding of their multilingual potential and the inner workings of LLMs. Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/cis-lmu/Mexa, Code: https://github.com/cisnlp/Mexa.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based fault identification in condition monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibration-based condition monitoring techniques are commonly used to identify faults in rolling element bearings. Accuracy and speed of fault detection procedures are critical performance measures in condition monitoring. Delay is especially important in remote condition monitoring and time-sensitive industrial applications. While most existing methods focus on accuracy, little attention has been given to the inference time in the fault identification process. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for real-time fault identification in rolling element bearings. We encode raw vibration signals into two-dimensional images using various encoding methods and use these with a CNN to classify several categories of bearing fault types and sizes. We analyse the interplay between fault identification accuracy and processing time. For training and evaluation we use a bearing failure CWRU dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles, equipped with water quality sensors and artificial vision systems, allows for a smart and adaptive deployment in water resources environmental monitoring. This paper presents a real implementation of a vehicle prototype that to address the use of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and enhanced sensing techniques for water quality monitoring. The vehicle is fully equipped with high-quality sensors to measure water quality parameters and water depth. Furthermore, by means of a stereo-camera, it also can detect and locate macro-plastics in real environments by means of deep visual models, such as YOLOv5. In this paper, experimental results, carried out in Lago Mayor (Sevilla), has been presented as proof of the capabilities of the proposed architecture. The overall system, and the early results obtained, are expected to provide a solid example of a real platform useful for the water resource monitoring task, and to serve as a real case scenario for deploying Artificial Intelligence algorithms, such as path planning, artificial vision, etc.</description>

      <title>Mini-Batch Kernel $k$-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first mini-batch kernel $k$-means algorithm, offering an order of magnitude improvement in running time compared to the full batch algorithm. A single iteration of our algorithm takes $\widetilde{O}(kb^2)$ time, significantly faster than the $O(n^2)$ time required by the full batch kernel $k$-means, where $n$ is the dataset size and $b$ is the batch size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves a 10-100x speedup with minimal loss in quality, addressing the slow runtime that has limited kernel $k$-means adoption in practice. We further complement these results with a theoretical analysis under an early stopping condition, proving that with a batch size of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\max \{\gamma^{4}, \gamma^{2}\} \cdot \epsilon^{-2})$, the algorithm terminates in $O(\gamma^2/\epsilon)$ iterations with high probability, where $\gamma$ bounds the norm of points in feature space and $\epsilon$ is a termination threshold. Our analysis holds for any reasonable center initialization, and when using $k$-means++ initialization, the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\log k)$ in expectation. For normalized kernels, such as Gaussian or Laplacian it holds that $\gamma=1$. Taking $\epsilon = O(1)$ and $b=\Theta(\log n)$, the algorithm terminates in $O(1)$ iterations, with each iteration running in $\widetilde{O}(k)$ time.</description>

      <title>Automatic Summarization of Long Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vast amount of textual data is added to the internet daily, making utilization and interpretation of such data difficult and cumbersome. As a result, automatic text summarization is crucial for extracting relevant information, saving precious reading time. Although many transformer-based models excel in summarization, they are constrained by their input size, preventing them from processing texts longer than their context size. This study introduces three novel algorithms that allow any LLM to efficiently overcome its input size limitation, effectively utilizing its full potential without any architectural modifications. We test our algorithms on texts with more than 70,000 words, and our experiments show a significant increase in BERTScore with competitive ROUGE scores.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error correction codes (ECC) are crucial for ensuring reliable information transmission in communication systems. Choukroun &amp; Wolf (2022b) recently introduced the Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT), which has demonstrated promising performance across various transmission channels and families of codes. However, its high computational and memory demands limit its practical applications compared to traditional decoding algorithms. Achieving effective quantization of the ECCT presents significant challenges due to its inherently small architecture, since existing, very low-precision quantization techniques often lead to performance degradation in compact neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel acceleration method for transformer-based decoders. We first propose a ternary weight quantization method specifically designed for the ECCT, inducing a decoder with multiplication-free linear layers. We present an optimized self-attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity via codeaware multi-heads processing. Finally, we provide positional encoding via the Tanner graph eigendecomposition, enabling a richer representation of the graph connectivity. The approach not only matches or surpasses ECCT's performance but also significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and computational complexity. Our method brings transformer-based error correction closer to practical implementation in resource-constrained environments, achieving a 90% compression ratio and reducing arithmetic operation energy consumption by at least 224 times on modern hardware.</description>

Abstract: While many state-of-the-art LLMs have shown poor logical and basic mathematical reasoning, recent works try to improve their problem-solving abilities using prompting techniques. We propose giving "hints" to improve the language model's performance on advanced mathematical problems, taking inspiration from how humans approach math pedagogically. We also test the model's adversarial robustness to wrong hints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating various LLMs, presenting them with a diverse set of problems of different difficulties and topics from the MATH dataset and comparing against techniques such as one-shot, few-shot, and chain of thought prompting.</description>

      <title>FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts. We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for the speech enhancement task. We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space. This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model. The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline. Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>Beyond Captioning: Task-Specific Prompting for Improved VLM Performance in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed tasks requiring visual and reasoning abilities, such as image retrieval and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite their success, VLMs face significant challenges with tasks involving geometric reasoning, algebraic problem-solving, and counting. These limitations stem from difficulties effectively integrating multiple modalities and accurately interpreting geometry-related tasks. Various works claim that introducing a captioning pipeline before VQA tasks enhances performance. We incorporated this pipeline for tasks involving geometry, algebra, and counting. We found that captioning results are not generalizable, specifically with larger VLMs primarily trained on downstream QnA tasks showing random performance on math-related challenges. However, we present a promising alternative: task-based prompting, enriching the prompt with task-specific guidance. This approach shows promise and proves more effective than direct captioning methods for math-heavy problems.</description>

      <title>Fortify Your Foundations: Practical Privacy and Security for Foundation Model Deployments In The Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) display exceptional performance in tasks such as natural language processing and are being applied across a growing range of disciplines. Although typically trained on large public datasets, FMs are often fine-tuned or integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which rely on private data. This access, along with their size and costly training, heightens the risk of intellectual property theft. Moreover, multimodal FMs may expose sensitive information. In this work, we examine the FM threat model and discuss the practicality and comprehensiveness of various approaches for securing against them, such as ML-based methods and trusted execution environments (TEEs). We demonstrate that TEEs offer an effective balance between strong security properties, usability, and performance. Specifically, we present a solution achieving less than 10\% overhead versus bare metal for the full Llama2 7B and 13B inference pipelines running inside \intel\ SGX and \intel\ TDX. We also share our configuration files and insights from our implementation. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show the practicality of TEEs for securing FMs.</description>

      <title>EMMA: Empowering Multi-modal Mamba with Structural and Hierarchical Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mamba-based architectures have shown to be a promising new direction for deep learning models owing to their competitive performance and sub-quadratic deployment speed. However, current Mamba multi-modal large language models (MLLM) are insufficient in extracting visual features, leading to imbalanced cross-modal alignment between visual and textural latents, negatively impacting performance on multi-modal tasks. In this work, we propose Empowering Multi-modal Mamba with Structural and Hierarchical Alignment (EMMA), which enables the MLLM to extract fine-grained visual information. Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise alignment module to autoregressively optimize the learning and processing of spatial image-level features along with textual tokens, enabling structural alignment at the image level. In addition, to prevent the degradation of visual information during the cross-model alignment process, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module to combine multi-scale visual features from intermediate layers, enabling hierarchical alignment at the feature level. Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks. Our model shows lower latency than other Mamba-based MLLMs and is nearly four times faster than transformer-based MLLMs of similar scale during inference. Due to better cross-modal alignment, our model exhibits lower degrees of hallucination and enhanced sensitivity to visual details, which manifests in superior performance across diverse multi-modal benchmarks. Code will be provided.</description>

      <title>STNet: Deep Audio-Visual Fusion Network for Robust Speaker Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking aims to determine the location of human targets in a scene using signals captured by a multi-sensor platform, whose accuracy and robustness can be improved by multi-modal fusion methods. Recently, several fusion methods have been proposed to model the correlation in multiple modalities. However, for the speaker tracking problem, the cross-modal interaction between audio and visual signals hasn't been well exploited. To this end, we present a novel Speaker Tracking Network (STNet) with a deep audio-visual fusion model in this work. We design a visual-guided acoustic measurement method to fuse heterogeneous cues in a unified localization space, which employs visual observations via a camera model to construct the enhanced acoustic map. For feature fusion, a cross-modal attention module is adopted to jointly model multi-modal contexts and interactions. The correlated information between audio and visual features is further interacted in the fusion model. Moreover, the STNet-based tracker is applied to multi-speaker cases by a quality-aware module, which evaluates the reliability of multi-modal observations to achieve robust tracking in complex scenarios. Experiments on the AV16.3 and CAV3D datasets show that the proposed STNet-based tracker outperforms uni-modal methods and state-of-the-art audio-visual speaker trackers.</description>

      <title>FLOPS: Forward Learning with OPtimal Sampling</title>

Abstract: Given the limitations of backpropagation, perturbation-based gradient computation methods have recently gained focus for learning with only forward passes, also referred to as queries. Conventional forward learning consumes enormous queries on each data point for accurate gradient estimation through Monte Carlo sampling, which hinders the scalability of those algorithms. However, not all data points deserve equal queries for gradient estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the forward learning efficiency from a novel perspective: how to reduce the gradient estimation variance with minimum cost? For this, we propose to allocate the optimal number of queries over each data in one batch during training to achieve a good balance between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, with a simplified proxy objective and a reparameterization technique, we derive a novel plug-and-play query allocator with minimal parameters. Theoretical results are carried out to verify its optimality. We conduct extensive experiments for fine-tuning Vision Transformers on various datasets and further deploy the allocator to two black-box applications: prompt tuning and multimodal alignment for foundation models. All findings demonstrate that our proposed allocator significantly enhances the scalability of forward-learning algorithms, paving the way for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>PDF-WuKong: A Large Multimodal Model for Efficient Long PDF Reading with End-to-End Sparse Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document understanding is a challenging task to process and comprehend large amounts of textual and visual information. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of this task. However, existing methods typically focus on either plain text or a limited number of document images, struggling to handle long PDF documents with interleaved text and images, especially in academic papers. In this paper, we introduce PDF-WuKong, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) which is designed to enhance multimodal question-answering (QA) for long PDF documents. PDF-WuKong incorporates a sparse sampler that operates on both text and image representations, significantly improving the efficiency and capability of the MLLM. The sparse sampler is integrated with the MLLM's image encoder and selects the paragraphs or diagrams most pertinent to user queries for processing by the language model. To effectively train and evaluate our model, we construct PaperPDF, a dataset consisting of a broad collection of academic papers sourced from arXiv, multiple strategies are proposed to generate automatically 1M QA pairs along with their corresponding evidence sources. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of our approach over other models on the task of long multimodal PDF understanding, surpassing proprietary products by an average of 8.6% on F1. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/PDF-Wukong.</description>

      <title>Long-Context LLMs Meet RAG: Overcoming Challenges for Long Inputs in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources. The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs. It is plausible to assume that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant information (higher recall), that might result in improved performance. However, our empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently declines as the number of retrieved passages increases. This paper investigates this phenomenon, identifying the detrimental impact of retrieved "hard negatives" as a key contributor. To mitigate this and enhance the robustness of long-context LLM-based RAG, we propose both training-free and training-based approaches. We first showcase the effectiveness of retrieval reordering as a simple yet powerful training-free optimization. Furthermore, we explore training-based methods, specifically RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning, demonstrating their capacity for substantial performance gains. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis of design choices for these training-based methods, including data distribution, retriever selection, and training context length.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decoupled Backpropagation and Layer-Wise Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has created the need for more efficient alternatives to the standard error backpropagation algorithm, that make better use of asynchronous, parallel and distributed computing. One major shortcoming of backpropagation is the interlocking between the forward phase of the algorithm, which computes a global loss, and the backward phase where the loss is backpropagated through all layers to compute the gradients, which are used to update the network parameters. To address this problem, we propose a method that parallelises SGD updates across the layers of a model by asynchronously updating them from multiple threads. Furthermore, since we observe that the forward pass is often much faster than the backward pass, we use separate threads for the forward and backward pass calculations, which allows us to use a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, reducing the overall staleness of the parameters. Thus, our approach performs asynchronous stochastic gradient descent using separate threads for the loss (forward) and gradient (backward) computations and performs layer-wise partial updates to parameters in a distributed way. We show that this approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to 2.97x faster than Hogwild! scaled on multiple devices (Locally-Partitioned-Asynchronous-Parallel SGD). We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithm using a novel theoretical framework based on stochastic differential equations and the drift diffusion process, by modeling the asynchronous parameter updates as a stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Lyapunov Exponents in designing deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large deep neural networks is resource intensive. This study investigates whether Lyapunov exponents can accelerate this process by aiding in the selection of hyperparameters. To study this I formulate an optimization problem using neural networks with different activation functions in the hidden layers. By initializing model weights with different random seeds, I calculate the Lyapunov exponent while performing traditional gradient descent on these model weights. The findings demonstrate that variations in the learning rate can induce chaotic changes in model weights. I also show that activation functions with more negative Lyapunov exponents exhibit better convergence properties. Additionally, the study also demonstrates that Lyapunov exponents can be utilized to select effective initial model weights for deep neural networks, potentially enhancing the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Vector Grimoire: Codebook-based Shape Generation under Raster Image Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a popular format on the web and in the design industry. However, despite the great strides made in generative modeling, SVG has remained underexplored due to the discrete and complex nature of such data. We introduce GRIMOIRE, a text-guided SVG generative model that is comprised of two modules: A Visual Shape Quantizer (VSQ) learns to map raster images onto a discrete codebook by reconstructing them as vector shapes, and an Auto-Regressive Transformer (ART) models the joint probability distribution over shape tokens, positions and textual descriptions, allowing us to generate vector graphics from natural language. Unlike existing models that require direct supervision from SVG data, GRIMOIRE learns shape image patches using only raster image supervision which opens up vector generative modeling to significantly more data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting GRIMOIRE for closed filled shapes on the MNIST and for outline strokes on icon and font data, surpassing previous image-supervised methods in generative quality and vector-supervised approach in flexibility.</description>

      <title>A large collection of bioinformatics question-query pairs over federated knowledge graphs: methodology and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. In the last decades, several life science resources have structured data using the same framework and made these accessible using the same query language to facilitate interoperability. Knowledge graphs have seen increased adoption in bioinformatics due to their advantages for representing data in a generic graph format. For example, yummydata.org catalogs more than 60 knowledge graphs accessible through SPARQL, a technical query language. Although SPARQL allows powerful, expressive queries, even across physically distributed knowledge graphs, formulating such queries is a challenge for most users. Therefore, to guide users in retrieving the relevant data, many of these resources provide representative examples. These examples can also be an important source of information for machine learning, if a sufficiently large number of examples are provided and published in a common, machine-readable and standardized format across different resources.
  Findings. We introduce a large collection of human-written natural language questions and their corresponding SPARQL queries over federated bioinformatics knowledge graphs (KGs) collected for several years across different research groups at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The collection comprises more than 1000 example questions and queries, including 65 federated queries. We propose a methodology to uniformly represent the examples with minimal metadata, based on existing standards. Furthermore, we introduce an extensive set of open-source applications, including query graph visualizations and smart query editors, easily reusable by KG maintainers who adopt the proposed methodology.
  Conclusions. We encourage the community to adopt and extend the proposed methodology, towards richer KG metadata and improved Semantic Web services.</description>

      <title>SplaTraj: Camera Trajectory Generation with Semantic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general method for the exploration of equivalence classes in the input space of Transformer models. The proposed approach is based on sound mathematical theory which describes the internal layers of a Transformer architecture as sequential deformations of the input manifold. Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. We illustrate how this method can be used as a powerful tool for investigating how a Transformer sees the input space, facilitating local and task-agnostic explainability in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for expanding residual computational graphs using jets, operators that generalize truncated Taylor series. Our method provides a systematic approach to disentangle contributions of different computational paths to model predictions. In contrast to existing techniques such as distillation, probing, or early decoding, our expansions rely solely on the model itself and requires no data, training, or sampling from the model. We demonstrate how our framework grounds and subsumes logit lens, reveals a (super-)exponential path structure in the recursive residual depth and opens up several applications. These include sketching a transformer large language model with $n$-gram statistics extracted from its computations, and indexing the models' levels of toxicity knowledge. Our approach enables data-free analysis of residual computation for model interpretability, development, and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Issues in Vulnerability Detection Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging task to identify potential weaknesses in software for cyber security. Recently, deep learning (DL) has made great progress in automating the detection process. Due to the complex multi-layer structure and a large number of parameters, a DL model requires massive labeled (vulnerable or secure) source code to gain knowledge to effectively distinguish between vulnerable and secure code. In the literature, many datasets have been created to train DL models for this purpose. However, these datasets suffer from several issues that will lead to low detection accuracy of DL models. In this paper, we define three critical issues (i.e., data imbalance, low vulnerability coverage, biased vulnerability distribution) that can significantly affect the model performance and three secondary issues (i.e., errors in source code, mislabeling, noisy historical data) that also affect the performance but can be addressed through a dedicated pre-processing procedure. In addition, we conduct a study of 14 papers along with 54 datasets for vulnerability detection to confirm these defined issues. Furthermore, we discuss good practices to use existing datasets and to create new ones.</description>

      <title>Block Induced Signature Generative Adversarial Network (BISGAN): Signature Spoofing Using GANs and Their Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is actively being used in biometrics to develop efficient identification and verification systems. Handwritten signatures are a common subset of biometric data for authentication purposes. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn from original and forged signatures to generate forged signatures. While most GAN techniques create a strong signature verifier, which is the discriminator, there is a need to focus more on the quality of forgeries generated by the generator model. This work focuses on creating a generator that produces forged samples that achieve a benchmark in spoofing signature verification systems. We use CycleGANs infused with Inception model-like blocks with attention heads as the generator and a variation of the SigCNN model as the base Discriminator. We train our model with a new technique that results in 80% to 100% success in signature spoofing. Additionally, we create a custom evaluation technique to act as a goodness measure of the generated forgeries. Our work advocates generator-focused GAN architectures for spoofing data quality that aid in a better understanding of biometric data generation and evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fueled by the popularity of the transformer architecture in deep learning, several works have investigated what formal languages a transformer can learn. Nonetheless, existing results remain hard to compare and a fine-grained understanding of the trainability of transformers on regular languages is still lacking. We investigate transformers trained on regular languages from a mechanistic interpretability perspective. Using an extension of the $L^*$ algorithm, we extract Moore machines from transformers. We empirically find tighter lower bounds on the trainability of transformers, when a finite number of symbols determine the state. Additionally, our mechanistic insight allows us to characterise the regular languages a one-layer transformer can learn with good length generalisation. However, we also identify failure cases where the determining symbols get misrecognised due to saturation of the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>Posets and Bounded Probabilities for Discovering Order-inducing Features in Event Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event knowledge graphs (EKG) extend the classical notion of a trace to capture multiple, interacting views of a process execution. In this paper, we tackle the open problem of automating EKG discovery from uncurated data through a principled, probabilistic framing based on the outcome space resulting from featured-derived partial orders on events. From this, we derive an EKG discovery algorithm based upon statistical inference rather than an ad-hoc or heuristic-based strategy, or relying on manual analysis from domain experts.
  This approach comes at the computational cost of exploring a large, non-convex hypothesis space. In particular, solving the maximum likelihood term involves counting the number of linear extensions of posets, which in general is #P-complete. Fortunately, bound estimates suffice for model comparison, and admit incorporation into a bespoke branch-and-bound algorithm. We show that the posterior probability as defined is antitonic w.r.t. search depth for branching rules that are monotonic w.r.t. model inclusion. This allows pruning of large portions of the search space, which we show experimentally leads to rapid convergence toward optimal solutions that are consistent with manually built EKGs.</description>

      <title>TOWER: Tree Organized Weighting for Evaluating Complex Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex human-written instructions is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. While benchmarks like Chatbot Arena use human judges to assess model performance, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Alternative methods using LLMs as judges, such as AlpacaEval, MT Bench, WildBench, and InFoBench offer improvements but still do not capture that certain complex instruction aspects are more important than others to follow.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation metric, \textsc{TOWER}, that incorporates human-judged importance into the assessment of complex instruction following. We show that human annotators agree with tree-based representations of these complex instructions nearly as much as they agree with other human annotators. We release tree-based annotations of the InFoBench dataset and the corresponding evaluation code to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Native Software Engineering (SE 3.0): A Vision and a Challenge Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI-assisted software engineering (SE 2.0), powered by Foundation Models (FMs) and FM-powered copilots, has shown promise in improving developer productivity. However, it has also exposed inherent limitations, such as cognitive overload on developers and inefficiencies. We propose a shift towards Software Engineering 3.0 (SE 3.0), an AI-native approach characterized by intent-first, conversation-oriented development between human developers and AI teammates. SE 3.0 envisions AI systems evolving beyond task-driven copilots into intelligent collaborators, capable of deeply understanding and reasoning about software engineering principles and intents. We outline the key components of the SE 3.0 technology stack, which includes Teammate.next for adaptive and personalized AI partnership, IDE.next for intent-first conversation-oriented development, Compiler.next for multi-objective code synthesis, and Runtime.next for SLA-aware execution with edge-computing support. Our vision addresses the inefficiencies and cognitive strain of SE 2.0 by fostering a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, maximizing their complementary strengths. We also present a roadmap of challenges that must be overcome to realize our vision of SE 3.0. This paper lays the foundation for future discussions on the role of AI in the next era of software engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has shown great potential in various applications, such as robot control. However, traditional IL methods are usually designed to learn only one specific type of behavior since demonstrations typically correspond to a single expert. In this work, we introduce the first generic framework for Quality Diversity Imitation Learning (QD-IL), which enables the agent to learn a broad range of skills from limited demonstrations. Our framework integrates the principles of quality diversity with adversarial imitation learning (AIL) methods, and can potentially improve any inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method. Empirically, our framework significantly improves the QD performance of GAIL and VAIL on the challenging continuous control tasks derived from Mujoco environments. Moreover, our method even achieves 2x expert performance in the most challenging Humanoid environment.</description>

      <title>Manual Verbalizer Enrichment for Few-Shot Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous development of pre-trained language models, prompt-based training becomes a well-adopted paradigm that drastically improves the exploitation of models for many natural language processing tasks. Prompting also shows great performance compared to traditional fine-tuning when adapted to zero-shot or few-shot scenarios where the number of annotated data is limited. In this framework, the role of verbalizers is essential, as an interpretation from masked word distributions into output predictions. In this work, we propose \acrshort{mave}, an approach for verbalizer construction by enrichment of class labels using neighborhood relation in the embedding space of words for the text classification task. In addition, we elaborate a benchmarking procedure to evaluate typical baselines of verbalizers for document classification in few-shot learning contexts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results while using significantly fewer resources. We show that our approach is particularly effective in cases with extremely limited supervision data.</description>

      <title>SC-Bench: A Large-Scale Dataset for Smart Contract Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a huge demand to ensure the compliance of smart contracts listed on blockchain platforms to safety and economic standards. Today, manual efforts in the form of auditing are commonly used to achieve this goal. ML-based automated techniques have the promise to alleviate human efforts and the resulting monetary costs. However, unlike other domains where ML techniques have had huge successes, no systematic ML techniques have been proposed or applied to smart contract auditing. We present SC-Bench, the first dataset for automated smart-contract auditing research. SC-Bench consists of 5,377 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum, a widely used blockchain platform, and 15,975 violations of standards on Ehereum called ERCs. Out of these violations, 139 are real violations programmers made. The remaining are errors we systematically injected to reflect the violations of different ERC rules. We evaluate SC-Bench using GPT-4 by prompting it with both the contracts and ERC rules. In addition, we manually identify each violated rule and the corresponding code site (i.e., oracle) and prompt GPT-4 with the information asking for a True-or-False question. Our results show that without the oracle, GPT-4 can only detect 0.9% violations, and with the oracle, it detects 22.9% violations. These results show the potential room for improvement in ML-based techniques for smart-contract auditing.</description>

      <title>CBIDR: A novel method for information retrieval combining image and data by means of TOPSIS applied to medical diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have shown promising results in the field of medical diagnosis, which aims to provide support to medical professionals (doctor or pathologist). However, the ultimate decision regarding the diagnosis is made by the medical professional, drawing upon their accumulated experience. In this context, we believe that artificial intelligence can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges in medical diagnosis not by making the final decision but by assisting in the diagnosis process with the most relevant information. The CBIR methods use similarity metrics to compare feature vectors generated from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition to the information contained in medical images, clinical data about the patient is often available and is also relevant in the final decision-making process by medical professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CBIDR, which leverage both medical images and clinical data of patient, combining them through the ranking algorithm TOPSIS. The goal is to aid medical professionals in their final diagnosis by retrieving images and clinical data of patient that are most similar to query data from the database. As a case study, we illustrate our CBIDR for diagnostic of oral cancer including histopathological images and clinical data of patient. Experimental results in terms of accuracy achieved 97.44% in Top-1 and 100% in Top-5 showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting for Regression with Trained Two-Layer ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the least-square regression problem with a two-layer fully-connected neural network, with ReLU activation function, trained by gradient flow. Our first result is a generalization result, that requires no assumptions on the underlying regression function or the noise other than that they are bounded. We operate in the neural tangent kernel regime, and our generalization result is developed via a decomposition of the excess risk into estimation and approximation errors, viewing gradient flow as an implicit regularizer. This decomposition in the context of neural networks is a novel perspective of gradient descent, and helps us avoid uniform convergence traps. In this work, we also establish that under the same setting, the trained network overfits to the data. Together, these results, establishes the first result on benign overfitting for finite-width ReLU networks for arbitrary regression functions.</description>

      <title>Entering Real Social World! Benchmarking the Theory of Mind and Socialization Capabilities of LLMs from a First-person Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the social world, humans possess the capability to infer and reason about others mental states (such as emotions, beliefs, and intentions), known as the Theory of Mind (ToM). Simultaneously, humans own mental states evolve in response to social situations, a capability we refer to as socialization. Together, these capabilities form the foundation of human social interaction. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), especially with the development of large language models (LLMs), we raise an intriguing question: How do LLMs perform in terms of ToM and socialization capabilities? And more broadly, can these AI models truly enter and navigate the real social world? Existing research evaluating LLMs ToM and socialization capabilities by positioning LLMs as passive observers from a third person perspective, rather than as active participants. However, compared to the third-person perspective, observing and understanding the world from an egocentric first person perspective is a natural approach for both humans and AI agents. The ToM and socialization capabilities of LLMs from a first person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing embodied AI agents, remain unexplored. To answer the aforementioned questions and bridge the research gap, we introduce EgoSocialArena, a novel framework designed to evaluate and investigate the ToM and socialization capabilities of LLMs from a first person perspective. It encompasses two evaluation environments: static environment and interactive environment, with seven scenarios: Daily Life, Counterfactual, New World, Blackjack, Number Guessing, and Limit Texas Hold em, totaling 2,195 data entries. With EgoSocialArena, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of nine advanced LLMs and observed some key insights regarding the future development of LLMs as well as the capabilities levels of the most advanced LLMs currently available.</description>

      <title>Integrating Planning into Single-Turn Long-Form Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality, in-depth textual documents, such as academic papers, news articles, Wikipedia entries, and books, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose to use planning to generate long form content. To achieve our goal, we generate intermediate steps via an auxiliary task that teaches the LLM to plan, reason and structure before generating the final text. Our main novelty lies in a single auxiliary task that does not require multiple rounds of prompting or planning. To overcome the scarcity of training data for these intermediate steps, we leverage LLMs to generate synthetic intermediate writing data such as outlines, key information and summaries from existing full articles. Our experiments demonstrate on two datasets from different domains, namely the scientific news dataset SciNews and Wikipedia datasets in KILT-Wiki and FreshWiki, that LLMs fine-tuned with the auxiliary task generate higher quality documents. We observed +2.5% improvement in ROUGE-Lsum, and a strong 3.60 overall win/loss ratio via human SxS evaluation, with clear wins in organization, relevance, and verifiability.</description>

      <title>LeanAgent: Lifelong Learning for Formal Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully proves 162 theorems previously unproved by humans across 23 diverse Lean repositories, many from advanced mathematics. It performs up to 11$\times$ better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem proving performance.</description>

      <title>DataEnvGym: Data Generation Agents in Teacher Environments with Student Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Recent approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid and scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, with their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) being reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 3 diverse tasks (math, code, and VQA) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Timeline and Analysis for Representation Plasticity in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to steer AI behavior is crucial to preventing its long term dangerous and catastrophic potential. Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a novel, powerful method to steer internal model behaviors, such as "honesty", at a top-down level. Understanding the steering of representations should thus be placed at the forefront of alignment initiatives. Unfortunately, current efforts to understand plasticity at this level are highly neglected. This paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap and understand how LLM representation stability, specifically for the concept of "honesty", and model plasticity evolve by applying steering vectors extracted at different fine-tuning stages, revealing differing magnitudes of shifts in model behavior. The findings are pivotal, showing that while early steering exhibits high plasticity, later stages have a surprisingly responsive critical window. This pattern is observed across different model architectures, signaling that there is a general pattern of model plasticity that can be used for effective intervention. These insights greatly contribute to the field of AI transparency, addressing a pressing lack of efficiency limiting our ability to effectively steer model behavior.</description>

      <title>Don't Cut Corners: Exact Conditions for Modularity in Biologically Inspired Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired representations -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise with respect to source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather, we show that sources modularise if their support is "sufficiently spread". From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data. First, we explain why two studies that recorded prefrontal activity in working memory tasks conflict on whether memories are encoded in orthogonal subspaces: the support of the sources differed due to a critical discrepancy in experimental protocol. Second, we use similar arguments to understand why preparatory and potent subspaces in RNN models of motor cortex are only sometimes orthogonal. Third, we study spatial and reward information mixing in entorhinal recordings, and show our theory matches data better than previous work. And fourth, we suggest a suite of surprising settings in which neurons can be (or appear) mixed selective, without requiring complex nonlinear readouts as in traditional theories. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.</description>

      <title>TEOChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Temporal Earth Observation Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision and language assistants have enabled new capabilities for interpreting natural images. These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than specialist models trained to perform these specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single EO image instruction-following model. We publicly release our data, models, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</description>

      <title>BUMBLE: Unifying Reasoning and Acting with Vision-Language Models for Building-wide Mobile Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To operate at a building scale, service robots must perform very long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks by navigating to different rooms, accessing different floors, and interacting with a wide and unseen range of everyday objects. We refer to these tasks as Building-wide Mobile Manipulation. To tackle these inherently long-horizon tasks, we introduce BUMBLE, a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework integrating open-world RGBD perception, a wide spectrum of gross-to-fine motor skills, and dual-layered memory. Our extensive evaluation (90+ hours) indicates that BUMBLE outperforms multiple baselines in long-horizon building-wide tasks that require sequencing up to 12 ground truth skills spanning 15 minutes per trial. BUMBLE achieves 47.1% success rate averaged over 70 trials in different buildings, tasks, and scene layouts from different starting rooms and floors. Our user study demonstrates 22% higher satisfaction with our method than state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of using increasingly-capable foundation models to push performance further. For more information, see https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/BUMBLE/</description>

      <title>EVOLvE: Evaluating and Optimizing LLMs For Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their success in many domains, large language models (LLMs) remain under-studied in scenarios requiring optimal decision-making under uncertainty. This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.</description>

      <title>Using Crank-Nikolson Scheme to Solve the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is a fundamental partial differential equation that models wave propagation in shallow water and other dispersive media. Accurately solving the KdV equation is essential for understanding wave dynamics in physics and engineering applications. This project focuses on implementing the Crank-Nicolson scheme, a finite difference method known for its stability and accuracy, to solve the KdV equation. The Crank-Nicolson scheme's implicit nature allows for a more stable numerical solution, especially in handling the dispersive and nonlinear terms of the KdV equation. We investigate the performance of the scheme through various test cases, analyzing its convergence and error behavior. The results demonstrate that the Crank-Nicolson method provides a robust approach for solving the KdV equation, with improved accuracy over traditional explicit methods. Code is available at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Model Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring model explainability and robustness is essential for reliable deployment of deep vision systems. Current methods for evaluating robustness rely on collecting and annotating extensive test sets. While this is common practice, the process is labor-intensive and expensive with no guarantee of sufficient coverage across attributes of interest. Recently, model diagnosis frameworks have emerged leveraging user inputs (e.g., text) to assess the vulnerability of the model. However, such dependence on human can introduce bias and limitation given the domain knowledge of particular users. This paper proposes Unsupervised Model Diagnosis (UMO), that leverages generative models to produce semantic counterfactual explanations without any user guidance. Given a differentiable computer vision model (i.e., the target model), UMO optimizes for the most counterfactual directions in a generative latent space. Our approach identifies and visualizes changes in semantics, and then matches these changes to attributes from wide-ranging text sources, such as dictionaries or language models. We validate the framework on multiple vision tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, keypoint detection). Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised discovery of semantic directions can correctly highlight spurious correlations and visualize the failure mode of target models without any human intervention.</description>

      <title>Think While You Generate: Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity. Code is available at https://github.com/liusulin/DDPD.</description>

      <title>Probing the Robustness of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the success of ChatGPT and other similarly sized SotA LLMs, claims of emergent human like social reasoning capabilities, especially Theory of Mind (ToM), in these models have appeared in the scientific literature. On the one hand those ToM-capabilities have been successfully tested using tasks styled similar to those used in psychology (Kosinski, 2023). On the other hand, follow up studies showed that those capabilities vanished when the tasks were slightly altered (Ullman, 2023). In this work we introduce a novel dataset of 68 tasks for probing ToM in LLMs, including potentially challenging variations which are assigned to 10 complexity classes. This way it is providing novel insights into the challenges LLMs face with those task variations. We evaluate the ToM performance of four SotA open source LLMs on our dataset and the dataset introduced by (Kosinski, 2023). The overall low goal accuracy across all evaluated models indicates only a limited degree of ToM capabilities. The LLMs' performance on simple complexity class tasks from both datasets are similar. Whereas we find a consistent tendency in all tested LLMs to perform poorly on tasks that require the realization that an agent has knowledge of automatic state changes in its environment, even when those are spelled out to the model. For task complications that change the relationship between objects by replacing prepositions, we notice a performance drop in all models, with the strongest impact on the mixture-of-experts model. With our dataset of tasks grouped by complexity we offer directions for further research on how to stabilize and advance ToM capabilities in LLM.</description>

      <title>Is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle all you need? Solving optimal control problems with PMP-inspired neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculus of Variations is the mathematics of functional optimization, i.e., when the solutions are functions over a time interval. This is particularly important when the time interval is unknown like in minimum-time control problems, so that forward in time solutions are not possible. Calculus of Variations offers a robust framework for learning optimal control and inference. How can this framework be leveraged to design neural networks to solve challenges in control and inference? We propose the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle Neural Network (PMP-net) that is tailored to estimate control and inference solutions, in accordance with the necessary conditions outlined by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We assess PMP-net on two classic optimal control and inference problems: optimal linear filtering and minimum-time control. Our findings indicate that PMP-net can be effectively trained in an unsupervised manner to solve these problems without the need for ground-truth data, successfully deriving the classical "Kalman filter" and "bang-bang" control solution. This establishes a new approach for addressing general, possibly yet unsolved, optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Non-Halting Queries: Exploiting Fixed Points in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new vulnerability that exploits fixed points in autoregressive models and use it to craft queries that never halt, i.e. an LLM output that does not terminate. More precisely, for what we call non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token (&lt;eos&gt;). We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) sequence of tokens is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt.
  We demonstrate the non-halting anomaly in a number of experiments performed in base (unaligned) models where repeating tokens immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We study the recipe behavior in bypassing alignment in a number of LLMs including GPT-4o, llama-3-8b-instruct, and gemma-2-9b-it where all models are forced into a non-halting state. Further, we demonstrate the recipe's success in sending most major models released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even at higher temperatures. Further, we study direct inversion based techniques to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. Our experiments with the gradient search based inversion technique ARCA show that non-halting is prevalent across models and may be easily induced with a few input tokens.
  While its impact on the reliability of hosted systems can be mitigated by configuring a hard maximum token limit in the sampler, the non-halting anomaly still manages to break alignment. This underlines the need for further studies and stronger forms of alignment against non-halting anomalies.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Preference Optimization for Large Language Model Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal tool for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), one of the most popular approaches, formulates RLHF as a policy optimization problem without explicitly estimating the reward function. It overcomes the stability and efficiency issues of two-step approaches, which typically involve first estimating the reward function and then optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Since RLHF is essentially an optimization problem, and it is well-known that momentum techniques can accelerate optimization both theoretically and empirically, a natural question arises: Can RLHF be accelerated by momentum? This paper answers this question in the affirmative. In detail, we first show that the iterative preference optimization method can be viewed as a proximal point method. Based on this observation, we propose a general Accelerated Preference Optimization (APO) framework, which unifies many existing preference optimization algorithms and employs Nesterov's momentum technique to speed up the alignment of LLMs. Theoretically, we demonstrate that APO can achieve a faster convergence rate than the standard iterative preference optimization methods, including DPO and Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO). Empirically, we show the superiority of APO over DPO, iterative DPO, and other strong baselines for RLHF on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle a challenging and extreme form of subpopulation shift, which is termed compositional shift. Under compositional shifts, some combinations of attributes are totally absent from the training distribution but present in the test distribution. We model the data with flexible additive energy distributions, where each energy term represents an attribute, and derive a simple alternative to empirical risk minimization termed compositional risk minimization (CRM). We first train an additive energy classifier to predict the multiple attributes and then adjust this classifier to tackle compositional shifts. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of CRM, where we show that our proposal extrapolates to special affine hulls of seen attribute combinations. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirms the improved robustness of CRM compared to other methods from the literature designed to tackle various forms of subpopulation shifts.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Hybrid Models in Health Misinformation Text Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in detecting COVID-19-related misinformation on online social networks (OSNs), aiming to develop more effective tools for countering the spread of health misinformation during the pan-demic. The study trained and tested various ML classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), DL models (CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN+LSTM), and pretrained language models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on the "COVID19-FNIR DATASET". These models were evaluated for accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, and ROC, and used preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization. The results showed SVM performed well, achieving a 94.41% F1-score. DL models with Word2Vec embeddings exceeded 98% in all performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision &amp; ROC). The CNN+LSTM hybrid models also exceeded 98% across performance metrics, outperforming pretrained models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa. Our study concludes that DL and hybrid DL models are more effective than conventional ML algorithms for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on OSNs. The findings highlight the importance of advanced neural network approaches and large-scale pretraining in misinformation detection. Future research should optimize these models for various misinformation types and adapt to changing OSNs, aiding in combating health misinformation.</description>

      <title>Learning in complex action spaces without policy gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods. However, foundational studies have shown equivalences between these paradigms in small and finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm, but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods to serve similar functionality. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces with a controllable computational cost that is comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE demonstrates strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.</description>

      <title>Auto-Evolve: Enhancing Large Language Model's Performance via Self-Reasoning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt engineering strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Discover, have demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompting strategies rely on single or fixed set of static seed reasoning modules like \emph{"think step by step"} or \emph{"break down this problem"} intended to simulate human approach to problem-solving. This constraint limits the flexibility of models in tackling diverse problems effectively. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Evolve, a novel framework that enables LLMs to self-create dynamic reasoning modules and downstream action plan, resulting in significant improvements over current SOTA methods. We evaluate Auto-Evolve on the challenging BigBench-Hard (BBH) dataset with Claude 2.0, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and GPT 4, where it consistently outperforms the SOTA prompt strategies. Auto-Evolve outperforms CoT by up to 10.4\% and on an average by 7\% across these four models. Our framework introduces two innovations: a) Auto-Evolve dynamically generates reasoning modules for each task while aligning with human reasoning paradigm, thus eliminating the need for predefined templates. b) We introduce an iterative refinement component, that incrementally refines instruction guidance for LLMs and helps boost performance by average 2.8\% compared to doing it in a single step.</description>

      <title>Locate-then-edit for Multi-hop Factual Recall under Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve implicit subject knowledge from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on earlier layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. IFMET employs multi-hop editing prompts and supplementary sets to locate and modify knowledge across different reasoning stages. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, effectively overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods.</description>

      <title>Solving Multi-Goal Robotic Tasks with Decision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in robotics, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as one of the most promising approaches for robot control. However, several key challenges hinder its broader application. First, many RL methods rely on online learning, which requires either real-world hardware or advanced simulation environments--both of which can be costly, time-consuming, and impractical. Offline reinforcement learning offers a solution, enabling models to be trained without ongoing access to physical robots or simulations.
  A second challenge is learning multi-goal tasks, where robots must achieve multiple objectives simultaneously. This adds complexity to the training process, as the model must generalize across different goals. At the same time, transformer architectures have gained significant popularity across various domains, including reinforcement learning. Yet, no existing methods effectively combine offline training, multi-goal learning, and transformer-based architectures.
  In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel adaptation of the decision transformer architecture for offline multi-goal reinforcement learning in robotics. Our approach integrates goal-specific information into the decision transformer, allowing it to handle complex tasks in an offline setting. To validate our method, we developed a new offline reinforcement learning dataset using the Panda robotic platform in simulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the decision transformer can outperform state-of-the-art online reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Command Understanding for Tabletop Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm designed to interpret natural human commands in tabletop scenarios. By integrating multiple sources of information, including speech, gestures, and scene context, the system extracts actionable instructions for a robot, identifying relevant objects and actions. The system operates in a zero-shot fashion, without reliance on predefined object models, enabling flexible and adaptive use in various environments. We assess the integration of multiple deep learning models, evaluating their suitability for deployment in real-world robotic setups. Our algorithm performs robustly across different tasks, combining language processing with visual grounding. In addition, we release a small dataset of video recordings used to evaluate the system. This dataset captures real-world interactions in which a human provides instructions in natural language to a robot, a contribution to future research on human-robot interaction. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the system, with particular focus on how it handles multimodal command interpretation, and its ability to be integrated into symbolic robotic frameworks for safe and explainable decision-making.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Regularization for Domain-Agnostic Dynamical System Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning complex physical dynamics purely from data is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of systems to be satisfied. Incorporating physics-informed priors, such as in Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), achieves high-precision modeling for energy-conservative systems. However, real-world systems often deviate from strict energy conservation and follow different physical priors. To address this, we present a framework that achieves high-precision modeling for a wide range of dynamical systems from the numerical aspect, by enforcing Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) via a novel regularization term. It helps preserve energies for conservative systems while serving as a strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. While TRS is a domain-specific physical prior, we present the first theoretical proof that TRS loss can universally improve modeling accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, which is numerically beneficial to various systems regardless of their properties, even for irreversible systems. By integrating the TRS loss within neural ordinary differential equation models, the proposed model TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse physical systems. It achieves a significant 11.5% MSE improvement in a challenging chaotic triple-pendulum scenario, underscoring TREAT's broad applicability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>HumVI: A Multilingual Dataset for Detecting Violent Incidents Impacting Humanitarian Aid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/dataminr-ai/humvi-dataset.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning for Heterogeneous Teams of Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous teams of mobile robots for tasks such as search and rescue is highly challenging. This is due to the complexities of perception, decision making and planning in such environments, with agents' non-synchronous operation, constrained communication, and limited computational resources. This paper presents the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to effectively coordinate agents with heterogeneous sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities. The framework introduces a Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMD-POMDP) model to handle asynchronous decision-making among different agent classes via macro-actions. It also extends the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) architecture to facilitate distributed, ad hoc communication among the agents. CATMiP easily adapts to mission complexities and communication constraints, and scales to varying environment sizes and team compositions. Simulations demonstrate its scalability and ability to achieve cooperative mission objectives with two classes of explorer and rescuer agents, even under severe communication constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/mylad13/CATMiP.</description>

      <title>Covering Numbers for Deep ReLU Networks with Applications to Function Approximation and Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covering numbers of families of (deep) ReLU networks have been used to characterize their approximation-theoretic performance, upper-bound the prediction error they incur in nonparametric regression, and quantify their classification capacity. These results are based on covering number upper bounds obtained through the explicit construction of coverings. Lower bounds on covering numbers do not seem to be available in the literature. The present paper fills this gap by deriving tight (up to a multiplicative constant) lower and upper bounds on the covering numbers of fully-connected networks with bounded weights, sparse networks with bounded weights, and fully-connected networks with quantized weights. Thanks to the tightness of the bounds, a fundamental understanding of the impact of sparsity, quantization, bounded vs. unbounded weights, and network output truncation can be developed. Furthermore, the bounds allow to characterize the fundamental limits of neural network transformation, including network compression, and lead to sharp upper bounds on the prediction error in nonparametric regression through deep networks. Specifically, we can remove a $\log^6(n)$-factor in the best-known sample complexity rate in the estimation of Lipschitz functions through deep networks thereby establishing optimality. Finally, we identify a systematic relation between optimal nonparametric regression and optimal approximation through deep networks, unifying numerous results in the literature and uncovering general underlying principles.</description>

      <title>Skin Cancer Machine Learning Model Tone Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Many open-source skin cancer image datasets are the result of clinical trials conducted in countries with lighter skin tones. Due to this tone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform well at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these models could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the artificial intelligence health field.
  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a significant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias. To address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional neural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then evaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to dark or light skin tone.
  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in a disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the model is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter versus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or balanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well below the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with respect to skin tone.
  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models can be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone imbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to identify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning train neural networks by levergaing data from heterogeneous sources such as images and text. Yet, many current multimodal learning architectures cannot generalize to an arbitrary number of modalities and need to be hand-constructed. We propose AutoBIND, a novel contrastive learning framework that can learn representations from an arbitrary number of modalites through graph optimization. We evaluate AutoBIND on Alzhiemer's disease detection because it has real-world medical applicability and it contains a broad range of data modalities. We show that AutoBIND outperforms previous methods on this task, highlighting the generalizablility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus with Vision Transformers: the Importance of 2D Representation, Positions, and Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Biased AI can Influence Political Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern AI models become integral to everyday tasks, concerns about their inherent biases and their potential impact on human decision-making have emerged. While bias in models are well-documented, less is known about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two interactive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in AI language models on political decision-making. Participants interacted freely with either a biased liberal, conservative, or unbiased control model while completing political decision-making tasks. We found that participants exposed to politically biased models were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions aligning with the AI's bias, regardless of their personal political partisanship. However, we also discovered that prior knowledge about AI could lessen the impact of the bias, highlighting the possible importance of AI education for robust bias mitigation. Our findings not only highlight the critical effects of interacting with biased AI and its ability to impact public discourse and political conduct, but also highlights potential techniques for mitigating these risks in the future.</description>

      <title>FAIREDU: A Multiple Regression-Based Method for Enhancing Fairness in Machine Learning Models for Educational Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models is becoming critically important, especially as decisions made by these systems impact diverse groups. In education, a vital sector for all countries, the widespread application of AI/ML systems raises specific concerns regarding fairness. Current research predominantly focuses on fairness for individual sensitive features, which limits the comprehensiveness of fairness assessments. This paper introduces FAIREDU, a novel and effective method designed to improve fairness across multiple sensitive features. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate FAIREDU effectiveness in enhancing fairness without compromising model performance. The results demonstrate that FAIREDU addresses intersectionality across features such as gender, race, age, and other sensitive features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal effect on model accuracy. The paper also explores potential future research directions to enhance further the method robustness and applicability to various machine-learning models and datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to predict toxicity and other textual attributes through the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for two recent events: the Ukraine-Russia and Hamas-Israel conflicts. This article provides a basis for exploration in future conflicts with hopes to mitigate risk through the analysis of social media before and after a conflict begins. Our work compiles several datasets from Twitter and Reddit for both conflicts in a before and after separation with an aim of predicting a future state of social media for avoidance. More specifically, we show that: (1) there is a noticeable difference in social media discussion leading up to and following a conflict and (2) social media discourse on platforms like Twitter and Reddit is useful in identifying future conflicts before they arise. Our results show that through the use of advanced NLP techniques (both supervised and unsupervised) toxicity and other attributes about language before and after a conflict is predictable with a low error of nearly 1.2 percent for both conflicts.</description>

      <title>Stress Detection on Code-Mixed Texts in Dravidian Languages using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress is a common feeling in daily life, but it can affect mental well-being in some situations, the development of robust detection models is imperative. This study introduces a methodical approach to the stress identification in code-mixed texts for Dravidian languages. The challenge encompassed two datasets, targeting Tamil and Telugu languages respectively. This proposal underscores the importance of using uncleaned text as a benchmark to refine future classification methodologies, incorporating diverse preprocessing techniques. Random Forest algorithm was used, featuring three textual representations: TF-IDF, Uni-grams of words, and a composite of (1+2+3)-Grams of characters. The approach achieved a good performance for both linguistic categories, achieving a Macro F1-score of 0.734 in Tamil and 0.727 in Telugu, overpassing results achieved with different complex techniques such as FastText and Transformer models. The results underscore the value of uncleaned data for mental state detection and the challenges classifying code-mixed texts for stress, indicating the potential for improved performance through cleaning data, other preprocessing techniques, or more complex models.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown that even trained with noisy prior data, they can generalize effectively to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) and pre-training techniques. Motivated by this, we explore whether a similar approach can be applied to scientific foundation models (SFMs). Our methodology is structured as follows: (i) we collect low-cost physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based approximated prior data in the form of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) constructed through an arbitrary linear combination of mathematical dictionaries; (ii) we utilize Transformer architectures with self and cross-attention mechanisms to predict PDE solutions without knowledge of the governing equations in a zero-shot setting; (iii) we provide experimental evidence on the one-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equation, which demonstrate that pre-training remains robust even with approximated prior data, with only marginal impacts on test accuracy. Notably, this finding opens the path to pre-training SFMs with realistic, low-cost data instead of (or in conjunction with) numerical high-cost data. These results support the conjecture that SFMs can improve in a manner similar to LLMs, where fully cleaning the vast set of sentences crawled from the Internet is nearly impossible.</description>

      <title>Modeling chaotic Lorenz ODE System using Scientific Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In climate science, models for global warming and weather prediction face significant challenges due to the limited availability of high-quality data and the difficulty in obtaining it, making data efficiency crucial. In the past few years, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) models have gained tremendous traction as they can be trained in a data-efficient manner, making them highly suitable for real-world climate applications. Despite this, very little attention has been paid to chaotic climate system modeling utilizing SciML methods. In this paper, we have integrated SciML methods into foundational weather models, where we have enhanced large-scale climate predictions with a physics-informed approach that achieves high accuracy with reduced data. We successfully demonstrate that by combining the interpretability of physical climate models with the computational power of neural networks, SciML models can prove to be a reliable tool for modeling climate. This indicates a shift from the traditional black box-based machine learning modeling of climate systems to physics-informed decision-making, leading to effective climate policy implementation.</description>

      <title>LLM Self-Correction with DeCRIM: Decompose, Critique, and Refine for Enhanced Following of Instructions with Multiple Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction following is a key capability for LLMs. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs often struggle with instructions containing multiple constraints (e.g. a request to create a social media post "in a funny tone" with "no hashtag"). Despite this, most evaluations focus solely on synthetic data. To address this, we introduce RealInstruct, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to follow real-world multi-constrained instructions by leveraging queries real users asked AI assistants. We also investigate model-based evaluation as a cost-effective alternative to human annotation for this task. Our findings reveal that even the proprietary GPT-4 model fails to meet at least one constraint on over 21% of instructions, highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art models. To address the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, we propose the Decompose, Critique and Refine (DeCRIM) self-correction pipeline, which enhances LLMs' ability to follow constraints. DeCRIM works by decomposing the original instruction into a list of constraints and using a Critic model to decide when and where the LLM's response needs refinement. Our results show that DeCRIM improves Mistral's performance by 7.3% on RealInstruct and 8.0% on IFEval even with weak feedback. Moreover, we demonstrate that with strong feedback, open-source LLMs with DeCRIM can outperform GPT-4 on both benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Hallucinating AI Hijacking Attack: Large Language Models and Malicious Code Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research builds and evaluates the adversarial potential to introduce copied code or hallucinated AI recommendations for malicious code in popular code repositories. While foundational large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic guard against both harmful behaviors and toxic strings, previous work on math solutions that embed harmful prompts demonstrate that the guardrails may differ between expert contexts. These loopholes would appear in mixture of expert's models when the context of the question changes and may offer fewer malicious training examples to filter toxic comments or recommended offensive actions. The present work demonstrates that foundational models may refuse to propose destructive actions correctly when prompted overtly but may unfortunately drop their guard when presented with a sudden change of context, like solving a computer programming challenge. We show empirical examples with trojan-hosting repositories like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and popular content delivery networks (CDN) like jsDelivr which amplify the attack surface. In the LLM's directives to be helpful, example recommendations propose application programming interface (API) endpoints which a determined domain-squatter could acquire and setup attack mobile infrastructure that triggers from the naively copied code. We compare this attack to previous work on context-shifting and contrast the attack surface as a novel version of "living off the land" attacks in the malware literature. In the latter case, foundational language models can hijack otherwise innocent user prompts to recommend actions that violate their owners' safety policies when posed directly without the accompanying coding support request.</description>

      <title>Enabling Novel Mission Operations and Interactions with ROSA: The Robot Operating System Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of robotic systems has revolutionized numerous industries, yet their operation often demands specialized technical knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-expert users. This paper introduces ROSA (Robot Operating System Agent), an AI-powered agent that bridges the gap between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and natural language interfaces. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models and integrating open-source frameworks, ROSA enables operators to interact with robots using natural language, translating commands into actions and interfacing with ROS through well-defined tools. ROSA's design is modular and extensible, offering seamless integration with both ROS1 and ROS2, along with safety mechanisms like parameter validation and constraint enforcement to ensure secure, reliable operations. While ROSA is originally designed for ROS, it can be extended to work with other robotics middle-wares to maximize compatibility across missions. ROSA enhances human-robot interaction by democratizing access to complex robotic systems, empowering users of all expertise levels with multi-modal capabilities such as speech integration and visual perception. Ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed, guided by foundational principles like Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, ensuring that AI integration promotes safety, transparency, privacy, and accountability. By making robotic technology more user-friendly and accessible, ROSA not only improves operational efficiency but also sets a new standard for responsible AI use in robotics and potentially future mission operations. This paper introduces ROSA's architecture and showcases initial mock-up operations in JPL's Mars Yard, a laboratory, and a simulation using three different robots. The core ROSA library is available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Grounding Robot Policies with Visuomotor Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision have shown great potential in understanding the underlying dynamics of the world from large-scale internet data. However, translating this knowledge into robotic systems remains an open challenge, given the scarcity of human-robot interactions and the lack of large-scale datasets of real-world robotic data. Previous robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great capabilities in learning robotic skills from human demonstrations or from scratch in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for new settings. Aiming to address these limitations, we propose an agent-based framework for grounding robot policies to the current context, considering the constraints of a current robot and its environment using visuomotor-grounded language guidance. The proposed framework is composed of a set of conversational agents designed for specific roles -- namely, high-level advisor, visual grounding, monitoring, and robotic agents. Given a base policy, the agents collectively generate guidance at run time to shift the action distribution of the base policy towards more desirable future states. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates both in simulation and in real-world experiments without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

      <title>OledFL: Unleashing the Potential of Decentralized Federated Learning via Opposite Lookahead Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) surpasses Centralized Federated Learning (CFL) in terms of faster training, privacy preservation, and light communication, making it a promising alternative in the field of federated learning. However, DFL still exhibits significant disparities with CFL in terms of generalization ability such as rarely theoretical understanding and degraded empirical performance due to severe inconsistency. In this paper, we enhance the consistency of DFL by developing an opposite lookahead enhancement technique (Ole), yielding OledFL to optimize the initialization of each client in each communication round, thus significantly improving both the generalization and convergence speed. Moreover, we rigorously establish its convergence rate in non-convex setting and characterize its generalization bound through uniform stability, which provides concrete reasons why OledFL can achieve both the fast convergence speed and high generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with Dirichlet and Pathological distributions illustrate that our OledFL can achieve up to 5\% performance improvement and 8$\times$ speedup, compared to the most popular DFedAvg optimizer in DFL.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Ensemble for Predicting Diabetic Macular Edema Onset Using Ultra-Wide Field Color Fundus Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of diabetes, characterized by thickening of the central portion of the retina due to accumulation of fluid. DME is a significant and common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients. Center-involved DME (ci-DME) is the highest risk form of disease as fluid extends close to the fovea which is responsible for sharp central vision. Earlier diagnosis or prediction of ci-DME may improve treatment outcomes. Here, we propose an ensemble method to predict ci-DME onset within a year using ultra-wide-field color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) images provided by the DIAMOND Challenge. We adopted a variety of baseline state-of-the-art classification networks including ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG with the aim of enhancing model robustness. The best performing models were Densenet 121, Resnet 152 and EfficientNet b7, and these were assembled into a definitive predictive model. The final ensemble model demonstrates a strong performance with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.7017, an F1 score of 0.6512, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.2057 when deployed on a synthetic dataset. The performance of this ensemble model is comparable to previous studies despite training and testing in a more realistic setting, indicating the potential of UWF-CFP combined with a deep learning classification system to facilitate earlier diagnosis, better treatment decisions, and improved prognostication in ci-DME.</description>

      <title>FedL2G: Learning to Guide Local Training in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data and model heterogeneity are two core issues in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL). In scenarios with heterogeneous model architectures, aggregating model parameters becomes infeasible, leading to the use of prototypes (i.e., class representative feature vectors) for aggregation and guidance. However, they still experience a mismatch between the extra guiding objective and the client's original local objective when aligned with global prototypes. Thus, we propose a Federated Learning-to-Guide (FedL2G) method that adaptively learns to guide local training in a federated manner and ensures the extra guidance is beneficial to clients' original tasks. With theoretical guarantees, FedL2G efficiently implements the learning-to-guide process using only first-order derivatives w.r.t. model parameters and achieves a non-convex convergence rate of O(1/T). We conduct extensive experiments on two data heterogeneity and six model heterogeneity settings using 14 heterogeneous model architectures (e.g., CNNs and ViTs) to demonstrate FedL2G's superior performance compared to six counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Bidirectional Clustered MPPI (BiC-MPPI) algorithm, a novel trajectory optimization method aimed at enhancing goal-directed guidance within the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) framework. BiC-MPPI incorporates bidirectional dynamics approximations and a new guide cost mechanism, improving both trajectory planning and goal-reaching performance. By leveraging forward and backward rollouts, the bidirectional approach ensures effective trajectory connections between initial and terminal states, while the guide cost helps discover dynamically feasible paths. Experimental results demonstrate that BiC-MPPI outperforms existing MPPI variants in both 2D and 3D environments, achieving higher success rates and competitive computation times across 900 simulations on a modified BARN dataset for autonomous navigation.

      <title>ERCache: An Efficient and Reliable Caching Framework for Large-Scale User Representations in Meta's Ads System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</description>

      <title>TorchTitan: One-stop PyTorch native solution for production ready LLM pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort.
  This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences.
  We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.</description>

      <title>QuadBEV: An Efficient Quadruple-Task Perception Framework via Bird's-Eye-View Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception has become a vital component of autonomous driving systems due to its ability to integrate multiple sensor inputs into a unified representation, enhancing performance in various downstream tasks. However, the computational demands of BEV models pose challenges for real-world deployment in vehicles with limited resources. To address these limitations, we propose QuadBEV, an efficient multitask perception framework that leverages the shared spatial and contextual information across four key tasks: 3D object detection, lane detection, map segmentation, and occupancy prediction. QuadBEV not only streamlines the integration of these tasks using a shared backbone and task-specific heads but also addresses common multitask learning challenges such as learning rate sensitivity and conflicting task objectives. Our framework reduces redundant computations, thereby enhancing system efficiency, making it particularly suited for embedded systems. We present comprehensive experiments that validate the effectiveness and robustness of QuadBEV, demonstrating its suitability for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>

      <title>Do great minds think alike? Investigating Human-AI Complementarity in Question Answering with CAIMIRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have led to claims of AI surpassing humans in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as textual understanding and reasoning. This work investigates these assertions by introducing CAIMIRA, a novel framework rooted in item response theory (IRT) that enables quantitative assessment and comparison of problem-solving abilities of question-answering (QA) agents: humans and AI systems. Through analysis of over 300,000 responses from ~70 AI systems and 155 humans across thousands of quiz questions, CAIMIRA uncovers distinct proficiency patterns in knowledge domains and reasoning skills. Humans outperform AI systems in knowledge-grounded abductive and conceptual reasoning, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA show superior performance on targeted information retrieval and fact-based reasoning, particularly when information gaps are well-defined and addressable through pattern matching or data retrieval. These findings highlight the need for future QA tasks to focus on questions that challenge not only higher-order reasoning and scientific thinking, but also demand nuanced linguistic interpretation and cross-contextual knowledge application, helping advance AI developments that better emulate or complement human cognitive abilities in real-world problem-solving.</description>

      <title>The Sampling-Gaussian for stereo matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft-argmax operation is widely adopted in neural network-based stereo matching methods to enable differentiable regression of disparity. However, network trained with soft-argmax is prone to being multimodal due to absence of explicit constraint to the shape of the probability distribution. Previous methods leverages Laplacian distribution and cross-entropy for training but failed to effectively improve the accuracy and even compromises the efficiency of the network. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the previous distribution-based methods and propose a novel supervision method for stereo matching, Sampling-Gaussian. We sample from the Gaussian distribution for supervision. Moreover, we interpret the training as minimizing the distance in vector space and propose a combined loss of L1 loss and cosine similarity loss. Additionally, we leveraged bilinear interpolation to upsample the cost volume. Our method can be directly applied to any soft-argmax-based stereo matching method without a reduction in efficiency. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our Sampling-Gaussian. The experimental results prove that we have achieved better accuracy on five baseline methods and two datasets. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is available online.</description>

      <title>TopoTune : A Framework for Generalized Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in learning from relational datasets, processing node and edge features in a way that preserves the symmetries of the graph domain. However, many complex systems--such as biological or social networks--involve multiway complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological spaces. The emerging field of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) aims to accommodate and leverage these higher-order structures. Combinatorial Complex Neural Networks (CCNNs), fairly general TDL models, have been shown to be more expressive and better performing than GNNs. However, differently from the graph deep learning ecosystem, TDL lacks a principled and standardized framework for easily defining new architectures, restricting its accessibility and applicability. To address this issue, we introduce Generalized CCNNs (GCCNs), a novel simple yet powerful family of TDL models that can be used to systematically transform any (graph) neural network into its TDL counterpart. We prove that GCCNs generalize and subsume CCNNs, while extensive experiments on a diverse class of GCCNs show that these architectures consistently match or outperform CCNNs, often with less model complexity. In an effort to accelerate and democratize TDL, we introduce TopoTune, a lightweight software that allows practitioners to define, build, and train GCCNs with unprecedented flexibility and ease.</description>

      <title>Chip-Tuning: Classify Before Language Models Say</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development in the performance of large language models (LLMs) is accompanied by the escalation of model size, leading to the increasing cost of model training and inference. Previous research has discovered that certain layers in LLMs exhibit redundancy, and removing these layers brings only marginal loss in model performance. In this paper, we adopt the probing technique to explain the layer redundancy in LLMs and demonstrate that language models can be effectively pruned with probing classifiers. We propose chip-tuning, a simple and effective structured pruning framework specialized for classification problems. Chip-tuning attaches tiny probing classifiers named chips to different layers of LLMs, and trains chips with the backbone model frozen. After selecting a chip for classification, all layers subsequent to the attached layer could be removed with marginal performance loss. Experimental results on various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that chip-tuning significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and pruning ratio, achieving a pruning ratio of up to 50%. We also find that chip-tuning could be applied on multimodal models, and could be combined with model finetuning, proving its excellent compatibility.</description>

      <title>DiffGAD: A Diffusion-based Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is crucial for identifying abnormal entities within networks, garnering significant attention across various fields. Traditional unsupervised methods, which decode encoded latent representations of unlabeled data with a reconstruction focus, often fail to capture critical discriminative content, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we present a Diffusion-based Graph Anomaly Detector (DiffGAD). At the heart of DiffGAD is a novel latent space learning paradigm, meticulously designed to enhance its proficiency by guiding it with discriminative content. This innovative approach leverages diffusion sampling to infuse the latent space with discriminative content and introduces a content-preservation mechanism that retains valuable information across different scales, significantly improving its adeptness at identifying anomalies with limited time and space complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of DiffGAD, conducted on six real-world and large-scale datasets with various metrics, demonstrated its exceptional performance.</description>

      <title>Investigating Cost-Efficiency of LLM-Generated Training Data for Conversational Semantic Frame Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that few-shot learning allows LLMs to generate training data for supervised models at a low cost. However, the quality of LLM-generated data may not entirely match that of human-labeled data. This raises a crucial question: how should one balance the trade-off between the higher quality but more expensive human data and the lower quality yet substantially cheaper LLM-generated data? In this paper, we synthesized training data for conversational semantic frame analysis using GPT-4 and examined how to allocate budgets optimally to achieve the best performance. Our experiments, conducted across various budget levels, reveal that optimal cost-efficiency is achieved by combining both human and LLM-generated data across a wide range of budget levels. Notably, as the budget decreases, a higher proportion of LLM-generated data becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>InstantIR: Blind Image Restoration with Instant Generative Reference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling test-time unknown degradation is the major challenge in Blind Image Restoration (BIR), necessitating high model generalization. An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</description>

      <title>The Accuracy Paradox in RLHF: When Better Reward Models Don't Yield Better Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback significantly enhances Natural Language Processing by aligning language models with human expectations. A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

      <title>Mitigating Time Discretization Challenges with WeatherODE: A Sandwich Physics-Driven Neural ODE for Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of weather forecasting, traditional models often grapple with discretization errors and time-dependent source discrepancies, which limit their predictive performance. In this paper, we present WeatherODE, a novel one-stage, physics-driven ordinary differential equation (ODE) model designed to enhance weather forecasting accuracy. By leveraging wave equation theory and integrating a time-dependent source model, WeatherODE effectively addresses the challenges associated with time-discretization error and dynamic atmospheric processes. Moreover, we design a CNN-ViT-CNN sandwich structure, facilitating efficient learning dynamics tailored for distinct yet interrelated tasks with varying optimization biases in advection equation estimation. Through rigorous experiments, WeatherODE demonstrates superior performance in both global and regional weather forecasting tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins of over 40.0\% and 31.8\% in root mean square error (RMSE), respectively.

      <title>Efficient and Robust Knowledge Distillation from A Stronger Teacher Based on Correlation Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a pivotal technique for neural network compression and performance enhancement. Most KD methods aim to transfer dark knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. However, the student performance improvements achieved through KD exhibit diminishing marginal returns, where a stronger teacher model does not necessarily lead to a proportionally stronger student model. To address this issue, we empirically find that the KL-based KD method may implicitly change the inter-class relationships learned by the student model, resulting in a more complex and ambiguous decision boundary, which in turn reduces the model's accuracy and generalization ability. Therefore, this study argues that the student model should learn not only the probability values from the teacher's output but also the relative ranking of classes, and proposes a novel Correlation Matching Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) method that combines the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients-based KD loss to achieve more efficient and robust distillation from a stronger teacher model. Moreover, considering that samples vary in difficulty, CMKD dynamically adjusts the weights of the Pearson-based loss and Spearman-based loss. CMKD is simple yet practical, and extensive experiments demonstrate that it can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIRAR-100 and ImageNet, and adapts well to various teacher architectures, sizes, and other KD methods.</description>

      <title>Pair-VPR: Place-Aware Pre-training and Contrastive Pair Classification for Visual Place Recognition with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel joint training method for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which simultaneously learns a global descriptor and a pair classifier for re-ranking. The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

      <description>arXiv:2410.06617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning.</description>

Abstract: Traditional information theory provides a valuable foundation for Reinforcement Learning, particularly through representation learning and entropy maximization for agent exploration. However, existing methods primarily concentrate on modeling the uncertainty associated with RL's random variables, neglecting the inherent structure within the state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based Effective Exploration framework, namely SI2E. Structural mutual information between two variables is defined to address the single-variable limitation in structural information, and an innovative embedding principle is presented to capture dynamics-relevant state-action representations. The SI2E analyzes value differences in the agent's policy between state-action pairs and minimizes structural entropy to derive the hierarchical state-action structure, referred to as the encoding tree. Under this tree structure, value-conditional structural entropy is defined and maximized to design an intrinsic reward mechanism that avoids redundant transitions and promotes enhanced coverage in the state-action space. Theoretical connections are established between SI2E and classical information-theoretic methodologies, highlighting our framework's rationality and advantage. Comprehensive evaluations in the MiniGrid, MetaWorld, and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that SI2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration baselines regarding final performance and sample efficiency, with maximum improvements of 37.63% and 60.25%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Subtle Errors Matter: Preference Learning via Error-injected Self-editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning and computational prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the models' full mathematical potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve distilling reasoning skills from stronger LLMs or applying preference learning to step-wise response pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook the frequently occurring subtle errors. A major reason is that sampled preference pairs involve differences unrelated to the errors, which may distract the model from focusing on subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into partial tokens of correct solutions to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the model itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective to focus on predefined errors and their tokens, without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH.</description>

      <title>Toward Physics-guided Time Series Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In various scientific and engineering fields, the primary research areas have revolved around physics-based dynamical systems modeling and data-driven time series analysis. According to the embedding theory, dynamical systems and time series can be mutually transformed using observation functions and physical reconstruction techniques. Based on this, we propose Embedding Duality Theory, where the parameterized embedding layer essentially provides a linear estimation of the non-linear time series dynamics. This theory enables us to bypass the parameterized embedding layer and directly employ physical reconstruction techniques to acquire a data embedding representation. Utilizing physical priors results in a 10X reduction in parameters, a 3X increase in speed, and maximum performance boosts of 18% in expert, 22% in few-shot, and 53\% in zero-shot tasks without any hyper-parameter tuning. All methods are encapsulated as a plug-and-play module</description>

      <title>Task-oriented Time Series Imputation Evaluation via Generalized Representers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis is widely used in many fields such as power energy, economics, and transportation, including different tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, etc. Missing values are widely observed in these tasks, and often leading to unpredictable negative effects on existing methods, hindering their further application. In response to this situation, existing time series imputation methods mainly focus on restoring sequences based on their data characteristics, while ignoring the performance of the restored sequences in downstream tasks. Considering different requirements of downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting), this paper proposes an efficient downstream task-oriented time series imputation evaluation approach. By combining time series imputation with neural network models used for downstream tasks, the gain of different imputation strategies on downstream tasks is estimated without retraining, and the most favorable imputation value for downstream tasks is given by combining different imputation strategies according to the estimated gain.</description>

      <title>Decouple-Then-Merge: Towards Better Training for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are trained by learning a sequence of models that reverse each step of noise corruption. Typically, the model parameters are fully shared across multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the denoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different timesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image generation. To solve this issue, this work proposes a Decouple-then-Merge (DeMe) framework, which begins with a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific timesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage to promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference across timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be merged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and practical inference. Experimental results show significant generation quality improvements upon 6 benchmarks including Stable Diffusion on COCO30K, ImageNet1K, PartiPrompts, and DDPM on LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, and CIFAR10.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-Permutation Equivariance through the Lens of Irreducible Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the characterization of equivariant linear layers for representations of permutations and related groups. Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results.
  Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Irreducible-Representations-of-Deep-Weight-Spaces}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Code Executors: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly evolved, extending from natural language processing to complex tasks like code understanding and generation. We expand the scope of LLMs' capabilities to a broader context, using LLMs to execute code snippets to obtain the output. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs as code executors, where code snippets are directly fed to the models for execution, and outputs are returned. We are the first to comprehensively examine this feasibility across various LLMs, including OpenAI's o1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder. Notably, the o1 model achieved over 90% accuracy in code execution, while others demonstrated lower accuracy levels. Furthermore, we introduce an Iterative Instruction Prompting (IIP) technique that processes code snippets line by line, enhancing the accuracy of weaker models by an average of 7.22% (with the highest improvement of 18.96%) and an absolute average improvement of 3.86% against CoT prompting (with the highest improvement of 19.46%). Our study not only highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in coding but also lays the groundwork for future advancements in automated programming and the completion of complex tasks.</description>

      <title>M${}^{3}$Bench: Benchmarking Whole-body Motion Generation for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose M^3Bench, a new benchmark for whole-body motion generation for mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M^3Bench requires an embodied agent to understand its configuration, environmental constraints and task objectives, then generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement tasks. M^3Bench features 30k object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M^3BenchMaker. This automatic data generation tool produces coordinated whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions, requiring only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark incorporates various task splits to assess generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory evaluation. Through extensive experimental analyses, we reveal that state-of-the-art models still struggle with coordinated base-arm motion while adhering to environment-context and task-specific constraints, highlighting the need to develop new models that address this gap. Through M^3Bench, we aim to facilitate future robotics research towards more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.</description>

      <title>AI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We live in a world that is experiencing an unprecedented boom of AI applications that increasingly penetrate and enhance all sectors of private and public life, from education, media, medicine, and mobility to the industrial and professional workspace, and -- potentially particularly consequentially -- robotics. As this world is simultaneously grappling with climate change, the climate and environmental implications of the development and use of AI have become an important subject of public and academic debate. In this paper, we aim to provide guidance on the climate-related regulation for data centers and AI specifically, and discuss how to operationalize these requirements. We also highlight challenges and room for improvement, and make a number of policy proposals to this end. In particular, we propose a specific interpretation of the AI Act to bring reporting on the previously unadressed energy consumption from AI inferences back into the scope. We also find that the AI Act fails to address indirect greenhouse gas emissions from AI applications. Furthermore, for the purpose of energy consumption reporting, we compare levels of measurement within data centers and recommend measurement at the cumulative server level. We also argue for an interpretation of the AI Act that includes environmental concerns in the mandatory risk assessment (sustainability risk assessment, SIA), and provide guidance on its operationalization. The EU data center regulation proves to be a good first step but requires further development by including binding renewable energy and efficiency targets for data centers. Overall, we make twelve concrete policy proposals, in four main areas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.</description>

      <title>Break the Visual Perception: Adversarial Attacks Targeting Encoded Visual Tokens of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) integrate visual information into large language models, showcasing remarkable multi-modal conversational capabilities. However, the visual modules introduces new challenges in terms of robustness for LVLMs, as attackers can craft adversarial images that are visually clean but may mislead the model to generate incorrect answers. In general, LVLMs rely on vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial for the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.</description>

      <title>PII-Scope: A Benchmark for Training Data PII Leakage Assessment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PII-Scope, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies for PII extraction attacks targeting LLMs across diverse threat settings. Our study provides a deeper understanding of these attacks by uncovering several hyperparameters (e.g., demonstration selection) crucial to their effectiveness. Building on this understanding, we extend our study to more realistic attack scenarios, exploring PII attacks that employ advanced adversarial strategies, including repeated and diverse querying, and leveraging iterative learning for continual PII extraction. Through extensive experimentation, our results reveal a notable underestimation of PII leakage in existing single-query attacks. In fact, we show that with sophisticated adversarial capabilities and a limited query budget, PII extraction rates can increase by up to fivefold when targeting the pretrained model. Moreover, we evaluate PII leakage on finetuned models, showing that they are more vulnerable to leakage than pretrained models. Overall, our work establishes a rigorous empirical benchmark for PII extraction attacks in realistic threat scenarios and provides a strong foundation for developing effective mitigation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrating verbalized probabilities presents a novel approach for reliably assessing and leveraging outputs from black-box Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent methods have demonstrated improved calibration by applying techniques like Platt scaling or temperature scaling to the confidence scores generated by LLMs. In this paper, we explore the calibration of verbalized probability distributions for discriminative tasks. First, we investigate the capability of LLMs to generate probability distributions over categorical labels. We theoretically and empirically identify the issue of re-softmax arising from the scaling of verbalized probabilities, and propose using the invert softmax trick to approximate the "logit" by inverting verbalized probabilities. Through extensive evaluation on three public datasets, we demonstrate: (1) the robust capability of LLMs in generating class distributions, and (2) the effectiveness of the invert softmax trick in estimating logits, which, in turn, facilitates post-calibration adjustments.</description>

      <title>Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features. Our code is available at https://github.com/Darkbblue/diffusion-content-shift.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Point Cloud Colorization on Semantic Segmentation Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud semantic segmentation, the process of classifying each point into predefined categories, is essential for 3D scene understanding. While image-based segmentation is widely adopted due to its maturity, methods relying solely on RGB information often suffer from degraded performance due to color inaccuracies. Recent advancements have incorporated additional features such as intensity and geometric information, yet RGB channels continue to negatively impact segmentation accuracy when errors in colorization occur. Despite this, previous studies have not rigorously quantified the effects of erroneous colorization on segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical approach to evaluate the impact of inaccurate RGB information on image-based point cloud segmentation. We categorize RGB inaccuracies into two types: incorrect color information and similar color information. Our results demonstrate that both types of color inaccuracies significantly degrade segmentation accuracy, with similar color errors particularly affecting the extraction of geometric features. These findings highlight the critical need to reassess the role of RGB information in point cloud segmentation and its implications for future algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Weak-eval-Strong: Evaluating and Eliciting Lateral Thinking of LLMs with Situation Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While advancements in NLP have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring vertical thinking, their lateral thinking capabilities remain under-explored and challenging to measure due to the complexity of assessing creative thought processes and the scarcity of relevant data. To address these challenges, we introduce SPLAT, a benchmark leveraging Situation Puzzles to evaluate and elicit LAteral Thinking of LLMs. This benchmark, containing 975 graded situation puzzles across three difficulty levels, employs a new multi-turn player-judge framework instead of the traditional model-based evaluation, which often necessitates a stronger evaluation model. This framework simulates an interactive game where the model (player) asks the evaluation model (judge) questions about an incomplete story to infer the full scenario. The judge answers based on a detailed reference scenario or evaluates if the player's predictions align with the reference one. This approach lessens dependence on more robust evaluation models, enabling the assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. The experiments demonstrate that a robust evaluation model, such as WizardLM-2, closely matches human judgements in both intermediate question-answering and final scenario accuracy, achieving over 80% agreement-similar to the agreement levels among humans. Furthermore, applying data and reasoning processes from our benchmark to other lateral thinking-related benchmarks, e.g., RiddleSense and BrainTeaser, leads to performance enhancements. This suggests that our benchmark effectively evaluates and elicits the lateral thinking abilities of LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/chenqi008/LateralThinking.</description>

      <title>Which Programming Language and What Features at Pre-training Stage Affect Downstream Logical Inference Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities in mathematics and logical reasoning tasks. Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Diffuse or Confuse: A Diffusion Deepfake Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have significantly improved synthetic speech generation. This paper explores diffusion models, a novel method for creating realistic synthetic speech. We create a diffusion dataset using available tools and pretrained models. Additionally, this study assesses the quality of diffusion-generated deepfakes versus non-diffusion ones and their potential threat to current deepfake detection systems. Findings indicate that the detection of diffusion-based deepfakes is generally comparable to non-diffusion deepfakes, with some variability based on detector architecture. Re-vocoding with diffusion vocoders shows minimal impact, and the overall speech quality is comparable to non-diffusion methods.</description>

      <title>Defending Membership Inference Attacks via Privacy-aware Sparsity Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-parameterized models are typically vulnerable to membership inference attacks, which aim to determine whether a specific sample is included in the training of a given model. Previous Weight regularizations (e.g., L1 regularization) typically impose uniform penalties on all parameters, leading to a suboptimal tradeoff between model utility and privacy. In this work, we first show that only a small fraction of parameters substantially impact the privacy risk. In light of this, we propose Privacy-aware Sparsity Tuning (PAST), a simple fix to the L1 Regularization, by employing adaptive penalties to different parameters. Our key idea behind PAST is to promote sparsity in parameters that significantly contribute to privacy leakage. In particular, we construct the adaptive weight for each parameter based on its privacy sensitivity, i.e., the gradient of the loss gap with respect to the parameter. Using PAST, the network shrinks the loss gap between members and non-members, leading to strong resistance to privacy attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAST, achieving a state-of-the-art balance in the privacy-utility trade-off.</description>

      <title>Multi-Neuron Unleashes Expressivity of ReLU Networks Under Convex Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural work certification has established itself as a crucial tool for ensuring the robustness of neural networks. Certification methods typically rely on convex relaxations of the feasible output set to provide sound bounds. However, complete certification requires exact bounds, which strongly limits the expressivity of ReLU networks: even for the simple ``$\max$'' function in $\mathbb{R}^2$, there does not exist a ReLU network that expresses this function and can be exactly bounded by single-neuron relaxation methods. This raises the question whether there exists a convex relaxation that can provide exact bounds for general continuous piecewise linear functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by showing that (layer-wise) multi-neuron relaxation provides complete certification for general ReLU networks. Based on this novel result, we show that the expressivity of ReLU networks is no longer limited under multi-neuron relaxation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first positive result on the completeness of convex relaxations, shedding light on the practice of certified robustness.</description>

      <title>An Improved Approach for Cardiac MRI Segmentation based on 3D UNet Combined with Papillary Muscle Exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most important clinical parameter of cardiovascular function. The accuracy in estimating this parameter is highly dependent upon the precise segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) structure at the end diastole and systole phases. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust algorithms for the precise segmentation of the heart structure during different phases. Methodology: In this work, an improved 3D UNet model is introduced to segment the myocardium and LV, while excluding papillary muscles, as per the recommendation of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. For the practical testing of the proposed framework, a total of 8,400 cardiac MRI images were collected and analysed from the military hospital in Tunis (HMPIT), as well as the popular ACDC public dataset. As performance metrics, we used the Dice coefficient and the F1 score for validation/testing of the LV and the myocardium segmentation. Results: The data was split into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. It is worth noting that the proposed segmentation model was tested across three axis views: basal, medio basal and apical at two different cardiac phases: end diastole and end systole instances. The experimental results showed a Dice index of 0.965 and 0.945, and an F1 score of 0.801 and 0.799, at the end diastolic and systolic phases, respectively. Additionally, clinical evaluation outcomes revealed a significant difference in the LVEF and other clinical parameters when the papillary muscles were included or excluded.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Neural Potential Field: Online Trajectory Optimization in Presence of Moving Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a task of local trajectory planning for the mobile robot in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

      <title>MentalArena: Self-play Training of Language Models for Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Health Disorders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health disorders are one of the most serious diseases in the world. Most people with such a disease lack access to adequate care, which highlights the importance of training models for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. However, in the mental health domain, privacy concerns limit the accessibility of personalized treatment data, making it challenging to build powerful models. In this paper, we introduce MentalArena, a self-play framework to train language models by generating domain-specific personalized data, where we obtain a better model capable of making a personalized diagnosis and treatment (as a therapist) and providing information (as a patient). To accurately model human-like mental health patients, we devise Symptom Encoder, which simulates a real patient from both cognition and behavior perspectives. To address intent bias during patient-therapist interactions, we propose Symptom Decoder to compare diagnosed symptoms with encoded symptoms, and dynamically manage the dialogue between patient and therapist according to the identified deviations. We evaluated MentalArena against 6 benchmarks, including biomedicalQA and mental health tasks, compared to 6 advanced models. Our models, fine-tuned on both GPT-3.5 and Llama-3-8b, significantly outperform their counterparts, including GPT-4o. We hope that our work can inspire future research on personalized care.

      <title>Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Ensemble in Transferable Adversarial Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model ensemble adversarial attack has become a powerful method for generating transferable adversarial examples that can target even unknown models, but its theoretical foundation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we provide early theoretical insights that serve as a roadmap for advancing model ensemble adversarial attack. We first define transferability error to measure the error in adversarial transferability, alongside concepts of diversity and empirical model ensemble Rademacher complexity. We then decompose the transferability error into vulnerability, diversity, and a constant, which rigidly explains the origin of transferability error in model ensemble attack: the vulnerability of an adversarial example to ensemble components, and the diversity of ensemble components. Furthermore, we apply the latest mathematical tools in information theory to bound the transferability error using complexity and generalization terms, contributing to three practical guidelines for reducing transferability error: (1) incorporating more surrogate models, (2) increasing their diversity, and (3) reducing their complexity in cases of overfitting. Finally, extensive experiments with 54 models validate our theoretical framework, representing a significant step forward in understanding transferable model ensemble adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Students' Perceptions and Use of Generative AI Tools for Programming Across Different Computing Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigation of students' perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking.
  In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly.
  We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall `23, winter `23, and spring `24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time.
  We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.</description>

      <title>Degree Distribution based Spiking Graph Networks for Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant attraction from both researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are only effective for in-distribution data and cannot tackle out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-aware Spiking Graph Domain Adaptation for Classification. The proposed DeSGDA addresses the spiking graph domain adaptation problem by three aspects: node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. First, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method for generating degree-dependent spiking signals. Specifically, the threshold of triggering a spike is determined by the node degree, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator. Such an alignment module can efficiently maintain high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed DeSGDA compared with competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Combining Planning and Diffusion for Mobility with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of large objects over long horizons (such as carts in a warehouse) is an essential skill for deployable robotic systems. Large objects require mobile manipulation which involves simultaneous manipulation, navigation, and movement with the object in tow. In many real-world situations, object dynamics are incredibly complex, such as the interaction of an office chair (with a rotating base and five caster wheels) and the ground. We present a hierarchical algorithm for long-horizon robot manipulation problems in which the dynamics are partially unknown. We observe that diffusion-based behavior cloning is highly effective for short-horizon problems with unknown dynamics, so we decompose the problem into an abstract high-level, obstacle-aware motion-planning problem that produces a waypoint sequence. We use a short-horizon, relative-motion diffusion policy to achieve the waypoints in sequence. We train mobile manipulation policies on a Spot robot that has to push and pull an office chair. Our hierarchical manipulation policy performs consistently better, especially when the horizon increases, compared to a diffusion policy trained on long-horizon demonstrations or motion planning assuming a rigidly-attached object (success rate of 8 (versus 0 and 5 respectively) out of 10 runs). Importantly, our learned policy generalizes to new layouts, grasps, chairs, and flooring that induces more friction, without any further training, showing promise for other complex mobile manipulation problems.

      <title>Compositional Entailment Learning for Hyperbolic Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text representation learning forms a cornerstone in vision-language models, where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively aligned in a shared embedding space. Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose LLM agents as a novel approach in behavioral strategy research, complementing simulations and laboratory experiments to advance our understanding of cognitive processes in decision-making. Specifically, we reproduce a human laboratory experiment in behavioral strategy using large language model (LLM) generated agents and investigate how LLM agents compare to observed human behavior. Our results show that LLM agents effectively reproduce search behavior and decision-making comparable to humans. Extending our experiment, we analyze LLM agents' simulated "thoughts," discovering that more forward-looking thoughts correlate with favoring exploitation over exploration to maximize wealth. We show how this new approach can be leveraged in behavioral strategy research and address limitations.</description>

      <title>AutoFeedback: An LLM-based Framework for Efficient and Accurate API Request Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage external tools primarily through generating the API request to enhance task completion efficiency. The accuracy of API request generation significantly determines the capability of LLMs to accomplish tasks.
  Due to the inherent hallucinations within the LLM, it is difficult to efficiently and accurately generate the correct API request.
  Current research uses prompt-based feedback to facilitate the LLM-based API request generation. However, existing methods lack factual information and are insufficiently detailed.
  To address these issues, we propose AutoFeedback, an LLM-based framework for efficient and accurate API request generation, with a Static Scanning Component (SSC) and a Dynamic Analysis Component (DAC). SSC incorporates errors detected in the API requests as pseudo-facts into the feedback, enriching the factual information. DAC retrieves information from API documentation, enhancing the level of detail in feedback.
  Based on this two components, Autofeedback implementes two feedback loops during the process of generating API requests by the LLM.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly improves accuracy of API request generation and reduces the interaction cost. AutoFeedback achieves an accuracy of 100.00\% on a real-world API dataset and reduces the cost of interaction with GPT-3.5 Turbo by 23.44\%, and GPT-4 Turbo by 11.85\%.</description>

      <title>Faithful Interpretation for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, attention mechanisms have garnered increasing attention in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Transformers (GTs). It is not only due to the commendable boost in performance they offer but also its capacity to provide a more lucid rationale for model behaviors, which are often viewed as inscrutable. However, Attention-based GNNs have demonstrated instability in interpretability when subjected to various sources of perturbations during both training and testing phases, including factors like additional edges or nodes. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph Attention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial properties regarding stability and sensitivity to interpretation and final output distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient methodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification to the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we introduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and preserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of perturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable explanation tool.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM): Enhancing Classification Performance with AdaBoost and Residual Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional boosting algorithms, the focus on misclassified training samples emphasizes their importance based on difficulty during the learning process. While using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a weak learner in an AdaBoost framework can enhance model performance by concentrating on error samples, this approach introduces significant challenges. Specifically, SVMs, characterized by their stability and robustness, may require destabilization to fit the boosting paradigm, which in turn can constrain performance due to reliance on the weighted results from preceding iterations. To address these challenges, we propose the Support Vector Boosting Machine (SVBM), which integrates a novel subsampling process with SVM algorithms and residual connection techniques. This method updates sample weights by considering both the current model's predictions and the outputs from prior rounds, allowing for effective sparsity control. The SVBM framework enhances the ability to form complex decision boundaries, thereby improving classification performance. The MATLAB source code for SVBM can be accessed at https://github.com/junbolian/SVBM.</description>

      <title>Self-Boosting Large Language Models with Synthetic Preference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through alignment with human preferences, Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in generating honest, harmless, and helpful responses. However, collecting high-quality preference data is a resource-intensive and creativity-demanding process, especially for the continual improvement of LLMs. We introduce SynPO, a self-boosting paradigm that leverages synthetic preference data for model alignment. SynPO employs an iterative mechanism wherein a self-prompt generator creates diverse prompts, and a response improver refines model responses progressively. This approach trains LLMs to autonomously learn the generative rewards for their own outputs and eliminates the need for large-scale annotation of prompts and human preferences. After four SynPO iterations, Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B show significant enhancements in instruction-following abilities, achieving over 22.1% win rate improvements on AlpacaEval 2.0 and ArenaHard. Simultaneously, SynPO improves the general performance of LLMs on various tasks, validated by a 3.2 to 5.0 average score increase on the well-recognized Open LLM leaderboard.</description>

      <title>ELMO: Enhanced Real-time LiDAR Motion Capture through Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research. The dataset and evaluation code are available at {\blue \url{https://movin3d.github.io/ELMO_SIGASIA2024/}}</description>

      <title>Uncovering Factor Level Preferences to Improve Human-Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment, understanding the reasons behind LLM preferences remains crucial for bridging the gap between desired and actual behavior. LLMs often exhibit biases or tendencies that diverge from human preferences, such as favoring certain writing styles or producing overly verbose outputs. However, current methods for evaluating preference alignment often lack explainability, relying on coarse-grained comparisons. To address this, we introduce PROFILE (PRObing Factors of InfLuence for Explainability), a novel framework that uncovers and quantifies the influence of specific factors driving preferences. PROFILE's factor level analysis explains the 'why' behind human-model alignment and misalignment, offering insights into the direction of model improvement. We apply PROFILE to analyze human and LLM preferences across three tasks: summarization, helpful response generation, and document-based question-answering. Our factor level analysis reveals a substantial discrepancy between human and LLM preferences in generation tasks, whereas LLMs show strong alignment with human preferences in evaluation tasks. We demonstrate how leveraging factor level insights, including addressing misaligned factors or exploiting the generation-evaluation gap, can improve alignment with human preferences. This work underscores the importance of explainable preference analysis and highlights PROFILE's potential to provide valuable training signals, driving further improvements in human-model alignment.</description>

      <title>DLGNet: Hyperedge Classification through Directed Line Graphs for Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs and hypergraphs provide powerful abstractions for modeling interactions among a set of entities of interest and have been attracting a growing interest in the literature thanks to many successful applications in several fields. In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as chemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule generation. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical reactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed hyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction classification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph (DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG transformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the Directed Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of the interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph thanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many desirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being positive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a spectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction datasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing approaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average relative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum improvement of 37.71%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contexts with limited computational and data resources, high-resource language models often prove inadequate, particularly when addressing the specific needs of Malay languages. This paper introduces a Personal Intelligence System designed to efficiently integrate both on-device and server-based models. The system incorporates SLiM-34M for on-device processing, optimized for low memory and power usage, and MANYAK-1.3B for server-based tasks, allowing for scalable, high-performance language processing. The models achieve significant results across various tasks, such as machine translation, question-answering, and translate IndoMMLU. Particularly noteworthy is SLiM-34M's ability to achieve a high improvement in accuracy compared to other LLMs while using 2 times fewer pre-training tokens. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that large-scale computational resources are necessary to build effective language models, contributing to the development of resource-efficient models for the Malay language with the unique orchestration between SLiM-34M and MANYAK-1.3B.</description>

      <title>Adaptive High-Frequency Transformer for Diverse Wildlife Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildlife ReID involves utilizing visual technology to identify specific individuals of wild animals in different scenarios, holding significant importance for wildlife conservation, ecological research, and environmental monitoring. Existing wildlife ReID methods are predominantly tailored to specific species, exhibiting limited applicability. Although some approaches leverage extensively studied person ReID techniques, they struggle to address the unique challenges posed by wildlife. Therefore, in this paper, we present a unified, multi-species general framework for wildlife ReID. Given that high-frequency information is a consistent representation of unique features in various species, significantly aiding in identifying contours and details such as fur textures, we propose the Adaptive High-Frequency Transformer model with the goal of enhancing high-frequency information learning. To mitigate the inevitable high-frequency interference in the wilderness environment, we introduce an object-aware high-frequency selection strategy to adaptively capture more valuable high-frequency components. Notably, we unify the experimental settings of multiple wildlife datasets for ReID, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art ReID methods. In domain generalization scenarios, our approach demonstrates robust generalization to unknown species.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Universal Feature Spaces Across Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones. This makes it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics like Singular Value Canonical Correlation Analysis to analyze these SAE features across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</description>

Abstract: Large language models have been successfully applied to programming assistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional code editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

Abstract: The patent domain is gaining attention in natural language processing research, offering practical applications in streamlining the patenting process and providing challenging benchmarks for large language models (LLMs). However, the generation of the description sections of patents, which constitute more than 90% of the patent document, has not been studied to date. We address this gap by introducing the task of outline-guided paper-to-patent generation, where an academic paper provides the technical specification of the invention and an outline conveys the desired patent structure. We present PAP2PAT, a new challenging benchmark of 1.8k patent-paper pairs with document outlines, collected using heuristics that reflect typical research lab practices. Our experiments with current open-weight LLMs and outline-guided chunk-based generation show that they can effectively use information from the paper but struggle with repetitions, likely due to the inherent repetitiveness of patent language. We release our data and code.</description>

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in machine learning is a burgeoning area of study. Its primary goal is to enhance the adaptability and resilience of machine learning models when faced with new, unseen, and potentially adversarial data that significantly diverges from their original training datasets. In this paper, we investigate time series OOD generalization via pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We first propose a novel \textbf{T}ri-level learning framework for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{O}OD generalization, termed TTSO, which considers both sample-level and group-level uncertainties. This formula offers a fresh theoretic perspective for formulating and analyzing OOD generalization problem. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify this method is well motivated. We then develop a stratified localization algorithm tailored for this tri-level optimization problem, theoretically demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis also reveals that the iteration complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is bounded by O($\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>PositionID: LLMs can Control Lengths, Copy and Paste with Explicit Positional Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across various domains, including role-playing, creative writing, mathematical reasoning, and coding. Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter challenges with length control, frequently failing to adhere to specific length constraints due to their token-level operations and insufficient training on data with strict length limitations. We identify this issue as stemming from a lack of positional awareness and propose novel approaches--PositionID Prompting and PositionID Fine-Tuning--to address it. These methods enhance the model's ability to continuously monitor and manage text length during generation. Additionally, we introduce PositionID CP Prompting to enable LLMs to perform copy and paste operations accurately. Furthermore, we develop two benchmarks for evaluating length control and copy-paste abilities. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the model's adherence to length constraints and copy-paste accuracy without compromising response quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of transformers as a function of the number of repetitions of training examples with algorithmically generated datasets. On three problems of mathematics: the greatest common divisor, modular multiplication, and matrix eigenvalues, we show that for a fixed number of training steps, models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform models trained on larger sets of single-use examples. We also demonstrate that two-set training - repeated use of a small random subset of examples, along normal sampling on the rest of the training set - provides for faster learning and better performance. This highlights that the benefits of repetition can outweigh those of data diversity. These datasets and problems provide a controlled setting to shed light on the still poorly understood interplay between generalization and memorization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>ReIFE: Re-evaluating Instruction-Following Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automatic evaluation of instruction following typically involves using large language models (LLMs) to assess response quality. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of these LLM-based evaluators across two dimensions: the base LLMs and the evaluation protocols. Therefore, we present a thorough meta-evaluation of instruction following, including 25 base LLMs and 15 recently proposed evaluation protocols, on 4 human-annotated datasets, assessing the evaluation accuracy of the LLM-evaluators. Our evaluation allows us to identify the best-performing base LLMs and evaluation protocols with a high degree of robustness. Moreover, our large-scale evaluation reveals: (1) Base LLM performance ranking remains largely consistent across evaluation protocols, with less capable LLMs showing greater improvement from protocol enhancements; (2) Robust evaluation of evaluation protocols requires many base LLMs with varying capability levels, as protocol effectiveness can depend on the base LLM used; (3) Evaluation results on different datasets are not always consistent, so a rigorous evaluation requires multiple datasets with distinctive features. We release our meta-evaluation suite ReIFE, which provides the codebase and evaluation result collection for more than 500 LLM-evaluator configurations, to support future research in instruction-following evaluation.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Auto Generation of Labeling Functions for Software Engineering Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software engineering (SE) chatbots are increasingly gaining attention for their role in enhancing development processes. At the core of chatbots are the Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend and respond to user queries. Before deploying NLUs, there is a need to train them with labeled data. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This challenge arises because training SE chatbots requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, chatbot developers often resort to manually annotating user queries to gather the data necessary for training effective chatbots, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Previous studies propose approaches to support chatbot practitioners in annotating users' posed queries. However, these approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that identify and categorize user queries based on specific patterns in the data. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the queries of four diverse SE datasets (namely AskGit, MSA, Ask Ubuntu, and Stack Overflow) and measure the performance improvement gained from training the NLU on the queries labeled by the generated LFs. We find that the generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores of up to 85.3%, and NLU's performance improvement of up to 27.2% across the studied datasets. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs used to generate LFs affects the labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities.</description>

      <title>I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</description>

      <title>VHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: visual perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website (https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1). VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time.</description>

      <title>System 2 thinking in OpenAI's o1-preview model: Near-perfect performance on a mathematics exam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into two systems: System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the O1 model series, specifically designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the O1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 73 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 61 out of 76, well above the Dutch average of 40.63 points. The O1-preview model completed the exam in around 10 minutes, while GPT-4o took 3 minutes, and neither model had access to the exam figures. Although O1-preview had the ability to achieve a perfect score, its performance showed some variability, as it made occasional mistakes with repeated prompting. This suggests that the self-consistency method, where the consensus output is selected, could improve accuracy. We conclude that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</description>

      <title>Thing2Reality: Transforming 2D Content into Conditioned Multiviews and 3D Gaussian Objects for XR Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During remote communication, participants often share both digital and physical content, such as product designs, digital assets, and environments, to enhance mutual understanding. Recent advances in augmented communication have facilitated users to swiftly create and share digital 2D copies of physical objects from video feeds into a shared space. However, conventional 2D representations of digital objects restricts users' ability to spatially reference items in a shared immersive environment. To address this, we propose Thing2Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) communication platform that enhances spontaneous discussions of both digital and physical items during remote sessions. With Thing2Reality, users can quickly materialize ideas or physical objects in immersive environments and share them as conditioned multiview renderings or 3D Gaussians. Thing2Reality enables users to interact with remote objects or discuss concepts in a collaborative manner. Our user study revealed that the ability to interact with and manipulate 3D representations of objects significantly enhances the efficiency of discussions, with the potential to augment discussion of 2D artifacts.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for E-commerce Query Product Type Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Getting a good understanding of the customer intent is essential in e-commerce search engines. In particular, associating the correct product type to a search query plays a vital role in surfacing correct products to the customers. Query product type classification (Q2PT) is a particularly challenging task because search queries are short and ambiguous, the number of existing product categories is extremely large, spanning thousands of values. Moreover, international marketplaces face additional challenges, such as language and dialect diversity and cultural differences, influencing the interpretation of the query. In this work we focus on Q2PT prediction in the global multilocale e-commerce markets. The common approach of training Q2PT models for each locale separately shows significant performance drops in low-resource stores. Moreover, this method does not allow for a smooth expansion to a new country, requiring to collect the data and train a new locale-specific Q2PT model from scratch. To tackle this, we propose to use transfer learning from the highresource to the low-resource locales, to achieve global parity of Q2PT performance. We benchmark the per-locale Q2PT model against the unified one, which shares the training data and model structure across all worldwide stores. Additionally, we compare locale-aware and locale-agnostic Q2PT models, showing the task dependency on the country-specific traits. We conduct extensive quantiative and qualitative analysis of Q2PT models on the large-scale e-commerce dataset across 20 worldwide locales, which shows that unified locale-aware Q2PT model has superior performance over the alternatives.</description>

      <title>End-Cloud Collaboration Framework for Advanced AI Customer Service in E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the e-commerce industry has seen a rapid increase in the demand for advanced AI-driven customer service solutions. Traditional cloud-based models face limitations in terms of latency, personalized services, and privacy concerns. Furthermore, end devices often lack the computational resources to deploy large AI models effectively. In this paper, we propose an innovative End-Cloud Collaboration (ECC) framework for advanced AI customer service in e-commerce. This framework integrates the advantages of large cloud models and mid/small-sized end models by deeply exploring the generalization potential of cloud models and effectively utilizing the computing power resources of terminal chips, alleviating the strain on computing resources to some extent. Specifically, the large cloud model acts as a teacher, guiding and promoting the learning of the end model, which significantly reduces the end model's reliance on large-scale, high-quality data and thereby addresses the data bottleneck in traditional end model training, offering a new paradigm for the rapid deployment of industry applications. Additionally, we introduce an online evolutive learning strategy that enables the end model to continuously iterate and upgrade based on guidance from the cloud model and real-time user feedback. This strategy ensures that the model can flexibly adapt to the rapid changes in application scenarios while avoiding the uploading of sensitive information by performing local fine-tuning, achieving the dual goals of privacy protection and personalized service. %We make systematic contributions to the customized model fine-tuning methods in the e-commerce domain. To conclude, we implement in-depth corpus collection (e.g., data organization, cleaning, and preprocessing) and train an ECC-based industry-specific model for e-commerce customer service.</description>

      <title>Cross-Task Pretraining for Cross-Organ Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation</title>

Abstract: This short abstract describes a solution to the COSAS 2024 competition on Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation from histopathological image patches. The main challenge in the task of segmenting this type of cancer is a noticeable domain shift encountered when changing acquisition devices (microscopes) and also when tissue comes from different organs. The two tasks proposed in COSAS were to train on a dataset of images from three different organs, and then predict segmentations on data from unseen organs (dataset T1), and to train on a dataset of images acquired on three different scanners and then segment images acquired with another unseen microscope. We attempted to bridge the domain shift gap by experimenting with three different strategies: standard training for each dataset, pretraining on dataset T1 and then fine-tuning on dataset T2 (and vice-versa, a strategy we call \textit{Cross-Task Pretraining}), and training on the combination of dataset A and B. Our experiments showed that Cross-Task Pre-training is a more promising approach to domain generalization.</description>

Abstract: This paper compares the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, encoder-based models, and large language models (LLMs) on the task of detecting depression and anxiety. Five datasets were considered, each differing in format and the method used to define the target pathology class. We tested AutoML models based on linguistic features, several variations of encoder-based Transformers such as BERT, and state-of-the-art LLMs as pathology classification models. The results demonstrated that LLMs outperform traditional methods, particularly on noisy and small datasets where training examples vary significantly in text length and genre. However, psycholinguistic features and encoder-based models can achieve performance comparable to language models when trained on texts from individuals with clinically confirmed depression, highlighting their potential effectiveness in targeted clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Query Engine for Relational Databases using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing reliance on data-driven decision-making highlights the need for more intuitive ways to access and analyze information stored in relational databases. However, the requirement of SQL knowledge has long been a significant barrier for non-technical users. This article introduces an innovative solution that leverages Generative AI to bridge this gap, enabling users to query databases using natural language. Our approach automatically translates natural language queries into SQL, ensuring both syntactic and semantic correctness, while also generating clear, natural language responses from the retrieved data. By streamlining the interaction between users and databases, this method empowers individuals without technical expertise to engage with data directly and efficiently, democratizing access to valuable insights and enhancing productivity.</description>

      <title>Stuffed Mamba: State Collapse and State Capacity of RNN-Based Long-Context Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One essential advantage of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) over transformer-based language models is their linear computational complexity concerning the sequence length, which makes them much faster in handling long sequences during inference. However, most publicly available RNNs (e.g., Mamba and RWKV) are trained on sequences with less than 10K tokens, and their effectiveness in longer contexts remains largely unsatisfying so far. In this paper, we study the cause of the inability to process long context for RNNs and suggest critical mitigations. We examine two practical concerns when applying state-of-the-art RNNs to long contexts: (1) the inability to extrapolate to inputs longer than the training length and (2) the upper bound of memory capacity. Addressing the first concern, we first investigate *state collapse* (SC), a phenomenon that causes severe performance degradation on sequence lengths not encountered during training. With controlled experiments, we attribute this to overfitting due to the recurrent state being overparameterized for the training length. For the second concern, we train a series of Mamba-2 models on long documents to empirically estimate the recurrent state capacity in language modeling and passkey retrieval. Then, three SC mitigation methods are proposed to improve Mamba-2's length generalizability, allowing the model to process more than 1M tokens without SC. We also find that the recurrent state capacity in passkey retrieval scales exponentially to the state size, and we empirically train a Mamba-2 370M with near-perfect passkey retrieval accuracy on 256K context length. This suggests a promising future for RNN-based long-context modeling.</description>

      <title>Taking a turn for the better: Conversation redirection throughout the course of mental-health therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental-health therapy involves a complex conversation flow in which patients and therapists continuously negotiate what should be talked about next. For example, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the therapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the discussion towards issues they want to focus on.
  How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and quality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a probabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately redirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and the actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to characterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple sessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis reveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally increases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses; and (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are significantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their therapist and terminate the relationship.</description>

      <title>Graph Network Models To Detect Illicit Transactions In Block Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of cryptocurrencies has led to an increase in illicit activities such as money laundering, with traditional rule-based approaches becoming less effective in detecting and preventing such activities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackling this problem by applying graph attention networks with residual network-like architecture (GAT-ResNet) to detect illicit transactions related to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in blockchains. We train various models on the Elliptic Bitcoin Transaction dataset, implementing logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, GCN, GAT, and our proposed GAT-ResNet model. Our results demonstrate that the GAT-ResNet model has a potential to outperform the existing graph network models in terms of accuracy, reliability and scalability. Our research sheds light on the potential of graph related machine learning models to improve efforts to combat financial crime and lays the foundation for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Quanda: An Interpretability Toolkit for Training Data Attribution Evaluation and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, training data attribution (TDA) methods have emerged as a promising direction for the interpretability of neural networks. While research around TDA is thriving, limited effort has been dedicated to the evaluation of attributions. Similar to the development of evaluation metrics for traditional feature attribution approaches, several standalone metrics have been proposed to evaluate the quality of TDA methods across various contexts. However, the lack of a unified framework that allows for systematic comparison limits trust in TDA methods and stunts their widespread adoption. To address this research gap, we introduce Quanda, a Python toolkit designed to facilitate the evaluation of TDA methods. Beyond offering a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, Quanda provides a uniform interface for seamless integration with existing TDA implementations across different repositories, thus enabling systematic benchmarking. The toolkit is user-friendly, thoroughly tested, well-documented, and available as an open-source library on PyPi and under https://github.com/dilyabareeva/quanda.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.</description>

      <title>Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</description>

      <title>One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across model weights. Recent works focus on weight-driven initialization or learning of adaptive ranks during training. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and re-distribute ranks among all weight matrices to explain the maximal amount of variance and continue the standard LoRA fine-tuning procedure. This results in our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and attains the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain.</description>

      <title>Do better language models have crisper vision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How well do text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) grasp the visual world? As LLMs are increasingly used in computer vision, addressing this question becomes both fundamental and pertinent. However, existing studies have primarily focused on limited scenarios, such as their ability to generate visual content or cluster multimodal data. To this end, we propose the Visual Text Representation Benchmark (ViTeRB) to isolate key properties that make language models well-aligned with the visual world. With this, we identify large-scale decoder-based LLMs as ideal candidates for representing text in vision-centric contexts, counter to the current practice of utilizing text encoders. Building on these findings, we propose ShareLock, an ultra-lightweight CLIP-like model. By leveraging precomputable frozen features from strong vision and language models, ShareLock achieves an impressive 51% accuracy on ImageNet despite utilizing just 563k image-caption pairs. Moreover, training requires only 1 GPU hour (or 10 hours including the precomputation of features) - orders of magnitude less than prior methods. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Neural Circuit Architectural Priors for Quadruped Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches to quadruped locomotion commonly adopt generic policy architectures like fully connected MLPs. As such architectures contain few inductive biases, it is common in practice to incorporate priors in the form of rewards, training curricula, imitation data, or trajectory generators. In nature, animals are born with priors in the form of their nervous system's architecture, which has been shaped by evolution to confer innate ability and efficient learning. For instance, a horse can walk within hours of birth and can quickly improve with practice. Such architectural priors can also be useful in ANN architectures for AI. In this work, we explore the advantages of a biologically inspired ANN architecture for quadruped locomotion based on neural circuits in the limbs and spinal cord of mammals. Our architecture achieves good initial performance and comparable final performance to MLPs, while using less data and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture also exhibits better generalization to task variations, even admitting deployment on a physical robot without standard sim-to-real methods. This work shows that neural circuits can provide valuable architectural priors for locomotion and encourages future work in other sensorimotor skills.</description>

      <title>Astute RAG: Overcoming Imperfect Retrieval Augmentation and Knowledge Conflicts for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while effective in integrating external knowledge to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be undermined by imperfect retrieval, which may introduce irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Despite its importance, previous studies have rarely explored the behavior of RAG through joint analysis on how errors from imperfect retrieval attribute and propagate, and how potential conflicts arise between the LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. We find that imperfect retrieval augmentation might be inevitable and quite harmful, through controlled analysis under realistic conditions. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To render LLMs resilient to imperfect retrieval, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach that adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments using Gemini and Claude demonstrate that Astute RAG significantly outperforms previous robustness-enhanced RAG methods. Notably, Astute RAG is the only approach that matches or exceeds the performance of LLMs without RAG under worst-case scenarios. Further analysis reveals that Astute RAG effectively resolves knowledge conflicts, improving the reliability and trustworthiness of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>MM-Ego: Towards Building Egocentric Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we develop a data engine that efficiently generates 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long, based on human-annotated data. This is currently the largest egocentric QA dataset. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we successfully build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.</description>

      <title>Active Inference Tree Search in Large POMDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.</description>

      <title>Validation of the Practicability of Logical Assessment Formula for Evaluations with Inaccurate Ground-Truth Labels: An Application Study on Tumour Segmentation for Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logical assessment formula (LAF) is a new theory proposed for evaluations with inaccurate ground-truth labels (IAGTLs) to assess the predictive models for artificial intelligence applications. However, the practicability of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs has not yet been validated in real-world practice. In this paper, we applied LAF to two tasks of tumour segmentation for breast cancer (TSfBC) in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA) for evaluations with IAGTLs. Experimental results and analysis show that the LAF-based evaluations with IAGTLs were unable to confidently act like usual evaluations with accurate ground-truth labels on the one easier task of TSfBC while being able to reasonably act like usual evaluations with AGTLs on the other more difficult task of TSfBC. These results and analysis reflect the potential of LAF applied to MHWSIA for evaluations with IAGTLs. This paper presents the first practical validation of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs in a real-world application.</description>

      <title>GOOSE Algorithm: A Powerful Optimization Tool for Real-World Engineering Challenges and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes the GOOSE algorithm as a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on the goose's behavior during rest and foraging. The goose stands on one leg and keeps his balance to guard and protect other individuals in the flock. The GOOSE algorithm is benchmarked on 19 well-known benchmark test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly algorithm (DA), and fitness dependent optimizer (FDO). In addition, the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 modern benchmark functions, and the gained results are compared with three recent algorithms, such as the dragonfly algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and salp swarm algorithm (SSA). Moreover, the GOOSE algorithm is tested on 5 classical benchmark functions, and the obtained results are evaluated with six algorithms, such as fitness dependent optimizer (FDO), FOX optimizer, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), whale optimization algorithm, dragonfly algorithm, and chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA). The achieved findings attest to the proposed algorithm's superior performance compared to the other algorithms that were utilized in the current study. The technique is then used to optimize Welded beam design and Economic Load Dispatch Problem, three renowned real-world engineering challenges, and the Pathological IgG Fraction in the Nervous System. The outcomes of the engineering case studies illustrate how well the suggested approach can optimize issues that arise in the real-world.</description>

      <title>Predictable Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the fundamental ideas and challenges of Predictable AI, a nascent research area that explores the ways in which we can anticipate key validity indicators (e.g., performance, safety) of present and future AI ecosystems. We argue that achieving predictability is crucial for fostering trust, liability, control, alignment and safety of AI ecosystems, and thus should be prioritised over performance. We formally characterise predictability, explore its most relevant components, illustrate what can be predicted, describe alternative candidates for predictors, as well as the trade-offs between maximising validity and predictability. To illustrate these concepts, we bring an array of illustrative examples covering diverse ecosystem configurations. Predictable AI is related to other areas of technical and non-technical AI research, but have distinctive questions, hypotheses, techniques and challenges. This paper aims to elucidate them, calls for identifying paths towards a landscape of predictably valid AI systems and outlines the potential impact of this emergent field.</description>

      <title>The Animal-AI Environment: A Virtual Laboratory For Comparative Cognition and Artificial Intelligence Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Animal-AI Environment is a unique game-based research platform designed to facilitate collaboration between the artificial intelligence and comparative cognition research communities. In this paper, we present the latest version of the Animal-AI Environment, outlining several major new features that make the game more engaging for humans and more complex for AI systems. New features include interactive buttons, reward dispensers, and player notifications, as well as an overhaul of the environment's graphics and processing for significant improvements in agent training time and quality of the human player experience. We provide detailed guidance on how to build computational and behavioural experiments with the Animal-AI Environment. We present results from a series of agents, including the state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning agent, Dreamer-v3, on newly designed tests and the Animal-AI Testbed of 900 tasks inspired by research in the field of comparative cognition. The Animal-AI Environment offers a new approach for modelling cognition in humans and non-human animals, and for building biologically-inspired artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Road Graph Generator: Mapping roads at construction sites from GPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for inferring roads from GPS trajectories to map construction sites. This task presents a unique challenge due to the erratic and non-standard movement patterns of construction machinery, which significantly diverge from typical vehicular traffic on established roads. Our proposed method first identifies intersections in the road network that serve as critical decision points, and then connects them with edges to produce a graph, which can subsequently be used for planning and task-allocation. We demonstrate the approach by mapping roads at a real-life construction site in Norway. The method is validated on four increasingly complex segments of the map. In our tests, the method achieved perfect accuracy in detecting intersections and inferring roads in data with no or low noise, while its performance was reduced in areas with significant noise and consistently missing GPS updates.</description>

      <title>The collective use and perceptions of generative AI tools in digital humanities research: Survey-based results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence technologies have revolutionized the research landscape, with significant implications for Digital Humanities, a field inherently intertwined with technological progress. This article investigates how DH scholars adopt and critically evaluate generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT in research. Drawing on 76 responses collected from an international survey study, we explored DH scholars' rationale for adopting or not adopting generative AI tools in research, identified the specific practices of using generative AI tools to support various DH research tasks, and analyzed scholars' collective perceptions regarding the benefits, risks, and challenges of using generative AI tools in DH research. The survey results reveal two key findings: first, DH research communities hold divisive opinions about the value of generative AI in DH scholarship; second, scholars have developed new practices and perceptions for using generative AI tools, which differ from those associated with traditional AI-based tools. Our survey represents one of the first survey-based analyses on this topic. It has the potential to serve as a building block for future empirical inquiries into the impact of generative AI on DH scholarship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the multi-dimensionality of game scenario diversity, spotlighting the innovative use of procedural content generation and other fields as cornerstones for enriching player experiences through diverse game scenarios. By traversing a wide array of disciplines, from affective modeling and multi-agent systems to psychological studies, our research underscores the importance of diverse game scenarios in gameplay and education. Through a taxonomy of diversity metrics and evaluation methods, we aim to bridge the current gaps in literature and practice, offering insights into effective strategies for measuring and integrating diversity in game scenarios. Our analysis highlights the necessity for a unified taxonomy to aid developers and researchers in crafting more engaging and varied game worlds. This survey not only charts a path for future research in diverse game scenarios but also serves as a handbook for industry practitioners seeking to leverage diversity as a key component of game design and development.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Vision-Language Models as Decision-Making Agents via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) fine-tuned on specialized visual instruction-following data have exhibited impressive language reasoning capabilities across various scenarios. However, this fine-tuning paradigm may not be able to efficiently learn optimal decision-making agents in multi-step goal-directed tasks from interactive environments. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini. Furthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance improvement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in the overall performance of our method.</description>

      <title>OMNI-EPIC: Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness with Environments Programmed in Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-ended and AI-generating algorithms aim to continuously generate and solve increasingly complex tasks indefinitely, offering a promising path toward more general intelligence. To accomplish this grand vision, learning must occur within a vast array of potential tasks. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments are constrained within manually predefined, often narrow distributions of environment, limiting their ability to create any learning environment. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework, OMNI-EPIC, that augments previous work in Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI) with Environments Programmed in Code (EPIC). OMNI-EPIC leverages foundation models to autonomously generate code specifying the next learnable (i.e., not too easy or difficult for the agent's current skill set) and interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel) tasks. OMNI-EPIC generates both environments (e.g., an obstacle course) and reward functions (e.g., progress through the obstacle course quickly without touching red objects), enabling it, in principle, to create any simulatable learning task. We showcase the explosive creativity of OMNI-EPIC, which continuously innovates to suggest new, interesting learning challenges. We also highlight how OMNI-EPIC can adapt to reinforcement learning agents' learning progress, generating tasks that are of suitable difficulty. Overall, OMNI-EPIC can endlessly create learnable and interesting environments, further propelling the development of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms.

      <title>DISCOVERYWORLD: A Virtual Environment for Developing and Evaluating Automated Scientific Discovery Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated scientific discovery promises to accelerate progress across scientific domains. However, developing and evaluating an AI agent's capacity for end-to-end scientific reasoning is challenging as running real-world experiments is often prohibitively expensive or infeasible. In this work we introduce DISCOVERYWORLD, the first virtual environment for developing and benchmarking an agent's ability to perform complete cycles of novel scientific discovery. DISCOVERYWORLD contains a variety of different challenges, covering topics as diverse as radioisotope dating, rocket science, and proteomics, to encourage development of general discovery skills rather than task-specific solutions. DISCOVERYWORLD itself is an inexpensive, simulated, text-based environment (with optional 2D visual overlay). It includes 120 different challenge tasks, spanning eight topics each with three levels of difficulty and several parametric variations. Each task requires an agent to form hypotheses, design and run experiments, analyze results, and act on conclusions. DISCOVERYWORLD further provides three automatic metrics for evaluating performance, based on (a) task completion, (b) task-relevant actions taken, and (c) the discovered explanatory knowledge. We find that strong baseline agents, that perform well in prior published environments, struggle on most DISCOVERYWORLD tasks, suggesting that DISCOVERYWORLD captures some of the novel challenges of discovery, and thus that DISCOVERYWORLD may help accelerate near-term development and assessment of scientific discovery competency in agents.

      <title>A Notion of Complexity for Theory of Mind via Discrete World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) can be used to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios where social reasoning is required. While the research community has proposed many ToM benchmarks, their hardness varies greatly, and their complexity is not well defined. This work proposes a framework inspired by cognitive load theory to measure the complexity of ToM tasks. We quantify a problem's complexity as the number of states necessary to solve it correctly. Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents' interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks.</description>

      <title>RouteFinder: Towards Foundation Models for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces RouteFinder, a comprehensive foundation model framework to tackle different Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any attribute combination. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 24 VRP variants show RouteFinder achieves competitive results. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/ai4co/routefinder.</description>

      <title>DISCO: Efficient Diffusion Solver for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems are fundamentally important in numerous real-world applications across diverse industries, characterized by entailing enormous solution space and demanding time-sensitive response. Despite recent advancements in neural solvers, their limited expressiveness struggles to capture the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has shifted towards diffusion models, these models still sample solutions indiscriminately from the entire NP-complete solution space with time-consuming denoising processes, which limit their practicality for large problem scales. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for large-scale Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is twofold: First, it enhances solution quality by constraining the sampling space to a more meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while preserving the multi-modal properties of the output distributions. Second, it accelerates the denoising process through an analytically solvable approach, enabling solution sampling with minimal reverse-time steps and significantly reducing inference time. DISCO delivers strong performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with inference time up to 5.28 times faster than other diffusion alternatives. By incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can well generalize to solve unseen-scale problem instances, even surpassing models specifically trained for those scales.</description>

Abstract: The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart home environments enables several applications in the areas of energy management, safety, well-being, and healthcare. ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained. Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.</description>

      <title>Images Speak Louder than Words: Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Vision-Language Model from a Causal Mediation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.</description>

      <title>MINDECHO: Role-Playing Language Agents for Key Opinion Leaders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various applications, among which role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have engaged a broad user base. Now, there is a growing demand for RPLAs that represent Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), \ie, Internet celebrities who shape the trends and opinions in their domains. However, research in this line remains underexplored. In this paper, we hence introduce MINDECHO, a comprehensive framework for the development and evaluation of KOL RPLAs. MINDECHO collects KOL data from Internet video transcripts in various professional fields, and synthesizes their conversations leveraging GPT-4. Then, the conversations and the transcripts are used for individualized model training and inference-time retrieval, respectively. Our evaluation covers both general dimensions (\ie, knowledge and tones) and fan-centric dimensions for KOLs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MINDECHO in developing and evaluating KOL RPLAs.</description>

      <title>SBoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Regional Weight Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Standard Basis LoRA (SBoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for Large Language Models that builds upon the pioneering works of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Orthogonal Adaptation. SBoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by half or doubles the rank with the similar number of trainable parameters as LoRA, while improving learning performance. By utilizing orthogonal standard basis vectors to initialize one of the low-rank matrices (either $\mathbf{A}$ or $\mathbf{B}$), SBoRA facilitates regional weight updates and memory-efficient fine-tuning. This results in two variants, SBoRA-FA and SBoRA-FB, where only one of the matrices is updated, leading to a sparse update matrix $\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W}$ with predominantly zero rows or columns. Consequently, most of the fine-tuned model's weights $(\mathbf{W}_0+\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W})$ remain unchanged from the pre-trained weights, akin to the modular organization of the human brain, which efficiently adapts to new tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SBoRA-FA over LoRA in various fine-tuning tasks, including commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of QSBoRA on quantized LLaMA models of varying scales, highlighting its potential for efficient adaptation to new tasks.

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</description>

Abstract: We present TRACE-cs, a novel hybrid system that combines symbolic reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to address contrastive queries in scheduling problems. TRACE-cs leverages SAT solving techniques to encode scheduling constraints and generate explanations for user queries, while utilizing an LLM to process the user queries into logical clauses as well as refine the explanations generated by the symbolic solver to natural language sentences. By integrating these components, our approach demonstrates the potential of combining symbolic methods with LLMs to create explainable AI agents with correctness guarantees.</description>

      <title>FineMolTex: Towards Fine-grained Molecular Graph-Text Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding molecular structure and related knowledge is crucial for scientific research. Recent studies integrate molecular graphs with their textual descriptions to enhance molecular representation learning. However, they focus on the whole molecular graph and neglect frequently occurring subgraphs, known as motifs,which are essential for determining molecular properties. Without such fine-grained knowledge, these models struggle to generalize to unseen molecules and tasks that require motif-level insights. To bridge this gap, we propose FineMolTex, a novel Fine-grained Molecular graph-Text pre-training framework to jointly learn coarse-grained molecule-level knowledge and fine-grained motif-level knowledge. Specifically, FineMolTex consists of two pre-training tasks: a contrastive alignment task for coarse-grained matching and a masked multi-modal modeling task for fine-grained matching. In particular, the latter predicts the labels of masked motifs and words, leveraging insights from each other, thereby enabling FineMolTex to understand the fine-grained matching between motifs and words. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across three downstream tasks, achieving up to 230% improvement in the text-based molecule editing task. Additionally, our case studies reveal that FineMolTex successfully captures fine-grained knowledge, potentially offering valuable insights for drug discovery and catalyst design.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of Huawei Translation Services Center (HW-TSC) to machine translation tasks of the 20th China Conference on Machine Translation (CCMT 2024). We participate in the bilingual machine translation task and multi-domain machine translation task. For these two translation tasks, we use training strategies such as regularized dropout, bidirectional training, data diversification, forward translation, back translation, alternated training, curriculum learning, and transductive ensemble learning to train neural machine translation (NMT) models based on the deep Transformer-big architecture. Furthermore, to explore whether large language model (LLM) can help improve the translation quality of NMT systems, we use supervised fine-tuning to train llama2-13b as an Automatic post-editing (APE) model to improve the translation results of the NMT model on the multi-domain machine translation task. By using these plyometric strategies, our submission achieves a competitive result in the final evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in processing text data, which has sparked interest in applying these models beyond textual data, such as graphs. In the field of graph learning, there is a growing interest in harnessing LLMs to comprehend and manipulate graph-structured data. Existing research predominantly focuses on graphs with rich textual features, such as knowledge graphs or text attribute graphs, leveraging LLMs' ability to process text but inadequately addressing graph structure. This work specifically aims to assess and enhance LLMs' abilities to comprehend and utilize the structural knowledge inherent in graph data itself, rather than focusing solely on graphs rich in textual content. To achieve this, we introduce the \textbf{G}raph \textbf{U}nderstanding for \textbf{N}atural Language \textbf{D}riven \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}odel (\model). This model adapts LLMs to better understand and engage with the structure of graph data, enabling them to perform complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the graph's structure itself. Our experimental evaluations on graph reasoning benchmarks not only substantiate that \model~ outperforms the SOTA baselines for comparisons. But also reveals key factors affecting the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis illustrating how reasoning paths can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Gamified Adversarial Prompting (GAP), a framework that crowd-sources high-quality data for visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models. GAP transforms the data collection process into an engaging game, incentivizing players to provide fine-grained, challenging questions and answers that target gaps in the model's knowledge. Our contributions include (1) an approach to capture question-answer pairs from humans that directly address weaknesses in a model's knowledge, (2) a method for evaluating and rewarding players that successfully incentivizes them to provide high-quality submissions, and (3) a scalable, gamified platform that succeeds in collecting this data from over 50,000 participants in just a few weeks. Our implementation of GAP has significantly improved the accuracy of a small multimodal model, namely MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B, increasing its GPT score from 0.147 to 0.477 on our dataset, approaching the benchmark set by the much larger GPT-4V. Moreover, we demonstrate that the data generated using MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B also enhances its performance across other benchmarks, and exhibits cross-model benefits. Specifically, the same data improves the performance of QWEN2-VL-2B and QWEN2-VL-7B on the same multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems have found applications across diverse domains such as recommender systems, healthcare, and finance. Traditional MAB algorithms typically assume stationary reward distributions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios characterized by non-stationary dynamics. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing and evaluating novel Bandit algorithms designed for non-stationary environments. First, we present the Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling (ADTS) algorithm, which enhances adaptability through relaxed discounting and sliding window mechanisms to better respond to changes in reward distributions. We then extend this approach to the Portfolio Optimization problem by introducing the Combinatorial Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling (CADTS) algorithm, which addresses computational challenges within Combinatorial Bandits and improves dynamic asset allocation. Additionally, we propose a novel architecture called Bandit Networks, which integrates the outputs of ADTS and CADTS, thereby mitigating computational limitations in stock selection. Through extensive experiments using real financial market data, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms and architectures in adapting to dynamic environments and optimizing decision-making processes. For instance, the proposed bandit network instances present superior performance when compared to classic portfolio optimization approaches, such as capital asset pricing model, equal weights, risk parity, and Markovitz, with the best network presenting an out-of-sample Sharpe Ratio 20% higher than the best performing classical model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AI Reasoning: A Hamiltonian Dynamics Approach to Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to analyzing and improving multi-hop reasoning in AI systems by drawing inspiration from Hamiltonian mechanics. We propose a novel framework that maps reasoning chains in embedding spaces to Hamiltonian systems, allowing us to leverage powerful analytical tools from classical physics. Our method defines a Hamiltonian function that balances the progression of reasoning (kinetic energy) against the relevance to the question at hand (potential energy). Using this framework, we analyze a large dataset of reasoning chains from a multi-hop question-answering task, revealing intriguing patterns that distinguish valid from invalid reasoning. We show that valid reasoning chains have lower Hamiltonian energy and move in ways that make the best trade-off between getting more information and answering the right question. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this framework to steer the creation of more efficient reasoning algorithms within AI systems. Our results not only provide new insights into the nature of valid reasoning but also open up exciting possibilities for physics-inspired approaches to understanding and improving artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning has recently emerged as a promising solution for a comprehensive understanding of complex scenes. In addition to being memory-efficient, multi-task models, when appropriately designed, can facilitate the exchange of complementary signals across tasks. In this work, we jointly address 2D semantic segmentation and three geometry-related tasks: dense depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and edge estimation, demonstrating their benefits on both indoor and outdoor datasets. We propose a novel multi-task learning architecture that leverages pairwise cross-task exchange through correlation-guided attention and self-attention to enhance the overall representation learning for all tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across three multi-task setups, showing the advantages of our approach compared to competitive baselines in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Additionally, we extend our method to the novel multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/cv-rits/DenseMTL</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies has led to the widespread availability and effectiveness of text generation tools such as ChatGPT and Claude. While highly useful, these technologies also pose significant risks to the credibility of various media forms if they are employed for paraphrased plagiarism -- one of the most subtle forms of content misuse in scientific literature and general text media. Although automated methods for paraphrase identification have been developed, detecting this type of plagiarism remains challenging due to the inconsistent nature of the datasets used to train these methods. In this article, we examine traditional and contemporary approaches to paraphrase identification, investigating how the under-representation of certain paraphrase types in popular datasets, including those used to train Large Language Models (LLMs), affects the ability to detect plagiarism. We introduce and validate a new refined typology for paraphrases (ReParaphrased, REfined PARAPHRASE typology definitions) to better understand the disparities in paraphrase type representation. Lastly, we propose new directions for future research and dataset development to enhance AI-based paraphrase detection.</description>

      <title>Unification of popular artificial neural network activation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified representation of the most popular neural network activation functions. Adopting Mittag-Leffler functions of fractional calculus, we propose a flexible and compact functional form that is able to interpolate between various activation functions and mitigate common problems in training neural networks such as vanishing and exploding gradients. The presented gated representation extends the scope of fixed-shape activation functions to their adaptive counterparts whose shape can be learnt from the training data. The derivatives of the proposed functional form can also be expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions making it a suitable candidate for gradient-based backpropagation algorithms. By training multiple neural networks of different complexities on various datasets with different sizes, we demonstrate that adopting a unified gated representation of activation functions offers a promising and affordable alternative to individual built-in implementations of activation functions in conventional machine learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Geolocation of Tweets Using transformer models on Customized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research is aimed to solve the tweet/user geolocation prediction task and provide a flexible methodology for the geotagging of textual big data. The suggested approach implements neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) to estimate the location as coordinate pairs (longitude, latitude) and two-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The scope of proposed models has been finetuned on a Twitter dataset using pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as base models. Performance metrics show a median error of fewer than 30 km on a worldwide-level, and fewer than 15 km on the US-level datasets for the models trained and evaluated on text features of tweets' content and metadata context. Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/K4TEL/geo-twitter.git</description>

      <title>Matryoshka Policy Gradient for Entropy-Regularized RL: Convergence and Global Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Policy Gradient (PG) algorithm, called $\textit{Matryoshka Policy Gradient}$ (MPG), is introduced and studied, in the context of fixed-horizon max-entropy reinforcement learning, where an agent aims at maximizing entropy bonuses additional to its cumulative rewards. In the linear function approximation setting with softmax policies, we prove uniqueness and characterize the optimal policy of the entropy regularized objective, together with global convergence of MPG. These results are proved in the case of continuous state and action space. MPG is intuitive, theoretically sound and we furthermore show that the optimal policy of the infinite horizon max-entropy objective can be approximated arbitrarily well by the optimal policy of the MPG framework. Finally, we provide a criterion for global optimality when the policy is parametrized by a neural network in terms of the neural tangent kernel at convergence. As a proof of concept, we evaluate numerically MPG on standard test benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Two is Better Than One: Digital Siblings to Improve Autonomous Driving Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based testing represents an important step to ensure the reliability of autonomous driving software. In practice, when companies rely on third-party general-purpose simulators, either for in-house or outsourced testing, the generalizability of testing results to real autonomous vehicles is at stake. In this paper, we enhance simulation-based testing by introducing the notion of digital siblings, a multi-simulator approach that tests a given autonomous vehicle on multiple general-purpose simulators built with different technologies, that operate collectively as an ensemble in the testing process.
  We exemplify our approach on a case study focused on testing the lane-keeping component of an autonomous vehicle. We use two open-source simulators as digital siblings, and we empirically compare such a multi-simulator approach against a digital twin of a physical scaled autonomous vehicle on a large set of test cases. Our approach requires generating and running test cases for each individual simulator, in the form of sequences of road points. Then, test cases are migrated between simulators, using feature maps to characterize the exercised driving conditions. Finally, the joint predicted failure probability is computed, and a failure is reported only in cases of agreement among the siblings.
  Our empirical evaluation shows that the ensemble failure predictor by the digital siblings is superior to each individual simulator at predicting the failures of the digital twin. We discuss the findings of our case study and detail how our approach can help researchers interested in automated testing of autonomous driving software.</description>

      <title>Graph Propagation Transformer for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for graph representation learning. The core insight of our method is to fully consider the information propagation among nodes and edges in a graph when building the attention module in the transformer blocks. Specifically, we propose a new attention mechanism called Graph Propagation Attention (GPA). It explicitly passes the information among nodes and edges in three ways, i.e. node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node, which is essential for learning graph-structured data. On this basis, we design an effective transformer architecture named Graph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans) to further help learn graph data. We verify the performance of GPTrans in a wide range of graph learning experiments on several benchmark datasets. These results show that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art transformer-based graph models with better performance. The code will be released at https://github.com/czczup/GPTrans.</description>

      <title>Predictability and Fairness in Load Aggregation with Deadband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual power plants and load aggregation are becoming increasingly common. There, one regulates the aggregate power output of an ensemble of distributed energy resources (DERs). Marecek et al. [Automatica, Volume 147, January 2023, 110743, arXiv:2110.03001] recently suggested that long-term averages of prices or incentives offered should exist and be independent of the initial states of the operators of the DER, the aggregator, and the power grid. This can be seen as predictability, which underlies fairness. Unfortunately, the existence of such averages cannot be guaranteed with many traditional regulators, including the proportional-integral (PI) regulator with or without deadband. Here, we consider the effects of losses in the alternating current model and the deadband in the controller. This yields a non-linear dynamical system (due to the non-linear losses) exhibiting discontinuities (due to the deadband). We show that Filippov invariant measures enable reasoning about predictability and fairness while considering non-linearity of the alternating-current model and deadband.</description>

      <title>Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any autonomous controller will be unsafe in some situations. The ability to quantitatively identify when these unsafe situations are about to occur is crucial for drawing timely human oversight in, e.g., freight transportation applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the true criticality of an agent's situation can be robustly defined as the mean reduction in reward given some number of random actions. Proxy criticality metrics that are computable in real-time (i.e., without actually simulating the effects of random actions) can be compared to the true criticality, and we show how to leverage these proxy metrics to generate safety margins, which directly tie the consequences of potentially incorrect actions to an anticipated loss in overall performance. We evaluate our approach on learned policies from APE-X and A3C within an Atari environment, and demonstrate how safety margins decrease as agents approach failure states. The integration of safety margins into programs for monitoring deployed agents allows for the real-time identification of potentially catastrophic situations.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Neural Network Training: Efficient Optimization of Transformed Trimmed Loss with Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider outlier-robust predictive modeling using highly-expressive neural networks. To this end, we employ (1) a transformed trimmed loss (TTL), which is a computationally feasible variant of the classical trimmed loss, and (2) a higher-order variation regularization (HOVR) of the prediction model. Note that using only TTL to train the neural network may possess outlier vulnerability, as its high expressive power causes it to overfit even the outliers perfectly. However, simultaneously introducing HOVR constrains the effective degrees of freedom, thereby avoiding fitting outliers. We newly provide an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimization and its theoretical convergence guarantee. (*Two authors contributed equally to this work.)</description>

      <title>HC3 Plus: A Semantic-Invariant Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has garnered significant interest due to its impressive performance; however, there is growing concern about its potential risks, particularly in the detection of AI-generated content (AIGC), which is often challenging for untrained individuals to identify. Current datasets used for detecting ChatGPT-generated text primarily focus on question-answering tasks, often overlooking tasks with semantic-invariant properties, such as summarization, translation, and paraphrasing. In this paper, we demonstrate that detecting model-generated text in semantic-invariant tasks is more challenging. To address this gap, we introduce a more extensive and comprehensive dataset that incorporates a wider range of tasks than previous work, including those with semantic-invariant properties. In addition, instruction fine-tuning has demonstrated superior performance across various tasks. In this paper, we explore the use of instruction fine-tuning models for detecting text generated by ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Optimize Weight Rounding via Signed Gradient Descent for the Quantization of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language-related tasks, but their deployment poses significant challenges due to substantial memory and storage requirements. Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution, significantly reducing memory and storage needs without sacrificing too much performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that leverages signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping in just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), delivering exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while minimizing tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieved absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91% to 33.22% at 2bits, as measured by the average zero-shot accuracy across 11 tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalization in recent models, achieving near-lossless 4-bit quantization in most scenarios.

      <title>Kick Bad Guys Out! Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04055v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where malicious clients submit poisoned models to disrupt the convergence or plant backdoors that cause the global model to misclassify some samples. Current defense methods are often impractical for real-world FL systems, as they either rely on unrealistic prior knowledge or cause accuracy loss even in the absence of attacks. Furthermore, these methods lack a protocol for verifying execution, leaving participants uncertain about the correct execution of the mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection strategy that is designed for real-world FL systems. Our approach activates the defense only when potential attacks are detected, and enables the removal of malicious models without affecting the benign ones. Additionally, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity of the proposed defense mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing FL system security against a comprehensive set of adversarial attacks in various ML tasks.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Conversational Factor Information Retrieval Method (ConFIRM), a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific retrieval tasks. ConFIRM leverages the Five-Factor Model of personality to generate synthetic datasets that accurately reflect target population characteristics, addressing data scarcity in specialized domains. We demonstrate ConFIRM's effectiveness through a case study in the finance sector, fine-tuning a Llama-2-7b model using personality-aligned data from the PolyU-Asklora Fintech Adoption Index. The resulting model achieved 91% accuracy in classifying financial queries, with an average inference time of 0.61 seconds on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. ConFIRM shows promise for creating more accurate and personalized AI-driven information retrieval systems across various domains, potentially mitigating issues of hallucinations and outdated information in LLMs deployed</description>

      <title>Fuse Your Latents: Video Editing with Multi-source Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are renowned for their powerful capabilities in image and video synthesis. Yet, compared to text-to-image (T2I) editing, text-to-video (T2V) editing suffers from a lack of decent temporal consistency and structure, due to insufficient pre-training data, limited model editability, or extensive tuning costs. To address this gap, we propose FLDM (Fused Latent Diffusion Model), a training-free framework that achieves high-quality T2V editing by integrating various T2I and T2V LDMs. Specifically, FLDM utilizes a hyper-parameter with an update schedule to effectively fuse image and video latents during the denoising process. This paper is the first to reveal that T2I and T2V LDMs can complement each other in terms of structure and temporal consistency, ultimately generating high-quality videos. It is worth noting that FLDM can serve as a versatile plugin, applicable to off-the-shelf image and video LDMs, to significantly enhance the quality of video editing. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on popular T2I and T2V LDMs demonstrate FLDM's superior editing quality than state-of-the-art T2V editing methods. Our project code is available at https://github.com/lutianyi0603/fuse_your_latents.</description>

      <title>netFound: Foundation Model for Network Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing generalizable ML-based solutions for disparate learning problems in network security is highly desired. However, despite a rich history of applying ML to network security, most existing solutions lack generalizability. This lack of progress can be attributed to an overreliance on supervised learning techniques and the associated challenges of curating well-specified labeled training data. This paper addresses a fundamental gap by introducing a novel transformer-based network foundation model, netFound. We employ self-supervised learning techniques on abundant, unlabeled network telemetry data for pre-training. This pretrained model can subsequently be fine-tuned to create generalizable learning artifacts for disparate learning tasks, even when using commonly available but challenging labeled datasets that are sparse, noisy, and skewed. To realize this goal, netFound leverages various domain-specific attributes and constraints unique to network data (packet traces) by developing multi-modal embeddings, protocol-aware tokenization, data-driven token composition, and hierarchical transformers. Our results demonstrate that netFound's domain-specific design choices ensure that it (1) effectively captures the hidden networking context in production settings, (2) outperforms four different SOTA methods on five different learning tasks, and (3) is robust to both noisy labels and learning shortcuts -- critical for developing generalizable ML models in practical settings.</description>

      <title>A Stability Principle for Learning under Non-Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework for statistical learning in non-stationary environments. In each time period, our approach applies a stability principle to select a look-back window that maximizes the utilization of historical data while keeping the cumulative bias within an acceptable range relative to the stochastic error. Our theory and numerical experiments showcase the adaptivity of this approach to unknown non-stationarity. We prove regret bounds that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors when the population losses are strongly convex, or Lipschitz only. At the heart of our analysis lie two novel components: a measure of similarity between functions and a segmentation technique for dividing the non-stationary data sequence into quasi-stationary pieces.</description>

      <title>When "A Helpful Assistant" Is Not Really Helpful: Personas in System Prompts Do Not Improve Performances of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ``You are a helpful assistant'' as part of its default system prompt. Despite current practices of adding personas to system prompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model's performance on objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model performance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction accuracies. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies and found that, while aggregating results from the best persona for each question significantly improves prediction accuracy, automatically identifying the best persona is challenging, with predictions often performing no better than random selection. Overall, our findings suggest that while adding a persona may lead to performance gains in certain settings, the effect of each persona can be largely random.

      <title>Griffon: Spelling out All Object Locations at Any Granularity with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replicating the innate human ability to detect all objects based on free-form texts at any granularity remains a formidable challenge for Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Current LVLMs are predominantly constrained to locate a single, pre-existing object. This limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research uncovers LVLMs' capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel Language-prompted Localization Dataset to fully unleash the capabilities of LVLMs in fine-grained object perception and precise location awareness. More importantly, we present Griffon, a purely LVLM-based baseline, which does not introduce any special tokens, expert models, or additional detection modules. It simply maintains a consistent structure with popular LVLMs by unifying data formats across various localization-related scenarios and is trained end-to-end through a well-designed pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Griffon not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained RefCOCO series and Flickr30K Entities but also approaches the capabilities of the expert model Faster RCNN on the detection benchmark MSCOCO. Data, codes, and models are released at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/Griffon.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient 3D Object Detection in Bird's-Eye-View Space for Autonomous Driving: A Convolutional-Only Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D object detection in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space has recently emerged as a prevalent approach in the field of autonomous driving. Despite the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and velocity estimation compared to perspective view methods, the deployment of BEV-based techniques in real-world autonomous vehicles remains challenging. This is primarily due to their reliance on vision-transformer (ViT) based architectures, which introduce quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. To address this issue, we propose an efficient BEV-based 3D detection framework called BEVENet, which leverages a convolutional-only architectural design to circumvent the limitations of ViT models while maintaining the effectiveness of BEV-based methods. Our experiments show that BEVENet is 3$\times$ faster than contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the NuScenes challenge, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.456 and a nuScenes detection score (NDS) of 0.555 on the NuScenes validation dataset, with an inference speed of 47.6 frames per second. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first to achieve such significant efficiency improvements for BEV-based methods, highlighting their enhanced feasibility for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>LogicAsker: Evaluating and Improving the Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LogicAsker, a novel approach for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Federated Learning for Cancer Staging over Non-IID Datasets with Unbalanced Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) for cancer staging through medical image analysis has gained substantial interest across medical disciplines. When accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure. Given the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records, leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise for cancer staging.
  However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a portion of data modalities within the system. In this work, we introduce a novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting strategy tailored for multi-modal FL. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments using The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) datalake considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information. Our results further unveil the impact and severity of class-based vs type-based heterogeneity across institutions on the model performance, which widens the perspective to the notion of data heterogeneity in multi-modal FL literature.</description>

      <title>ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code Snippets using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technical Q&amp;A sites are valuable for software developers seeking knowledge, but the code snippets they provide are often uncompilable and incomplete due to unresolved types and missing libraries. This poses a challenge for users who wish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focus on creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates in two stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing import statements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g., compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntax issues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset, Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20 most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods, improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to the state-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements (with an F1 score of 0.98) than SnR, with an improvement of 8.5% in the F1.</description>

      <title>LM-HT SNN: Enhancing the Performance of SNN to ANN Counterpart through Learnable Multi-hierarchical Threshold Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has garnered widespread academic interest for its intrinsic ability to transmit information in a more energy-efficient manner. However, despite previous efforts to optimize the learning algorithm of SNNs through various methods, SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of performance. The recently proposed multi-threshold model provides more possibilities for further enhancing the learning capability of SNNs. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the relationship among the multi-threshold model, vanilla spiking model and quantized ANNs from a mathematical perspective, then propose a novel LM-HT model, which is an equidistant multi-threshold model that can dynamically regulate the global input current and membrane potential leakage on the time dimension. The LM-HT model can also be transformed into a vanilla single threshold model through reparameterization, thereby achieving more flexible hardware deployment. In addition, we note that the LM-HT model can seamlessly integrate with ANN-SNN Conversion framework under special initialization. This novel hybrid learning framework can effectively improve the relatively poor performance of converted SNNs under low time latency. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our model can outperform previous state-of-the-art works on various types of datasets, which promote SNNs to achieve a brand-new level of performance comparable to quantized ANNs.

      <title>LLMs learn governing principles of dynamical systems, revealing an in-context neural scaling law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current deep learning models are not designed to simultaneously address three fundamental questions: predict class labels to solve a given classification task (the "What?"), simulate changes in the situation to evaluate how this impacts class predictions (the "How?"), and imagine how the scenario should change to result in different class predictions (the "Why not?"). The inability to answer these questions represents a crucial gap in deploying reliable AI agents, calibrating human trust, and improving human-machine interaction. To bridge this gap, we introduce CounterFactual Concept Bottleneck Models (CF-CBMs), a class of models designed to efficiently address the above queries all at once without the need to run post-hoc searches. Our experimental results demonstrate that CF-CBMs: achieve classification accuracy comparable to black-box models and existing CBMs ("What?"), rely on fewer important concepts leading to simpler explanations ("How?"), and produce interpretable, concept-based counterfactuals ("Why not?"). Additionally, we show that training the counterfactual generator jointly with the CBM leads to two key improvements: (i) it alters the model's decision-making process, making the model rely on fewer important concepts (leading to simpler explanations), and (ii) it significantly increases the causal effect of concept interventions on class predictions, making the model more responsive to these changes.</description>

      <title>Preference Poisoning Attacks on Reward Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning reward models from pairwise comparisons is a fundamental component in a number of domains, including autonomous control, conversational agents, and recommendation systems, as part of a broad goal of aligning automated decisions with user preferences. These approaches entail collecting preference information from people, with feedback often provided anonymously. Since preferences are subjective, there is no gold standard to compare against; yet, reliance of high-impact systems on preference learning creates a strong motivation for malicious actors to skew data collected in this fashion to their ends. We investigate the nature and extent of this vulnerability by considering an attacker who can flip a small subset of preference comparisons to either promote or demote a target outcome. We propose two classes of algorithmic approaches for these attacks: a gradient-based framework, and several variants of rank-by-distance methods. Next, we evaluate the efficacy of best attacks in both these classes in successfully achieving malicious goals on datasets from three domains: autonomous control, recommendation system, and textual prompt-response preference learning. We find that the best attacks are often highly successful, achieving in the most extreme case 100\% success rate with only 0.3\% of the data poisoned. However, \emph{which} attack is best can vary significantly across domains. In addition, we observe that the simpler and more scalable rank-by-distance approaches are often competitive with, and on occasion significantly outperform, gradient-based methods. Finally, we show that state-of-the-art defenses against other classes of poisoning attacks exhibit limited efficacy in our setting.</description>

Abstract: Automated long-form story generation typically employs long-context large language models (LLMs) for one-shot creation, which can produce cohesive but not necessarily engaging content. We introduce Storytelling With Action Guidance (SWAG), a novel approach to storytelling with LLMs. Our approach frames story writing as a search problem through a two-model feedback loop: one LLM generates story content, and another auxiliary LLM is used to choose the next best "action" to steer the story's future direction. Our results show that SWAG can substantially outperform previous end-to-end story generation techniques when evaluated by GPT-4 and through human evaluation. Our SWAG pipeline using only small open-source models surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models make a breakthrough in natural language processing tasks (NLP), multimodal technique becomes extremely popular. However, it has been shown that multimodal NLP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the outputs of a model can be dramatically changed by a perturbation to the input. While several defense techniques have been proposed both in computer vision and NLP models, the multimodal robustness of models have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by modifying loss function of pre-trained multimodal models, by restricting top K softmax outputs. Based on the evaluation and scoring, our experiments show that after a fine-tuning, adversarial robustness of pre-trained models can be significantly improved, against popular attacks. Further research should be studying, such as output diversity, generalization and the robustness-performance trade-off of this kind of loss functions. Our code will be available after this paper is accepted</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address private deep offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the goal is to train a policy on standard control tasks that is differentially private (DP) with respect to individual trajectories in the dataset. To achieve this, we introduce PriMORL, a model-based RL algorithm with formal differential privacy guarantees. PriMORL first learns an ensemble of trajectory-level DP models of the environment from offline data. It then optimizes a policy on the penalized private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the dataset. In addition to offering strong theoretical foundations, we demonstrate empirically that PriMORL enables the training of private RL agents on offline continuous control tasks with deep function approximations, whereas current methods are limited to simpler tabular and linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We furthermore outline the trade-offs involved in achieving privacy in this setting.</description>

      <title>Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning to Compose Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks. On both training LLaMA models from scratch and prompting on GPT-4 and Gemini, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models.</description>

      <title>Synergistic eigenanalysis of covariance and Hessian matrices for enhanced binary classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariance and Hessian matrices have been analyzed separately in the literature for classification problems. However, integrating these matrices has the potential to enhance their combined power in improving classification performance. We present a novel approach that combines the eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability in binary classification tasks. Our approach is substantiated by formal proofs that establish its capability to maximize between-class mean distance (the concept of \textit{separation}) and minimize within-class variances (the concept of \textit{compactness}), which together define the two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) criteria, particularly under ideal data conditions such as isotropy around class means and dominant leading eigenvalues. By projecting data into the combined space of the most relevant eigendirections from both matrices, we achieve optimal class separability as per these LDA criteria. Empirical validation across neural and health datasets consistently supports our theoretical framework and demonstrates that our method outperforms established methods. Our method stands out by addressing both separation and compactness criteria, unlike PCA and the Hessian method, which predominantly emphasize one criterion each. This comprehensive approach captures intricate patterns and relationships, enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, through the utilization of both LDA criteria, our method outperforms LDA itself by leveraging higher-dimensional feature spaces, in accordance with Cover's theorem, which favors linear separability in higher dimensions. Additionally, our approach sheds light on complex DNN decision-making, rendering them comprehensible within a 2D space.</description>

      <title>Ising on the Graph: Task-specific Graph Subsampling via the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing a graph while preserving its overall structure is an important problem with many applications. Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion. For this, the task's loss function does not have to be differentiable. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications: image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.</description>

      <title>Can Separators Improve Chain-of-Thought Prompting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a simple and effective method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The basic idea of CoT is to let LLMs break down their thought processes step-by-step by putting exemplars in the input prompt. However, the densely structured prompt exemplars of CoT may cause the cognitive overload of LLMs. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce COT-SEP, a method that strategically employs separators at the end of each exemplar in CoT prompting. These separators are designed to help the LLMs understand their thought processes better while reasoning. Interestingly, it turns out that COT-SEP significantly improves the LLMs' performances on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA), compared with the vanilla CoT, which does not use separators. We also study the effects of the type and the location of separators tested on multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 7B.</description>

      <title>On the Byzantine-Resilience of Distillation-Based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) algorithms using Knowledge Distillation (KD) have received increasing attention due to their favorable properties with respect to privacy, non-i.i.d. data and communication cost. These methods depart from transmitting model parameters and instead communicate information about a learning task by sharing predictions on a public dataset. In this work, we study the performance of such approaches in the byzantine setting, where a subset of the clients act in an adversarial manner aiming to disrupt the learning process. We show that KD-based FL algorithms are remarkably resilient and analyze how byzantine clients can influence the learning process. Based on these insights, we introduce two new byzantine attacks and demonstrate their ability to break existing byzantine-resilient methods. Additionally, we propose a novel defence method which enhances the byzantine resilience of KD-based FL algorithms. Finally, we provide a general framework to obfuscate attacks, making them significantly harder to detect, thereby improving their effectiveness. Our findings serve as an important building block in the analysis of byzantine FL, contributing through the development of new attacks and new defence mechanisms, further advancing the robustness of KD-based FL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive Exploration for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information (geometry and semantics) and high-level information (action-conditioned relationships between different entities) in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects, and deformable objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning has become essential in various domains, including recommendation systems and social network analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenGraph.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Focused Fact Summarization for Knowledge-Augmented Zero-Shot Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have investigated utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance Quesetion Answering (QA) performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet structured KG verbalization remains challengin. Existing methods, such as triple-form or free-form textual conversion of triple-form facts, encounter several issues. These include reduced evidence density due to duplicated entities or relationships, and reduced evidence clarity due to an inability to emphasize crucial evidence. To address these issues, we propose EFSum, an Evidence-focused Fact Summarization framework for enhanced QA with knowledge-augmented LLMs. We optimize an open-source LLM as a fact summarizer through distillation and preference alignment. Our extensive experiments show that EFSum improves LLM's zero-shot QA performance, and it is possible to ensure both the helpfulness and faithfulness of the summary.</description>

      <title>ObjectCompose: Evaluating Resilience of Vision-Based Models on Object-to-Background Compositional Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations. The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions. Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models. We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.

      <title>Rebuilding ROME : Resolving Model Collapse during Sequential Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), a popular model editing method, has shown that there are certain facts that the algorithm is unable to edit without breaking the model. Such edits have previously been called disabling edits. These disabling edits cause immediate model collapse and limits the use of ROME for sequential editing. In this paper, we show that disabling edits are an artifact of irregularities in the implementation of ROME. With this paper, we provide a more stable implementation ROME, which we call r-ROME and show that model collapse is no longer observed when making large scale sequential edits with r-ROME, while further improving generalization and locality of model editing compared to the original implementation of ROME. We also provide a detailed mathematical explanation of the reason behind disabling edits.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Classifiers Improve Stability and Efficiency in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applications in dynamic environments, where machine learning models must adapt to changing data distributions while retaining knowledge of previous tasks. Despite significant advancements, catastrophic forgetting - where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new information is learned - remains a key challenge. In this work, we investigate the stability of intermediate neural network layers during continual learning and explore how auxiliary classifiers (ACs) can leverage this stability to improve performance. We show that early network layers remain more stable during learning, particularly for older tasks, and that ACs applied to these layers can outperform standard classifiers on past tasks. By integrating ACs into several continual learning algorithms, we demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvements on standard benchmarks. Additionally, we explore dynamic inference, showing that AC-augmented continual learning methods can reduce computational costs by up to 60\% while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of standard methods. Our findings suggest that ACs offer a promising avenue for enhancing continual learning models, providing both improved performance and the ability to adapt the network computation in environments where such flexibility might be required.</description>

      <title>DSEG-LIME: Improving Image Explanation by Hierarchical Data-Driven Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence is critical in unraveling decision-making processes in complex machine learning models. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a well-known XAI framework for image analysis. It utilizes image segmentation to create features to identify relevant areas for classification. Consequently, poor segmentation can compromise the consistency of the explanation and undermine the importance of the segments, affecting the overall interpretability. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME), featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation, and ii) a hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. We benchmark DSEG-LIME on pre-trained models with images from the ImageNet dataset - scenarios without domain-specific knowledge. The analysis includes a quantitative evaluation using established XAI metrics, complemented by a qualitative assessment through a user study. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms in most of the XAI metrics and enhances the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts, significantly improving interpretability.

      <title>Reward Guided Latent Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent Consistency Distillation (LCD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient text-to-image synthesis. By distilling a latent consistency model (LCM) from a pre-trained teacher latent diffusion model (LDM), LCD facilitates the generation of high-fidelity images within merely 2 to 4 inference steps. However, the LCM's efficient inference is obtained at the cost of the sample quality. In this paper, we propose compensating the quality loss by aligning LCM's output with human preference during training. Specifically, we introduce Reward Guided LCD (RG-LCD), which integrates feedback from a reward model (RM) into the LCD process by augmenting the original LCD loss with the objective of maximizing the reward associated with LCM's single-step generation. As validated through human evaluation, when trained with the feedback of a good RM, the 2-step generations from our RG-LCM are favored by humans over the 50-step DDIM samples from the teacher LDM, representing a 25-time inference acceleration without quality loss.
  As directly optimizing towards differentiable RMs can suffer from over-optimization, we take the initial step to overcome this difficulty by proposing the use of a latent proxy RM (LRM). This novel component serves as an intermediary, connecting our LCM with the RM. Empirically, we demonstrate that incorporating the LRM into our RG-LCD successfully avoids high-frequency noise in the generated images, contributing to both improved Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) on MS-COCO and a higher HPSv2.1 score on HPSv2's test set, surpassing those achieved by the baseline LCM.</description>

      <title>S-JEPA: towards seamless cross-dataset transfer through dynamic spatial attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenge of seamless cross-dataset transfer in EEG signal processing, this article presents an exploratory study on the use of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs). In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for transfer learning in various domains. However, its application to EEG signals remains largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce Signal-JEPA for representing EEG recordings which includes a novel domain-specific spatial block masking strategy and three novel architectures for downstream classification. The study is conducted on a 54 subjects dataset and the downstream performance of the models is evaluated on three different BCI paradigms: motor imagery, ERP and SSVEP. Our study provides preliminary evidence for the potential of JEPAs in EEG signal encoding. Notably, our results highlight the importance of spatial filtering for accurate downstream classification and reveal an influence of the length of the pre-training examples but not of the mask size on the downstream performance.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Model Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ROME and MEMIT are largely believed to be two different model editing algorithms, with the major difference between them being the ability to perform batched edits. In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective, their abilities (singular and batched editing), their model editing performance and their limitations.</description>

      <title>QKFormer: Hierarchical Spiking Transformer using Q-K Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/zhouchenlin2096/QKFormer</description>

      <title>PeersimGym: An Environment for Solving the Task Offloading Problem with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task offloading, crucial for balancing computational loads across devices in networks such as the Internet of Things, poses significant optimization challenges, including minimizing latency and energy usage under strict communication and storage constraints. While traditional optimization falls short in scalability; and heuristic approaches lack in achieving optimal outcomes, Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue by enabling the learning of optimal offloading strategies through iterative interactions. However, the efficacy of RL hinges on access to rich datasets and custom-tailored, realistic training environments. To address this, we introduce PeersimGym, an open-source, customizable simulation environment tailored for developing and optimizing task offloading strategies within computational networks. PeersimGym supports a wide range of network topologies and computational constraints and integrates a \textit{PettingZoo}-based interface for RL agent deployment in both solo and multi-agent setups. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the environment through experiments with Deep Reinforcement Learning agents, showcasing the potential of RL-based approaches to significantly enhance offloading strategies in distributed computing settings. PeersimGym thus bridges the gap between theoretical RL models and their practical applications, paving the way for advancements in efficient task offloading methodologies.</description>

      <title>A Data-to-Product Multimodal Conceptual Framework to Achieve Automated Software Evolution for Context-rich Intelligent Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While AI is extensively transforming Software Engineering (SE) fields, SE is still in need of a framework to overall consider all phases to facilitate Automated Software Evolution (ASEv), particularly for intelligent applications that are context-rich, instead of conquering each division independently. Its complexity comes from the intricacy of the intelligent applications, the heterogeneity of the data sources, and the constant changes in the context. This study proposes a conceptual framework for achieving automated software evolution, emphasizing the importance of multimodality learning. A Selective Sequential Scope Model (3S) model is developed based on the conceptual framework, and it can be used to categorize existing and future research when it covers different SE phases and multimodal learning tasks. This research is a preliminary step toward the blueprint of a higher-level ASEv. The proposed conceptual framework can act as a practical guideline for practitioners to prepare themselves for diving into this area. Although the study is about intelligent applications, the framework and analysis methods may be adapted for other types of software as AI brings more intelligence into their life cycles.</description>

      <title>SGFormer: Spherical Geometry Transformer for 360 Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic distortion poses a significant challenge in 360 depth estimation, particularly pronounced at the north and south poles. Existing methods either adopt a bi-projection fusion strategy to remove distortions or model long-range dependencies to capture global structures, which can result in either unclear structure or insufficient local perception. In this paper, we propose a spherical geometry transformer, named SGFormer, to address the above issues, with an innovative step to integrate spherical geometric priors into vision transformers. To this end, we retarget the transformer decoder to a spherical prior decoder (termed SPDecoder), which endeavors to uphold the integrity of spherical structures during decoding. Concretely, we leverage bipolar re-projection, circular rotation, and curve local embedding to preserve the spherical characteristics of equidistortion, continuity, and surface distance, respectively. Furthermore, we present a query-based global conditional position embedding to compensate for spatial structure at varying resolutions. It not only boosts the global perception of spatial position but also sharpens the depth structure across different patches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating our superiority over state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of Expert Router for Scalable LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced widespread adoption across scientific and industrial domains due to their versatility and utility for diverse tasks. Nevertheless, deploying and serving these models at scale with optimal throughput and latency remains a significant challenge, primarily because of LLMs' high computational and memory demands. Specialized models optimized for specific tasks can be combined through a routing mechanism to address these challenges, creating a modular inference system. This paper introduces Expert Router, a scalable routing architecture that directs prompts to specialized expert models. We characterize multiple Expert Router configurations, including different LLama 3 models with quantized and non-quantized weights under up to 1,000 concurrent users. Our findings reveal that Expert Router introduces minimal latency overhead, with the configuration of expert models being a dominating factor in performance outcomes. High-parameter expert models deliver stable throughput and latency under moderate concurrency levels. In contrast, smaller expert models maintain competitive performance across a wider range of concurrent users compared to tensor-parallelized baseline models. This highlights the potential of Expert Router for efficient and scalable LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>From Persona to Personalization: A Survey on Role-Playing Language Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate assigned personas. By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance. RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals. Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies. We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services. We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation. Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs. Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research. Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.</description>

      <title>Scalable Event-by-event Processing of Neuromorphic Sensory Signals With Deep State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference. We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams. We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 7.7% to 88.4%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>New contexts, old heuristics: How young people in India and the US trust online content in the age of generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted in-person ethnography in India and the US to investigate how young people (18-24) trusted online content, just as generative AI (genAI) became mainstream. We found that when online, how participants determined what content to trust was shaped by emotional states, which we term "information modes." Our participants reflexively shifted between modes to maintain "emotional equilibrium," and eschewed engaging literacy skills in the more passive modes in which they spent the most time. We found participants imported trust heuristics from established online contexts into emerging ones (i.e., genAI). This led them to use ill-fitting trust heuristics, and exposed them to the risk of trusting false and misleading information. While many had reservations about AI, prioritizing efficiency, they used genAI and habitual heuristics to quickly achieve goals at the expense of accuracy. We conclude that literacy interventions designed to match users' distinct information modes will be most effective.</description>

      <title>Truthful Aggregation of LLMs with an Application to Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next frontier of online advertising is revenue generation from LLM-generated content. We consider a setting where advertisers aim to influence the responses of an LLM to align with their interests, while platforms seek to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. The challenge is that advertisers' preferences generally conflict with those of the user, and advertisers may misreport their preferences. To address this, we introduce MOSAIC, an auction mechanism that ensures that truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for advertisers and that aligns the utility of each advertiser with their contribution to social welfare. Importantly, the mechanism operates without LLM fine-tuning or access to model weights and provably converges to the output of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources increase. Additionally, it can incorporate contextual information about advertisers, which significantly improves social welfare. Through experiments with a publicly available LLM, we show that MOSAIC leads to high advertiser value and platform revenue with low computational overhead. While our motivating application is online advertising, our mechanism can be applied in any setting with monetary transfers, making it a general-purpose solution for truthfully aggregating the preferences of self-interested agents over LLM-generated replies.</description>

      <title>LLMC: Benchmarking Large Language Model Quantization with a Versatile Compression Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are propelling us toward artificial general intelligence with their remarkable emergent abilities and reasoning capabilities. However, the substantial computational and memory requirements limit the widespread adoption. Quantization, a key compression technique, can effectively mitigate these demands by compressing and accelerating LLMs, albeit with potential risks to accuracy. Numerous studies have aimed to minimize the accuracy loss associated with quantization. However, their quantization configurations vary from each other and cannot be fairly compared. In this paper, we present LLMC, a plug-and-play compression toolkit, to fairly and systematically explore the impact of quantization. LLMC integrates dozens of algorithms, models, and hardwares, offering high extensibility from integer to floating-point quantization, from LLM to vision-language (VLM) model, from fixed-bit to mixed precision, and from quantization to sparsification. Powered by this versatile toolkit, our benchmark covers three key aspects: calibration data, algorithms (three strategies), and data formats, providing novel insights and detailed analyses for further research and practical guidance for users. Our toolkit is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/llmc.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment.</description>

      <title>MeteoRA: Multiple-tasks Embedded LoRA for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pretrain+fine-tune paradigm is foundational for deploying large language models (LLMs) across various downstream applications. Within this framework, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), producing numerous reusable task-specific LoRA adapters. However, this approach requires explicit task intention selection, posing challenges for autonomous task sensing and switching during inference with multiple existing LoRA adapters embedded in a single LLM. In this work, we introduce MeteoRA (Multiple-tasks embedded LoRA), a scalable and efficient framework that reuses multiple task-specific LoRA adapters into the base LLM via a full-mode Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This framework also includes novel MoE forward acceleration strategies to address the efficiency challenges of traditional MoE implementations. Our evaluation, using the LlaMA2-13B and LlaMA3-8B base models equipped with 28 existing LoRA adapters through MeteoRA, demonstrates equivalent performance with the traditional PEFT method. Moreover, the LLM equipped with MeteoRA achieves superior performance in handling composite tasks, effectively solving ten sequential problems in a single inference pass, thereby demonstrating the framework's enhanced capability for timely adapter switching.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mixture of Experts: An Auto-Tuning Approach for Efficient Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results. However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DynMoE.</description>

      <title>Extracting Heuristics from Large Language Models for Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is further pronounced in case of stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function for all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging, even for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using LLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's sample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this LLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for the downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the MDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using an LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across multiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the BabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the advantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to generate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the sample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated heuristics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Safeguarding the Adversarial Robustness of Retrieval-Based In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of large language models, such as LLaMA and OpenAI GPT-3, In-Context Learning (ICL) gained significant attention due to its effectiveness and efficiency. However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, and verbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. Retrieval-Augmented ICL methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract semantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields more accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial attacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved data, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models can enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL with a 4.87% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit overconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2% increase in ASR for demonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness of ICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be too costly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effective training-free adversarial defence method, DARD, which enriches the example pool with those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements in performance and robustness, achieving a 15% reduction in ASR over the baselines. Code and data are released to encourage further research: https://github.com/simonucl/adv-retreival-icl</description>

      <title>AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Conditional Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</description>

      <title>Causal Concept Graph Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying the decisions of deep neural network (DNN) models. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, circumventing causal opacity in DNNs represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Are Universal PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits the generalization of neural solvers to diverse PDEs, impeding them from being practical surrogate models for numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE Solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by training a novel Transformer model on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance gains and favorable PDE generalizability.</description>

      <title>LoRA-XS: Low-Rank Adaptation with Extremely Small Number of Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has underscored the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) emerging as a popular solution. Although LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, serving multiple (task or user-specific) LoRA modules on top of a base model still creates significant storage challenges. To address this, using theoretical derivation, we introduce LoRA-XS (Low-Rank Adaptation with eXtremely Small number of parameters), a novel low-rank adaptation method that considerably reduces the trainable parameters while showing superior or competitive performance. LoRA-XS achieves this by inserting a small, trainable r x r weight matrix between frozen low-rank matrices, which are constructed by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the original weight matrix. This lightweight matrix enables fine-tuning with drastically reduced storage requirements, making it feasible to deploy millions of personalized models while minimizing memory overhead. For instance, LoRA-XS achieves a remarkable reduction of trainable parameters by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Our evaluations across various benchmarks (including GLUE, GSM8K, MATH, and eight commonsense reasoning datasets) demonstrate that LoRA-XS performs competitively or better than LoRA and other recent methods like VeRA while being significantly more parameter efficient. We also provide an extensive ablation study on the importance of singular vectors in transformer weights, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms driving LoRA-XS's enhanced efficiency. These findings suggest that LoRA-XS is not only a storage-efficient alternative, but also a powerful tool for scaling and personalizing LLMs at unprecedented scales.</description>

      <title>Quest: Query-centric Data Synthesis Approach for Long-context Scaling of Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19846v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the importance of extending context lengths for handling complex tasks. While traditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long documents, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model performance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation (Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed. However, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both aspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating semantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to predict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar queries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior performance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context lengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model sizes.</description>

      <title>Improving the Training of Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with \emph{knowledge distillation} methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 75\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.

      <title>HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)-a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Categorical and Hierarchical Concepts in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male, female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear. While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues. To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity. Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO.

      <title>How Far Can Transformers Reason? The Globality Barrier and Inductive Scratchpad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can Transformers predict new syllogisms by composing established ones? More generally, what type of targets can be learned by such models from scratch? Recent works show that Transformers can be Turing-complete in terms of expressivity, but this does not address the learnability objective. This paper puts forward the notion of 'globality degree' of a target distribution to capture when weak learning is efficiently achievable by regular Transformers, where the latter measures the least number of tokens required in addition to the tokens histogram to correlate nontrivially with the target. As shown experimentally and theoretically under additional assumptions, distributions with high globality cannot be learned efficiently. In particular, syllogisms cannot be composed on long chains. Furthermore, we show that (i) an agnostic scratchpad cannot help to break the globality barrier, (ii) an educated scratchpad can help if it breaks the globality at each step, however not all such scratchpads can generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, (iii) a notion of 'inductive scratchpad', that composes the prior information more efficiently, can both break the globality barrier and improve the OOD generalization. In particular, some inductive scratchpads can achieve length generalizations of up to 6x for some arithmetic tasks depending on the input formatting.</description>

      <title>Coprocessor Actor Critic: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach For Adaptive Brain Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive brain stimulation can treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and post-stroke motor deficits by influencing abnormal neural activity. Because of patient heterogeneity, each patient requires a unique stimulation policy to achieve optimal neural responses. Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) holds promise in learning effective policies for a variety of similar control tasks, but is limited in domains like brain stimulation by a need for numerous costly environment interactions. In this work we introduce Coprocessor Actor Critic, a novel, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach for learning neural coprocessor policies for brain stimulation. Our key insight is that coprocessor policy learning is a combination of learning how to act optimally in the world and learning how to induce optimal actions in the world through stimulation of an injured brain. We show that our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional MFRL methods in terms of sample efficiency and task success and outperforms baseline MBRL approaches in a neurologically realistic model of an injured brain.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{PLUM}$: Improving Code LMs with Execution-Guided On-Policy Preference Learning Driven By Synthetic Test Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning provides a promising solution to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for code language models, where the model is not explicitly trained to differentiate between correct and incorrect code. Recent findings demonstrate that on-policy data is the key to successful preference learning, where the preference data is collected using the same policy LM being trained. Inspired by this, we propose PLUM, an on-policy $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{L}$earning framework A$\textbf{u}$gmented with test cases for code L$\textbf{M}$ s. The framework operates in three key stages: (1) automatic generation of test cases from natural language instructions, (2) creation of a preference data by evaluating candidate code solutions sampled from the policy, which can then be used to (3) train the policy LM. PLUM levitates the need to train reward models, allowing for large scale on-policy and online preference data collation. PLUM is evaluated on both standard benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP) and more challenging ones (LiveCodeBench), delivering substantial improvements over original SFT'ed models and other execution-feedback-driven approaches. We show PLUM's benefits are consistent across various widely-used code LMs even they have been well-trained with SFT. For example, PLUM increases pass rates by up to 4.8% on average on standard benchmarks and 11.8% on LiveCodeBench, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. We also demonstrate the benefits of on-policy and online preference learning by comprehensive experimentation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Wavelets: A Wavelet-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification is a crucial but challenging task due to the high dimensionality and complex spatial-spectral correlations inherent in hyperspectral data. This paper employs Wavelet-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (wav-kan) architecture tailored for efficient modeling of these intricate dependencies. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Wav-KAN incorporates wavelet functions as learnable activation functions, enabling non-linear mapping of the input spectral signatures. The wavelet-based activation allows Wav-KAN to effectively capture multi-scale spatial and spectral patterns through dilations and translations. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets (Salinas, Pavia, Indian Pines) demonstrates the superior performance of Wav-KAN compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and the recently proposed Spline-based KAN (Spline-KAN) model. In this work we are: (1) conducting more experiments on additional hyperspectral datasets (Pavia University, WHU-Hi, and Urban Hyperspectral Image) to further validate the generalizability of Wav-KAN; (2) developing a multiresolution Wav-KAN architecture to capture scale-invariant features; (3) analyzing the effect of dimensional reduction techniques on classification performance; (4) exploring optimization methods for tuning the hyperparameters of KAN models; and (5) comparing Wav-KAN with other state-of-the-art models in hyperspectral image classification.</description>

      <title>MeshAnything: Artist-Created Mesh Generation with Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, 3D assets created via reconstruction and generation have matched the quality of manually crafted assets, highlighting their potential for replacement. However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets always need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the meshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior to Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists. Specifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore geometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and lower representation quality. To address these issues, we introduce MeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem, producing AMs aligned with specified shapes. By converting 3D assets in any 3D representation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset production methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry. The architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE, then train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary for shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments show that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces, significantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while achieving precision comparable to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Super(ficial)-alignment: Strong Models May Deceive Weak Models in Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superalignment, where humans act as weak supervisors for superhuman models, has become a crucial problem with the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work has preliminarily studied this problem by using weak models to supervise strong models, and discovered that weakly supervised strong students can consistently outperform weak teachers towards the alignment target, leading to a weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon. However, we are concerned that behind such a promising phenomenon, whether there exists an issue of weak-to-strong deception, where strong models deceive weak models by exhibiting well-aligned in areas known to weak models but producing misaligned behaviors in cases weak models do not know. We take an initial step towards exploring this security issue in a specific but realistic multi-objective alignment case, where there may be some alignment targets conflicting with each other (e.g., helpfulness v.s. harmlessness). We aim to explore whether, in such cases, strong models might deliberately make mistakes in areas known to them but unknown to weak models within one alignment dimension, in exchange for a higher reward in another dimension. Through extensive experiments in both the reward modeling and preference optimization scenarios, we find: (1) The weak-to-strong deception phenomenon exists across all settings. (2) The deception intensifies as the capability gap between weak and strong models increases. (3) Bootstrapping with an intermediate model can mitigate the deception to some extent, though its effectiveness remains limited. Our work highlights the urgent need to pay more attention to the true reliability of superalignment.</description>

      <title>UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models from Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex question-answering (QA) scenarios has always been a research focal point. Recent studies have attempted to enhance LLMs' performance by combining step-wise planning with external retrieval. While effective for advanced models like GPT-3.5, smaller LLMs face challenges in decomposing complex questions, necessitating supervised fine-tuning. Previous work has relied on manual annotation and knowledge distillation from teacher LLMs, which are time-consuming and not accurate enough. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing LLMs' planning capabilities by using planning data derived from knowledge graphs (KGs). LLMs fine-tuned with this data have improved planning capabilities, better equipping them to handle complex QA tasks that involve retrieval. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, highlight the effectiveness of our framework and the benefits of KG-derived planning data.</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation for Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interleaved text-and-image generation has been an intriguing research direction, where the models are required to generate both images and text pieces in an arbitrary order. Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation. We carefully define five essential evaluation aspects for InterleavedEval, including text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness, to ensure a comprehensive and fine-grained assessment. Through extensive experiments and rigorous human evaluation, we show that our benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate the existing models with a strong correlation with human judgments surpassing previous reference-based metrics. We also provide substantial findings and insights to foster future research in interleaved generation and its evaluation.</description>

      <title>Shortcomings of LLMs for Low-Resource Translation: Retrieval and Understanding are Both the Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the in-context learning abilities of pretrained large language models (LLMs) when instructed to translate text from a low-resource language into a high-resource language as part of an automated machine translation pipeline. We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of context retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of context type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</description>

      <title>RuleR: Improving LLM Controllability by Rule-based Data Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancement of Large language models (LLMs), they still lack delicate controllability under sophisticated constraints, which is critical to enhancing their response quality and the user experience. While conditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can potentially improve LLM controllability, curating new SFT data to fulfill the constraints usually relies on human experts or proprietary LLMs, which is time-consuming and expensive. To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a human/LLM-free data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original SFT data. Instead of creating new responses from scratch, RuleR integrates linguistic or formatting rules into the original instructions and modifies the responses to fulfill the rule-defined constraints. Training on the "recycled" data consolidates LLMs capability to generate constrained outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate RuleR's effectiveness in improving LLM controllability while maintaining general instruction-following performance. RuleR's code is released on https://github.com/tianyi-lab/RuleR.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Quality of Hallucination Benchmarks for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress and outstanding performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in recent years, LVLMs have been plagued by the issue of hallucination, i.e., LVLMs tend to generate responses that are inconsistent with the corresponding visual inputs. To evaluate the degree of hallucination in LVLMs, previous works have proposed a series of benchmarks featuring different types of tasks and evaluation metrics. However, we find that the quality of the existing hallucination benchmarks varies, with some suffering from problems, e.g., inconsistent evaluation results under repeated tests, and misalignment with human evaluation. To this end, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages various indicators to assess the reliability and validity of existing hallucination benchmarks separately. Specifically, for reliability we explore test-retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability, while for validity we examine criterion validity and coverage of hallucination types. Furthermore, based on the results of our quality measurement, we construct a High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark (HQH) for LVLMs, which demonstrates superior reliability and validity under our HQM framework. We conduct an extensive evaluation of over 10 representative LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, to provide an in-depth analysis of the hallucination issues in existing models. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/HQHBench/HQHBench.</description>

Abstract: Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input-that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks-the expected value of loss functions-by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods.</description>

      <title>Combining Automated Optimisation of Hyperparameters and Reward Shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been significant progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) in recent years. Nevertheless, finding suitable hyperparameter configurations and reward functions remains challenging even for experts, and performance heavily relies on these design choices. Also, most RL research is conducted on known benchmarks where knowledge about these choices already exists. However, novel practical applications often pose complex tasks for which no prior knowledge about good hyperparameters and reward functions is available, thus necessitating their derivation from scratch. Prior work has examined automatically tuning either hyperparameters or reward functions individually. We demonstrate empirically that an RL algorithm's hyperparameter configurations and reward function are often mutually dependent, meaning neither can be fully optimised without appropriate values for the other. We then propose a methodology for the combined optimisation of hyperparameters and the reward function. Furthermore, we include a variance penalty as an optimisation objective to improve the stability of learned policies. We conducted extensive experiments using Proximal Policy Optimisation and Soft Actor-Critic on four environments. Our results show that combined optimisation significantly improves over baseline performance in half of the environments and achieves competitive performance in the others, with only a minor increase in computational costs. This suggests that combined optimisation should be best practice.</description>

      <title>Learning to Correct for QA Reasoning with Black-box LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open challenge in recent machine learning is about how to improve the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in a black-box setting, i.e., without access to detailed information such as output token probabilities. Existing approaches either rely on accessibility (which is often unrealistic) or involve significantly increased train- and inference-time costs. This paper addresses those limitations or shortcomings by proposing a novel approach, namely CoBB (Correct for improving QA reasoning of Black-Box LLMs). It uses a trained adaptation model to perform a seq2seq mapping from the often-imperfect reasonings of the original black-box LLM to the correct or improved reasonings. Specifically, the adaptation model is initialized with a relatively small open-source LLM and adapted over a collection of sub-sampled training pairs. To select the representative pairs of correct and incorrect reasonings, we formulated the dataset construction as an optimization problem that minimizes the statistical divergence between the sampled subset and the entire collection, and solved it via a genetic algorithm. We then train the adaptation model over the sampled pairs by contrasting the likelihoods of correct and incorrect reasonings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoBB significantly improves reasoning accuracy across various QA benchmarks, compared to the best-performing adaptation baselines.</description>

      <title>Detecting Subtle Differences between Human and Model Languages Using Spectrum of Relative Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human and model-generated texts can be distinguished by examining the magnitude of likelihood in language. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult as language model's capabilities of generating human-like texts keep evolving. This study provides a new perspective by using the relative likelihood values instead of absolute ones, and extracting useful features from the spectrum-view of likelihood for the human-model text detection task. We propose a detection procedure with two classification methods, supervised and heuristic-based, respectively, which results in competitive performances with previous zero-shot detection methods and a new state-of-the-art on short-text detection. Our method can also reveal subtle differences between human and model languages, which find theoretical roots in psycholinguistics studies.

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Sparse Geometric MPNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that such models can separate \emph{generic} pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs, though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However, these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application, every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.
  This paper shows that generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs can be separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, $\us$, which achieves our theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on synthetic and chemical benchmarks.

      <title>Combining AI Control Systems and Human Decision Support via Robustness and Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world, yet do not always make correct or safe decisions. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.</description>

      <title>MMSci: A Dataset for Graduate-Level Multi-Discipline Multimodal Scientific Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is making AI-driven scientific assistants increasingly feasible, with interpreting scientific figures being a crucial task. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus mainly on basic charts and limited science subjects, lacking comprehensive evaluations. To address this, we curated a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from peer-reviewed, open-access Nature Communications articles, spanning 72 scientific disciplines. This dataset includes figures such as schematic diagrams, simulated images, macroscopic/microscopic photos, and experimental visualizations (e.g., western blots), which often require graduate-level, discipline-specific expertise to interpret. We developed benchmarks for scientific figure captioning and multiple-choice questions, evaluating six proprietary and over ten open-source models across varied settings. The results highlight the high difficulty of these tasks and the significant performance gap among models. While many open-source models performed at chance level on the multiple-choice task, some matched the performance of proprietary models. However, the gap was more pronounced in the captioning task. Our dataset also provide valuable resource for training. Fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL-2B model with our task-specific multimodal training data improved its multiple-choice accuracy to a level comparable to GPT-4o, though captioning remains challenging. Continuous pre-training of MLLMs using our interleaved article and figure data enhanced their material generation capabilities, demonstrating potential for integrating scientific knowledge. The dataset and benchmarks will be released to support further research.</description>

      <title>Greener GRASS: Enhancing GNNs with Encoding, Rewiring, and Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.</description>

      <title>Generative Image as Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-generation diffusion models have been fine-tuned to unlock new capabilities such as image-editing and novel view synthesis. Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.</description>

      <title>Think-on-Graph 2.0: Deep and Faithful Large Language Model Reasoning with Knowledge-guided Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10805v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models (LLMs) by using knowledge retrieval to address knowledge gaps. However, existing RAG approaches often fail to ensure the depth and completeness of the information retrieved, which is essential for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we present Think-on-Graph 2.0 (ToG-2), a hybrid RAG framework that iteratively retrieves information from both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in a tightly integrated manner. Specifically, ToG-2 leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to connect documents via entities, facilitating deep and knowledge-guided context retrieval. Simultaneously, it uses documents as entity contexts to enable precise and efficient graph retrieval.
  ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate accurate answers. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the following advantages of ToG-2: (1) ToG-2 tightly integrates context retrieval and graph retrieval, enhancing context retrieval through the KG while enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; (2) it achieves deep and faithful reasoning in LLMs through an iterative knowledge retrieval process that integrates contexts and the KG; and (3) ToG-2 is training-free and compatible with various LLMs as a plug-and-play solution. Extensive experiments show that ToG-2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 6 out of 7 knowledge-intensive datasets with GPT-3.5, and can elevate the performance of smaller models (e.g., LLAMA-2-13B) to the level of GPT-3.5's direct reasoning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Correctness: Benchmarking Multi-dimensional Code Generation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous benchmarks to evaluate the impressive coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks primarily assess the accuracy of LLM-generated code, while neglecting other critical dimensions that also significantly impact code quality in real-world development. Moreover, relying exclusively on correctness as the guiding metric renders LLMs susceptible to data contamination. Therefore, this paper proposes the RACE benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates the quality of code generated by LLMs across 4 dimensions: Readability, mAintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency. Specifically, considering the demand-dependent nature of dimensions beyond correctness, we design various types of user requirements for each dimension to assess the model's ability to generate correct code that also meets user demands. We analyze 28 representative LLMs based on RACE and find that: 1) current correctness-centric benchmarks fail to capture the multifaceted requirements of code in real-world scenarios, while RACE provides a comprehensive evaluation that reveals the defects of LLMs across multiple dimensions; 2) the RACE benchmark serves as an effective tool for resisting the risk of data contamination; 3) even the most advanced code LLMs still encounter significant challenges in customized requirements involving complex instructions; 4) most LLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style. These findings highlight the need for a multidimensional evaluation of code LLMs, emphasizing metrics beyond correctness for real-world applications. Future efforts should aim to develop novel learning algorithms to enhance code generation under varied constraints and improve coverage and usability for diverse user needs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study extensively evaluated You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithms across all configurations (total 22) of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLO11 for green fruit detection in commercial orchards. The research also validated in-field fruitlet counting using an iPhone and machine vision sensors across four apple varieties: Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp and Cosmic Crisp. Among the 22 configurations evaluated, YOLO11s and YOLOv9 gelan-base outperformed others with mAP@50 scores of 0.933 and 0.935 respectively. In terms of recall, YOLOv9 gelan-base achieved the highest value among YOLOv9 configurations at 0.899, while YOLO11m led YOLO11 variants with 0.897. YOLO11n emerged as the fastest model, achieving fastest inference speed of only 2.4 ms, significantly outpacing the leading configurations of YOLOv10n, YOLOv9 gelan-s, and YOLOv8n, with speeds of 5.5, 11.5, and 4.1 ms, respectively. This comparative evaluation highlights the strengths of YOLO11, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10, offering researchers essential insights to choose the best-suited model for fruitlet detection and possible automation in commercial orchards. For real-time automation related work in relevant datasets, we recommend using YOLO11n due to its high detection and image processing speed.

      <title>GPT-4V Cannot Generate Radiology Reports Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPT-4V's purported strong multimodal abilities raise interests in using it to automate radiology report writing, but there lacks thorough evaluations. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V in generating radiology reports on two chest X-ray report datasets: MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. We attempt to directly generate reports using GPT-4V through different prompting strategies and find that it fails terribly in both lexical metrics and clinical efficacy metrics. To understand the low performance, we decompose the task into two steps: 1) the medical image reasoning step of predicting medical condition labels from images; and 2) the report synthesis step of generating reports from (groundtruth) conditions. We show that GPT-4V's performance in image reasoning is consistently low across different prompts. In fact, the distributions of model-predicted labels remain constant regardless of which groundtruth conditions are present on the image, suggesting that the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully. Even when given groundtruth conditions in report synthesis, its generated reports are less correct and less natural-sounding than a finetuned LLaMA-2. Altogether, our findings cast doubt on the viability of using GPT-4V in a radiology workflow.</description>

      <title>Spectra: A Comprehensive Study of Ternary, Quantized, and FP16 Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in GPU computational power has outpaced memory capacity and bandwidth growth, creating bottlenecks in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the feasibility and scalability of low-bitwidth language models, paving the way for the development of more efficient LLMs.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at \href{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.</description>

      <title>MetaTool: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master Tools with Meta-task Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for grounding AI agents in real-world applications. The prevailing approach involves few-shot prompting with demonstrations or fine-tuning with expert annotations. However, mere in-context demonstrations may fail to cover sufficient knowledge for complex tools and tasks. Training on solution paths is also hindered by the high cost of expert annotations and generalizing to new tools. A core challenge of generalizable tool use lies in understanding the "meta", or fundamental natures of tools that are transferable across tasks, such as causality and constraints. In this paper, we present MetaTool, a novel tool learning methodology designed to generalize across any reusable toolset. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised augmentation technique derived from a series of meta-tasks. This involves predicting masked elements in the tool execution process. The self-supervised procedure enables scalable generation of high-quality QA data, which is handy for supervising tool understanding. By incorporating meta-task data into task-oriented training, our method significantly enhances the performance of open-source LLMs, achieving results comparable to ChatGPT in both tool-based planning and chatting scenarios. Through large-scale instruction tuning, the MetaTool model demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalizability on new tasks.</description>

      <title>ReFeR: Improving Evaluation and Reasoning through Hierarchy of Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the quality of outputs generated by generative models, such as large language models and vision language models, presents notable challenges. Traditional methods for evaluation typically rely on either human assessments, which are resource-intensive, or automatic metrics that often show a low correlation with human judgment. Another common approach is to use deep learning systems, which not only consume a substantial amount of compute and time but also require extensive training data. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework called ReFeR, designed to evaluate generative outputs, including both text and images, by leveraging a 2-level hierarchy of LLMs and VLMs themselves. We rigorously evaluate our framework, ReFeR, across four diverse evaluation tasks. The framework not only improves the accuracy of these evaluations, surpassing previous benchmarks but also generates constructive feedback. Interestingly, the framework is also applicable to reasoning tasks. Experiments on four reasoning tasks demonstrate superior collective reasoning abilities of the framework. We present two variants of the framework: ReFeR-Turbo, optimized for accelerated performance, and ReFeR-Lite, offering a more cost-effective solution. ReFeR-Lite is $\sim7.7\times$ more efficient while being comparably accurate to ReFeR-Turbo. We make code, data and PIP package publicly available.

      <title>Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the development of sophisticated models trained on extensive datasets, yet raising concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based unlearning techniques. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods require access to the original training data, which is often inaccessible. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bear the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to remove specific knowledge through an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically assess the unlearning extent on specific data pieces and make iterative update. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Photonic Reservoir Computing: Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Parallel Computing with a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</description>

      <title>ReLiK: Retrieve and LinK, Fast and Accurate Entity Linking and Relation Extraction on an Academic Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) and Relation Extraction (RE) are fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing, serving as critical components in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ReLiK, a Retriever-Reader architecture for both EL and RE, where, given an input text, the Retriever module undertakes the identification of candidate entities or relations that could potentially appear within the text. Subsequently, the Reader module is tasked to discern the pertinent retrieved entities or relations and establish their alignment with the corresponding textual spans. Notably, we put forward an innovative input representation that incorporates the candidate entities or relations alongside the text, making it possible to link entities or extract relations in a single forward pass and to fully leverage pre-trained language models contextualization capabilities, in contrast with previous Retriever-Reader-based methods, which require a forward pass for each candidate. Our formulation of EL and RE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks while using academic budget training and with up to 40x inference speed compared to competitors. Finally, we show how our architecture can be used seamlessly for Information Extraction (cIE), i.e. EL + RE, and setting a new state of the art by employing a shared Reader that simultaneously extracts entities and relations.</description>

      <title>Self-Introspective Decoding: Alleviating Hallucinations for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as a significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</description>

      <title>Progressively Label Enhancement for Large Language Model Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) alignment aims to prevent models from producing content that misaligns with human expectations, which can lead to ethical and legal concerns. In the last few years, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the most prominent method for achieving alignment. Due to challenges in stability and scalability with RLHF stages, which arise from the complex interactions between multiple models, researchers are exploring alternative methods to achieve effects comparable to those of RLHF. However, these methods often rely on large high-quality datasets. Despite some methods considering the generation of additional data to expand datasets, they often treat model training and data generation as separate and static processes, overlooking the fact that these processes are highly interdependent, leading to inefficient utilization of the generated data. To deal with this problem, we propose PLE, i.e., Progressively Label Enhancement for LLM Alignment, a framework that dynamically adjusts the model's training process based on the evolving quality of the generated data. Specifically, we prompt the model to generate responses for both the original query and the query guided by a set of carefully designed principles, and then utilize a dynamic threshold to determine the appropriate training approach for both responses based on their corresponding reward scores. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PLE compared to existing LLM alignment methods.</description>

      <title>Is Child-Directed Speech Effective Training Data for Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While high-performing language models are typically trained on hundreds of billions of words, human children become fluent language users with a much smaller amount of data. What are the features of the data they receive, and how do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this question, we train GPT-2 and RoBERTa models on 29M words of English child-directed speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, and a heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children's training data supports high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not uniquely valuable for training language models. These findings support the hypothesis that, rather than proceeding from better data, the child's learning algorithm is substantially more data-efficient than current language modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Training Overhead Ratio: A Practical Reliability Metric for Large Language Model Training Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the AI industry with their superior capabilities. Training these models requires large-scale GPU clusters and significant computing time, leading to frequent failures that significantly increase training costs. Despite its significance, this field lacks a metric for evaluating reliability. In this work, we introduce a novel reliability metric called \emph{Training Overhead Ratio} (TOR) to evaluate the reliability of fault-tolerant LLM training systems. TOR is defined as the ratio of optimal training time to the observed training time of a system, serving as a practical tool for users to estimate the actual time required to train an LLM on a given system. Furthermore, our investigation identifies the key factor for enhancing reliability and present TOR equations for various types of failures encountered in practice.</description>

      <title>Staircase Cascaded Fusion of Lightweight Local Pattern Recognition and Long-Range Dependencies for Structural Crack Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, as existing methods struggle to effectively integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods often possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge control devices. In this paper, we propose a staircase cascaded fusion crack segmentation network (CrackSCF) that generates high-quality crack segmentation maps using minimal computational resources. We constructed a staircase cascaded fusion module that effectively captures local patterns of cracks and long-range dependencies of pixels, and it can suppress background noise well. To reduce the computational resources required by the model, we introduced a lightweight convolution block, which replaces all convolution operations in the network, significantly reducing the required computation and parameters without affecting the network's performance. To evaluate our method, we created a challenging benchmark dataset called TUT and conducted experiments on this dataset and five other public datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method offers significant advantages over existing methods, especially in handling background noise interference and detailed crack segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring the least computational resources. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/Karl1109/CrackSCF.</description>

      <title>RoCP-GNN: Robust Conformal Prediction for Graph Neural Networks in Node-Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting outcomes in graph-structured data. However, a notable limitation of GNNs is their inability to provide robust uncertainty estimates, which undermines their reliability in contexts where errors are costly. One way to address this issue is by providing prediction sets that contain the true label with a predefined probability margin. Our approach builds upon conformal prediction (CP), a framework that promises to construct statistically robust prediction sets or intervals. There are two primary challenges: first, given dependent data like graphs, it is unclear whether the critical assumption in CP - exchangeability - still holds when applied to node classification. Second, even if the exchangeability assumption is valid for conformalized link prediction, we need to ensure high efficiency, i.e., the resulting prediction set or the interval length is small enough to provide useful information. In this article, we propose a novel approach termed Robust Conformal Prediction for GNNs (RoCP-GNN), which integrates conformal prediction (CP) directly into the GNN training process. This method generates prediction sets, instead of just point predictions, that are valid at a user-defined confidence level, assuming only exchangeability. Our approach robustly predicts outcomes with any predictive GNN model while quantifying the uncertainty in predictions within the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Experimental results demonstrate that GNN models with size loss provide a statistically significant increase in performance. We validate our approach on standard graph benchmark datasets by coupling it with various state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification. The code will be made available after publication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>

      <title>Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners.</description>

      <title>TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first \textbf{T}ransfer-based \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{S}keletal \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}ecognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Can Your Generative Model Detect Out-of-Distribution Covariate Shift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) sensory data and covariate distribution shift aims to identify new test examples with different high-level image statistics to the captured, normal and In-Distribution (ID) set. Existing OOD detection literature largely focuses on semantic shift with little-to-no consensus over covariate shift. Generative models capture the ID data in an unsupervised manner, enabling them to effectively identify samples that deviate significantly from this learned distribution, irrespective of the downstream task. In this work, we elucidate the ability of generative models to detect and quantify domain-specific covariate shift through extensive analyses that involves a variety of models. To this end, we conjecture that it is sufficient to detect most occurring sensory faults (anomalies and deviations in global signals statistics) by solely modeling high-frequency signal-dependent and independent details. We propose a novel method, CovariateFlow, for OOD detection, specifically tailored to covariate heteroscedastic high-frequency image-components using conditional Normalizing Flows (cNFs). Our results on CIFAR10 vs. CIFAR10-C and ImageNet200 vs. ImageNet200-C demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by accurately detecting OOD covariate shift. This work contributes to enhancing the fidelity of imaging systems and aiding machine learning models in OOD detection in the presence of covariate shift.</description>

      <title>Training quantum machine learning models on cloud without uploading the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the linearity of quantum unitary operations, we propose a method that runs the parameterized quantum circuits before encoding the input data. This enables a dataset owner to train machine learning models on quantum cloud computation platforms, without the risk of leaking the information about the data. It is also capable of encoding a vast amount of data effectively at a later time using classical computations, thus saving runtime on quantum computation devices. The trained quantum machine learning models can be run completely on classical computers, meaning the dataset owner does not need to have any quantum hardware, nor even quantum simulators. Moreover, our method mitigates the encoding bottleneck by reducing the required circuit depth from $O(2^{n})$ to $O(n)$, and relax the tolerance on the precision of the quantum gates for the encoding. These results demonstrate yet another advantage of quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning models over existing classical neural networks, and broaden the approaches to data security.</description>

      <title>QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of alpha factor mining is to discover indicative signals of investment opportunities from the historical financial market data of assets, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining, making it ineffective to explore the search space of the formula. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. Given that the underlying state transition function adheres to the Dirac distribution, the Markov Decision Process within this framework exhibit minimal environmental variability, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Experimental evaluations on various real assets data show that the proposed algorithm can increase the correlation with asset returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</description>

      <title>TriplePlay: Enhancing Federated Learning with CLIP for Non-IID Data and Resource Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and increasing complexity of pretrained models, exemplified by CLIP, offer significant opportunities as well as challenges for Federated Learning (FL), a critical component of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence. This research delves into the intricacies of integrating large foundation models like CLIP within FL frameworks to enhance privacy, efficiency, and adaptability across heterogeneous data landscapes. It specifically addresses the challenges posed by non-IID data distributions, the computational and communication overheads of leveraging such complex models, and the skewed representation of classes within datasets. We propose TriplePlay, a framework that integrates CLIP as an adapter to enhance FL's adaptability and performance across diverse data distributions. This approach addresses the long-tail distribution challenge to ensure fairness while reducing resource demands through quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques.Our simulation results demonstrate that TriplePlay effectively decreases GPU usage costs and speeds up the learning process, achieving convergence with reduced communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Bridges for Unsupervised Musical Audio Timbre Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</description>

      <title>Federated Impression for Learning with Distributed Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard deep learning-based classification approaches may not always be practical in real-world clinical applications, as they require a centralized collection of all samples. Federated learning (FL) provides a paradigm that can learn from distributed datasets across clients without requiring them to share data, which can help mitigate privacy and data ownership issues. In FL, sub-optimal convergence caused by data heterogeneity is common among data from different health centers due to the variety in data collection protocols and patient demographics across centers. Through experimentation in this study, we show that data heterogeneity leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting during local training. We propose FedImpres which alleviates catastrophic forgetting by restoring synthetic data that represents the global information as federated impression. To achieve this, we distill the global model resulting from each communication round. Subsequently, we use the synthetic data alongside the local data to enhance the generalization of local training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the BloodMNIST and Retina datasets, which contain label imbalance and domain shift, with an improvement in classification accuracy of up to 20%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small and medium-sized agricultural holders face challenges like limited access to localized, timely information, impacting productivity and sustainability. Traditional extension services, which rely on in-person agents, struggle with scalability and timely delivery, especially in remote areas. We introduce FarmerChat, a generative AI-powered chatbot designed to address these issues. Leveraging Generative AI, FarmerChat offers personalized, reliable, and contextually relevant advice, overcoming limitations of previous chatbots in deterministic dialogue flows, language support, and unstructured data processing. Deployed in four countries, FarmerChat has engaged over 15,000 farmers and answered over 300,000 queries. This paper highlights how FarmerChat's innovative use of GenAI enhances agricultural service scalability and effectiveness. Our evaluation, combining quantitative analysis and qualitative insights, highlights FarmerChat's effectiveness in improving farming practices, enhancing trust, response quality, and user engagement.</description>

      <title>LACOSTE: Exploiting stereo and temporal contexts for surgical instrument segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Hi-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Hi-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hi-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</description>

      <title>FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</description>

      <title>The FIX Benchmark: Extracting Features Interpretable to eXperts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</description>

      <title>Transforming Multidimensional Time Series into Interpretable Event Sequences for Advanced Data Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel spatiotemporal feature representation model designed to address the limitations of traditional methods in multidimensional time series (MTS) analysis. The proposed approach converts MTS into one-dimensional sequences of spatially evolving events, preserving the complex coupling relationships between dimensions. By employing a variable-length tuple mining method, key spatiotemporal features are extracted, enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of time series analysis. Unlike conventional models, this unsupervised method does not rely on large training datasets, making it adaptable across different domains. Experimental results from motion sequence classification validate the model's superior performance in capturing intricate patterns within the data. The proposed framework has significant potential for applications across various fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet businesses for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. This work offers a new theoretical foundation and technical support for advancing time series data mining and its practical applications in human behavior recognition and other domains.</description>

      <title>Effective and Evasive Fuzz Testing-Driven Jailbreaking Attacks against LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates, our method starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks.
  We evaluated our method on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, our method achieves attack success rates of over 90%,80% and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60%. Additionally, our method can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, our method can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, our method demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses. We will open-source our codes upon publication.</description>

      <title>Depression Diagnosis Dialogue Simulation: Self-improving Psychiatrist with Tertiary Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental health issues, particularly depressive disorders, present significant challenges in contemporary society, necessitating the development of effective automated diagnostic methods. This paper introduces the Agent Mental Clinic (AMC), a self-improving conversational agent system designed to enhance depression diagnosis through simulated dialogues between patient and psychiatrist agents. To enhance the dialogue quality and diagnosis accuracy, we design a psychiatrist agent consisting of a tertiary memory structure, a dialogue control and reflect plugin that acts as ``supervisor'' and a memory sampling module, fully leveraging the skills reflected by the psychiatrist agent, achieving great accuracy on depression risk and suicide risk diagnosis via conversation. Experiment results on datasets collected in real-life scenarios demonstrate that the system, simulating the procedure of training psychiatrists, can be a promising optimization method for aligning LLMs with real-life distribution in specific domains without modifying the weights of LLMs, even when only a few representative labeled cases are available.</description>

      <title>The BRAVO Semantic Segmentation Challenge Results in UNCV2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the unified BRAVO challenge to benchmark the reliability of semantic segmentation models under realistic perturbations and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We define two categories of reliability: (1) semantic reliability, which reflects the model's accuracy and calibration when exposed to various perturbations; and (2) OOD reliability, which measures the model's ability to detect object classes that are unknown during training. The challenge attracted nearly 100 submissions from international teams representing notable research institutions. The results reveal interesting insights into the importance of large-scale pre-training and minimal architectural design in developing robust and reliable semantic segmentation models.</description>

      <title>Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.</description>

      <title>AI Can Be Cognitively Biased: An Exploratory Study on Threshold Priming in LLM-Based Batch Relevance Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cognitive biases are systematic deviations in thinking that lead to irrational judgments and problematic decision-making, extensively studied across various fields. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown advanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their training data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive biases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on specific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various decision-making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs are influenced by the threshold priming effect in relevance judgments, a core task and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR) coummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli unconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment employed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection, and tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch lengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B. Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond.</description>

      <title>TA-Cleaner: A Fine-grained Text Alignment Backdoor Defense Strategy for Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Faithfulness and the Notion of Adversarial Sensitivity in NLP Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faithfulness is arguably the most critical metric to assess the reliability of explainable AI. In NLP, current methods for faithfulness evaluation are fraught with discrepancies and biases, often failing to capture the true reasoning of models. We introduce Adversarial Sensitivity as a novel approach to faithfulness evaluation, focusing on the explainer's response when the model is under adversarial attack. Our method accounts for the faithfulness of explainers by capturing sensitivity to adversarial input changes. This work addresses significant limitations in existing evaluation techniques, and furthermore, quantifies faithfulness from a crucial yet underexplored paradigm.</description>

      <title>Embodied-RAG: General Non-parametric Embodied Memory for Retrieval and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent works have focused on source-free UDA, where only target data is available. This is challenging as models rely on noisy pseudo-labels and struggle with distribution shifts. We propose Active Adversarial Alignment (A3), a novel framework combining self-supervised learning, adversarial training, and active learning for robust source-free UDA. A3 actively samples informative and diverse data using an acquisition function for training. It adapts models via adversarial losses and consistency regularization, aligning distributions without source data access. A3 advances source-free UDA through its synergistic integration of active and adversarial learning for effective domain alignment and noise reduction.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel family of adversarial attacks that exploit the inability of language models to interpret ASCII art. To evaluate these attacks, we propose the ToxASCII benchmark and develop two custom ASCII art fonts: one leveraging special tokens and another using text-filled letter shapes. Our attacks achieve a perfect 1.0 Attack Success Rate across ten models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and LLaMA 3.1.

      <description>arXiv:2409.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as coherence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach integrates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.</description>

Abstract: Multi-view egocentric hand tracking is a challenging task and plays a critical role in VR interaction. In this report, we present a method that uses multi-view input images and camera extrinsic parameters to estimate both hand shape and pose. To reduce overfitting to the camera layout, we apply crop jittering and extrinsic parameter noise augmentation. Additionally, we propose an offline neural smoothing post-processing method to further improve the accuracy of hand position and pose. Our method achieves 13.92mm MPJPE on the Umetrack dataset and 21.66mm MPJPE on the HOT3D dataset.</description>

      <title>DoPAMine: Domain-specific Pre-training Adaptation from seed-guided data Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generalize effectively across numerous industry domains while executing a range of tasks. Many of these competencies are obtained from the data utilized during the pre-training phase of the Language Models (LMs). However, these models exhibit limitations when tasked with performing in specialized or low-resource industry domains. More recent approaches use LLMs for generating domain-specific synthetic data but most often they lack in truthfulness and complexity. Alternatively, in cases where domain data is available like healthcare and finance most of the LMs are proprietary necessitating the need for a scalable method to curate real world industry specific pre-training data. In this work, we propose an automated and scalable framework - DoPAMine:Domain-specific Pre-training Adaptation from seed-guided data Mining, to mine domain specific training data from a large data corpus for domain adaptation of a LM. The framework leverages the parametric knowledge of a LLM to generate diverse and representative seed data tailored to a specific domain which is then used to mine real world data from a large data corpus like Common Crawl. We evaluated our framework's performance in the continual pre-training (CPT) setting by training two domain specific 7B parameter LMs in healthcare and finance with data mined via DoPAMine. Our experiments show that DoPAMine boosts the performance of pre-trained LLMs on average by 4.9% and 5.1% in zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on healthcare tasks from MMLU, MedQA, MedMCQA and PubMedQA datasets, and 2.9% and 6.7% for zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on finance tasks from FiQA-SA, FPB and Headlines datasets when compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV Cache Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.</description>

      <title>Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA.</description>

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositionality, the notion that the meaning of an expression is constructed from the meaning of its parts and syntactic rules, permits the infinite productivity of human language. For the first time, artificial language models (LMs) are able to match human performance in a number of compositional generalization tasks. However, much remains to be understood about the representational mechanisms underlying these abilities. We take a high-level geometric approach to this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimensionality of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' intrinsic dimensionality, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between linear and nonlinear dimensionality, showing that they respectively encode formal and semantic aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

      <title>DRUPI: Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains. *The code will be released after the paper is accepted.*</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Gaps Between Translation and Native Perception in Training for Multimodal, Multilingual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a scarcity of multilingual vision-language models that properly account for the perceptual differences that are reflected in image captions across languages and cultures. In this work, through a multimodal, multilingual retrieval case study, we quantify the existing lack of model flexibility. We empirically show performance gaps between training on captions that come from native German perception and captions that have been either machine-translated or human-translated from English into German. To address these gaps, we further propose and evaluate caption augmentation strategies. While we achieve mean recall improvements (+1.3), gaps still remain, indicating an open area of future work for the community.</description>

      <title>Post-edits Are Preferences Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) techniques are currently one of the state of the art techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on pairwise preference feedback from human annotators. However, in machine translation, this sort of feedback can be difficult to solicit. Additionally, Kreutzer et al. (2018) have shown that, for machine translation, pairwise preferences are less reliable than other forms of human feedback, such as 5-point ratings.
  We examine post-edits to see if they can be a source of reliable human preferences by construction. In PO, a human annotator is shown sequences $s_1$ and $s_2$ and asked for a preference judgment, %$s_1 &gt; s_2$; while for post-editing, editors create $s_1$ and know that it should be better than $s_2$. We attempt to use these implicit preferences for PO and show that it helps the model move towards post-edit-like hypotheses and away from machine translation-like hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that best results are obtained by pre-training the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on post-edits in order to promote post-edit-like hypotheses to the top output ranks.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>Visual Editing with LLM-based Tool Chaining: An Efficient Distillation Approach for Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical distillation approach to fine-tune LLMs for invoking tools in real-time applications. We focus on visual editing tasks; specifically, we modify images and videos by interpreting user stylistic requests, specified in natural language ("golden hour"), using an LLM to select the appropriate tools and their parameters to achieve the desired visual effect. We found that proprietary LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo show potential in this task, but their high cost and latency make them unsuitable for real-time applications. In our approach, we fine-tune a (smaller) student LLM with guidance from a (larger) teacher LLM and behavioral signals. We introduce offline metrics to evaluate student LLMs. Both online and offline experiments show that our student models manage to match the performance of our teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo), significantly reducing costs and latency. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning was improved by 25% in low-data regimes using augmentation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Overcome the Machine Penalty When Acting Fairly but Not When Acting Selfishly or Altruistically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social dilemmas where the collective and self-interests are at odds, people typically cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon termed the machine penalty. Overcoming this penalty is critical for successful human-machine collectives, yet current solutions often involve ethically-questionable tactics, like concealing machines' non-human nature. In this study, with 1,152 participants, we explore the possibility of closing this research question by using Large Language Models (LLMs), in scenarios where communication is possible between interacting parties. We design three types of LLMs: (i) Cooperative, aiming to assist its human associate; (ii) Selfish, focusing solely on maximizing its self-interest; and (iii) Fair, balancing its own and collective interest, while slightly prioritizing self-interest. Our findings reveal that, when interacting with humans, fair LLMs are able to induce cooperation levels comparable to those observed in human-human interactions, even when their non-human nature is fully disclosed. In contrast, selfish and cooperative LLMs fail to achieve this goal. Post-experiment analysis shows that all three types of LLMs succeed in forming mutual cooperation agreements with humans, yet only fair LLMs, which occasionally break their promises, are capable of instilling a perception among humans that cooperating with them is the social norm, and eliciting positive views on their trustworthiness, mindfulness, intelligence, and communication quality. Our findings suggest that for effective human-machine cooperation, bot manufacturers should avoid designing machines with mere rational decision-making or a sole focus on assisting humans. Instead, they should design machines capable of judiciously balancing their own interest and the interest of humans.</description>

      <title>FaithEval: Can Your Language Model Stay Faithful to Context, Even If "The Moon is Made of Marshmallows"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improved faithfulness.Project is available at: \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FaithEval}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities but struggle to provide personalized content due to their lack of individual user preference information. Existing methods, such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, fall short in capturing the complexity of human preferences, especially given the small, personal datasets individuals possess. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing small parameter models as preference agents to generate natural language rules that guide a larger, pre-trained model, enabling efficient personalization. Our method involves a small, local "steering wheel" model that directs the outputs of a much larger foundation model, producing content tailored to an individual's preferences while leveraging the extensive knowledge and capabilities of the large model. Importantly, this personalization is achieved without the need to fine-tune the large model. Experimental results on email and article datasets, demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms baseline personalization methods. By allowing foundation models to adapt to individual preferences in a data and compute-efficient manner, our approach paves the way for highly personalized language model applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Deeper Understanding of Transformer for Residential Non-intrusive Load Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) applications in recent years. Despite their success, existing studies have not thoroughly examined the impact of various hyper-parameters on model performance, which is crucial for advancing high-performing transformer models. In this work, a comprehensive series of experiments have been conducted to analyze the influence of these hyper-parameters in the context of residential NILM. This study delves into the effects of the number of hidden dimensions in the attention layer, the number of attention layers, the number of attention heads, and the dropout ratio on transformer performance. Furthermore, the role of the masking ratio has explored in BERT-style transformer training, providing a detailed investigation into its impact on NILM tasks. Based on these experiments, the optimal hyper-parameters have been selected and used them to train a transformer model, which surpasses the performance of existing models. The experimental findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing transformer architectures, aiming to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency in NILM applications. It is expected that this work will serve as a foundation for future research and development of more robust and capable transformer models for NILM.</description>

      <title>Beyond Forecasting: Compositional Time Series Reasoning for End-to-End Task Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, there has been substantial advances in time series models and benchmarks across various individual tasks, such as time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Meanwhile, compositional reasoning in time series is prevalent in real-world applications (e.g., decision-making and compositional question answering) and is in great demand. Unlike simple tasks that primarily focus on predictive accuracy, compositional reasoning emphasizes the synthesis of diverse information from both time series data and various domain knowledge, making it distinct and extremely more challenging. In this paper, we introduce Compositional Time Series Reasoning, a new task of handling intricate multistep reasoning tasks from time series data. Specifically, this new task focuses on various question instances requiring structural and compositional reasoning abilities on time series data, such as decision-making and compositional question answering. As an initial attempt to tackle this novel task, we developed TS-Reasoner, a program-aided approach that utilizes large language model (LLM) to decompose a complex task into steps of programs that leverage existing time series models and numerical subroutines. Unlike existing reasoning work which only calls off-the-shelf modules, TS-Reasoner allows for the creation of custom modules and provides greater flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge as well as user-specified constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive set of experiments. These promising results indicate potential opportunities in the new task of time series reasoning and highlight the need for further research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Graph Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has emerged as a compelling framework for extracting informative representations from graph-structured data without extensive reliance on labeled inputs. In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</description>

      <title>Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</description>

      <title>IV-Mixed Sampler: Leveraging Image Diffusion Models for Enhanced Video Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-step sampling mechanism, a key feature of visual diffusion models, has significant potential to replicate the success of OpenAI's Strawberry in enhancing performance by increasing the inference computational cost. Sufficient prior studies have demonstrated that correctly scaling up computation in the sampling process can successfully lead to improved generation quality, enhanced image editing, and compositional generalization. While there have been rapid advancements in developing inference-heavy algorithms for improved image generation, relatively little work has explored inference scaling laws in video diffusion models (VDMs). Furthermore, existing research shows only minimal performance gains that are perceptible to the naked eye. To address this, we design a novel training-free algorithm IV-Mixed Sampler that leverages the strengths of image diffusion models (IDMs) to assist VDMs surpass their current capabilities. The core of IV-Mixed Sampler is to use IDMs to significantly enhance the quality of each video frame and VDMs ensure the temporal coherence of the video during the sampling process. Our experiments have demonstrated that IV-Mixed Sampler achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks including UCF-101-FVD, MSR-VTT-FVD, Chronomagic-Bench-150, and Chronomagic-Bench-1649. For example, the open-source Animatediff with IV-Mixed Sampler reduces the UMT-FVD score from 275.2 to 228.6, closing to 223.1 from the closed-source Pika-2.0.</description>

      <title>LongGenBench: Long-context Generation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current long-context benchmarks primarily focus on retrieval-based tests, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to locate specific information within extensive input contexts, such as the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) benchmark. Long-context generation refers to the ability of a language model to generate coherent and contextually accurate text that spans across lengthy passages or documents. While recent studies show strong performance on NIAH and other retrieval-based long-context benchmarks, there is a significant lack of benchmarks for evaluating long-context generation capabilities. To bridge this gap and offer a comprehensive assessment, we introduce a synthetic benchmark, LongGenBench, which allows for flexible configurations of customized generation context lengths. LongGenBench advances beyond traditional benchmarks by redesigning the format of questions and necessitating that LLMs respond with a single, cohesive long-context answer. Upon extensive evaluation using LongGenBench, we observe that: (1) both API accessed and open source models exhibit performance degradation in long-context generation scenarios, ranging from 1.2% to 47.1%; (2) different series of LLMs exhibit varying trends of performance degradation, with the Gemini-1.5-Flash model showing the least degradation among API accessed models, and the Qwen2 series exhibiting the least degradation in LongGenBench among open source models.</description>

      <title>SONAR: A Synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this paper, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming to provide a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Jessegator/SONAR.</description>

      <title>GenSim: A General Social Simulation Platform with Large Language Model based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</description>

      <title>VideoGuide: Improving Video Diffusion Models without Training Through a Teacher's Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Suicide Detection on Social Media with Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts highlights the importance of early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, where users often share personal experiences and seek help, could be utilized to identify individuals at risk. However, the large volume of daily posts makes manual review impractical. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect suicidal content in text-based social media posts. We propose a novel method for generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by prompting LLMs, along with traditional classification fine-tuning techniques to enhance label accuracy. To create a strong suicide detection model, we develop an ensemble approach involving prompting with Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and using fine-tuned models such as Llama3-8B, Llama3.1-8B, and Gemma2-9B. We evaluate our approach on the dataset of the Suicide Ideation Detection on Social Media Challenge, a track of the IEEE Big Data 2024 Big Data Cup. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the impact of different models and fine-tuning strategies on detection performance. Experimental results show that the ensemble model significantly improves the detection accuracy, by 5% points compared with the individual models. It achieves a weight F1 score of 0.770 on the public test set, and 0.731 on the private test set, providing a promising solution for identifying suicidal content in social media. Our analysis shows that the choice of LLMs affects the prompting performance, with larger models providing better accuracy. Our code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/khanhvynguyen/Suicide_Detection_LLMs.</description>

      <title>FAMMA: A Benchmark for Financial Domain Multilingual Multimodal Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for financial multilingual multimodal question answering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in answering questions that require advanced financial knowledge and sophisticated reasoning. It includes 1,758 meticulously collected question-answer pairs from university textbooks and exams, spanning 8 major subfields in finance including corporate finance, asset management, and financial engineering. Some of the QA pairs are written in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. These questions are presented in a mixed format combining text and heterogeneous image types, such as charts, tables, and diagrams. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art MLLMs on our benchmark, and our analysis shows that FAMMA poses a significant challenge for these models. Even advanced systems like GPT-4o and Claude-35-Sonnet achieve only 42\% accuracy. Additionally, the open-source Qwen2-VL lags notably behind its proprietary counterparts. Lastly, we explore GPT o1-style reasoning chains to enhance the models' reasoning capabilities, which significantly improve error correction. Our FAMMA benchmark will facilitate future research to develop expert systems in financial QA. The leaderboard is available at https://famma-bench.github.io/famma/ .</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural Kernels (G-FuNK): Learning Solutions of Nonlinear Diffusive Parametric PDEs on Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting time-dependent dynamics of complex systems governed by non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters and domains is a challenging task motivated by applications across various fields. We introduce a novel family of neural operators based on our Graph Fourier Neural Kernels, designed to learn solution generators for nonlinear PDEs in which the highest-order term is diffusive, across multiple domains and parameters. G-FuNK combines components that are parameter- and domain-adapted with others that are not. The domain-adapted components are constructed using a weighted graph on the discretized domain, where the graph Laplacian approximates the highest-order diffusive term, ensuring boundary condition compliance and capturing the parameter and domain-specific behavior. Meanwhile, the learned components transfer across domains and parameters using our variant Fourier Neural Operators. This approach naturally embeds geometric and directional information, improving generalization to new test domains without need for retraining the network. To handle temporal dynamics, our method incorporates an integrated ODE solver to predict the evolution of the system. Experiments show G-FuNK's capability to accurately approximate heat, reaction diffusion, and cardiac electrophysiology equations across various geometries and anisotropic diffusivity fields. G-FuNK achieves low relative errors on unseen domains and fiber fields, significantly accelerating predictions compared to traditional finite-element solvers.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Generalization Ability of Spatiotemporal Model in Urban Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal neural networks have shown great promise in urban scenarios by effectively capturing temporal and spatial correlations. However, urban environments are constantly evolving, and current model evaluations are often limited to traffic scenarios and use data mainly collected only a few weeks after training period to evaluate model performance. The generalization ability of these models remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a Spatiotemporal Out-of-Distribution (ST-OOD) benchmark, which comprises six urban scenario: bike-sharing, 311 services, pedestrian counts, traffic speed, traffic flow, ride-hailing demand, and bike-sharing, each with in-distribution (same year) and out-of-distribution (next years) settings. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models and find that their performance degrades significantly in out-of-distribution settings, with most models performing even worse than a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings suggest that current leading methods tend to over-rely on parameters to overfit training data, which may lead to good performance on in-distribution data but often results in poor generalization. We also investigated whether dropout could mitigate the negative effects of overfitting. Our results showed that a slight dropout rate could significantly improve generalization performance on most datasets, with minimal impact on in-distribution performance. However, balancing in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance remains a challenging problem. We hope that the proposed benchmark will encourage further research on this critical issue.</description>

      <title>Representing the Under-Represented: Cultural and Core Capability Benchmarks for Developing Thai Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the need for robust evaluation frameworks that assess their core capabilities, such as reasoning, knowledge, and commonsense, leading to the inception of certain widely-used benchmark suites such as the H6 benchmark. However, these benchmark suites are primarily built for the English language, and there exists a lack thereof for under-represented languages, in terms of LLM development, such as Thai. On the other hand, developing LLMs for Thai should also include enhancing the cultural understanding as well as core capabilities. To address these dual challenge in Thai LLM research, we propose two key benchmarks: Thai-H6 and Thai Cultural and Linguistic Intelligence Benchmark (ThaiCLI). Through a thorough evaluation of various LLMs with multi-lingual capabilities, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed benchmarks and how they contribute to Thai LLM development. Furthermore, we will make both the datasets and evaluation code publicly available to encourage further research and development for Thai LLMs.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Approximating Redundant Computational Blocks in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn similar internal representations, both across different models and within their own layers. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities present new opportunities for designing more efficient architectures. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of these internal similarities across different layers in diverse neural architectures, showing that similarity patterns emerge independently of the datataset used. We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy, to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets.</description>

      <title>FreSh: Frequency Shifting for Accelerated Neural Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently gained attention as a powerful approach for continuously representing signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs are known to exhibit a low-frequency bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details accurately. This limitation is typically addressed by incorporating high-frequency input embeddings or specialized activation layers. In this work, we demonstrate that these embeddings and activations are often configured with hyperparameters that perform well on average but are suboptimal for specific input signals under consideration, necessitating a costly grid search to identify optimal settings. Our key observation is that the initial frequency spectrum of an untrained model's output correlates strongly with the model's eventual performance on a given target signal. Leveraging this insight, we propose frequency shifting (or FreSh), a method that selects embedding hyperparameters to align the frequency spectrum of the model's initial output with that of the target signal. We show that this simple initialization technique improves performance across various neural representation methods and tasks, achieving results comparable to extensive hyperparameter sweeps but with only marginal computational overhead compared to training a single model with default hyperparameters.</description>

Abstract: Preference Optimization (PO) has proven an effective step for aligning language models to human-desired behaviors. Current variants, following the offline Direct Preference Optimization objective, have focused on a strict setting where all tokens are contributing signals of KL divergence and rewards to the loss function. However, human preference is not affected by each word in a sequence equally but is often dependent on specific words or phrases, e.g. existence of toxic terms leads to non-preferred responses. Based on this observation, we argue that not all tokens should be weighted equally during PO and propose a flexible objective termed SparsePO, that aims to automatically learn to weight the KL divergence and reward corresponding to each token during PO training. We propose two different variants of weight-masks that can either be derived from the reference model itself or learned on the fly. Notably, our method induces sparsity in the learned masks, allowing the model to learn how to best weight reward and KL divergence contributions at the token level, learning an optimal level of mask sparsity. Extensive experiments on multiple domains, including sentiment control, dialogue, text summarization and text-to-code generation, illustrate that our approach assigns meaningful weights to tokens according to the target task, generates more responses with the desired preference and improves reasoning tasks by up to 2 percentage points compared to other token- and response-level PO methods.</description>

      <title>Last Iterate Convergence in Monotone Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05127</link>

Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) is a framework utilized to model and approximate the behavior of a large number of agents, and the computation of equilibria in MFG has been a subject of interest. Despite the proposal of methods to approximate the equilibria, algorithms where the sequence of updated policy converges to equilibrium, specifically those exhibiting last-iterate convergence, have been limited. We propose the use of a simple, proximal-point-type algorithm to compute equilibria for MFGs. Subsequently, we provide the first last-iterate convergence guarantee under the Lasry--Lions-type monotonicity condition. We further employ the Mirror Descent algorithm for the regularized MFG to efficiently approximate the update rules of the proximal point method for MFGs. We demonstrate that the algorithm can approximate with an accuracy of $\varepsilon$ after $\mathcal{O}({\log(1/\varepsilon)})$ iterations. This research offers a tractable approach for large-scale and large-population games.</description>

      <title>Beyond FVD: Enhanced Evaluation Metrics for Video Generation Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05203</link>

Abstract: The Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) is a widely adopted metric for evaluating video generation distribution quality. However, its effectiveness relies on critical assumptions. Our analysis reveals three significant limitations: (1) the non-Gaussianity of the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) feature space; (2) the insensitivity of I3D features to temporal distortions; (3) the impractical sample sizes required for reliable estimation. These findings undermine FVD's reliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video generation evaluation. After extensive analysis of a wide range of metrics and backbone architectures, we propose JEDi, the JEPA Embedding Distance, based on features derived from a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, measured using Maximum Mean Discrepancy with polynomial kernel. Our experiments on multiple open-source datasets show clear evidence that it is a superior alternative to the widely used FVD metric, requiring only 16% of the samples to reach its steady value, while increasing alignment with human evaluation by 34%, on average.</description>

      <title>CasiMedicos-Arg: A Medical Question Answering Dataset Annotated with Explanatory Argumentative Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05235</link>

Abstract: Explaining Artificial Intelligence (AI) decisions is a major challenge nowadays in AI, in particular when applied to sensitive scenarios like medicine and law. However, the need to explain the rationale behind decisions is a main issue also for human-based deliberation as it is important to justify \textit{why} a certain decision has been taken. Resident medical doctors for instance are required not only to provide a (possibly correct) diagnosis, but also to explain how they reached a certain conclusion. Developing new tools to aid residents to train their explanation skills is therefore a central objective of AI in education. In this paper, we follow this direction, and we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first multilingual dataset for Medical Question Answering where correct and incorrect diagnoses for a clinical case are enriched with a natural language explanation written by doctors. These explanations have been manually annotated with argument components (i.e., premise, claim) and argument relations (i.e., attack, support), resulting in the Multilingual CasiMedicos-Arg dataset which consists of 558 clinical cases in four languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian) with explanations, where we annotated 5021 claims, 2313 premises, 2431 support relations, and 1106 attack relations. We conclude by showing how competitive baselines perform over this challenging dataset for the argument mining task.</description>
