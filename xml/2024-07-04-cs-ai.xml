      <title>Fish-bone diagram of research issue: Gain a bird's-eye view on a specific research topic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novice researchers often face difficulties in understanding a multitude of academic papers and grasping the fundamentals of a new research field. To solve such problems, the knowledge graph supporting research survey is gradually being developed. Existing keyword-based knowledge graphs make it difficult for researchers to deeply understand abstract concepts. Meanwhile, novice researchers may find it difficult to use ChatGPT effectively for research surveys due to their limited understanding of the research field. Without the ability to ask proficient questions that align with key concepts, obtaining desired and accurate answers from this large language model (LLM) could be inefficient. This study aims to help novice researchers by providing a fish-bone diagram that includes causal relationships, offering an overview of the research topic. The diagram is constructed using the issue ontology from academic papers, and it offers a broad, highly generalized perspective of the research field, based on relevance and logical factors. Furthermore, we evaluate the strengths and improvable points of the fish-bone diagram derived from this study's development pattern, emphasizing its potential as a viable tool for supporting research survey.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Graphical Counterfactuals: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual thinking is a critical yet challenging topic for artificial intelligence to learn knowledge from data and ultimately improve their performances for new scenarios. Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning, an important faculty of human cognition with many practical applications, is one of the core commonsense skills that is not purely language-based and, for satisfying (as opposed to optimal) solutions, requires some minimum degree of planning. Existing benchmarks of Commonsense Spatial Reasoning (CSR) tend to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret text-based spatial descriptions rather than directly evaluate a plan produced by the LLM in response to a spatial reasoning scenario. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark called $\textbf{GRASP}$, which consists of 16,000 grid-based environments where the agent is tasked with an energy collection problem. These environments include 100 grid instances instantiated using each of the 160 different grid settings, involving five different energy distributions, two modes of agent starting position, and two distinct obstacle configurations, as well as three kinds of agent constraints. Using GRASP, we compare classic baseline approaches, such as random walk and greedy search methods, with advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. The experimental results indicate that even these advanced LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions.</description>

      <title>Sequential Manipulation Against Rank Aggregation: Theory and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank aggregation with pairwise comparisons is widely encountered in sociology, politics, economics, psychology, sports, etc . Given the enormous social impact and the consequent incentives, the potential adversary has a strong motivation to manipulate the ranking list. However, the ideal attack opportunity and the excessive adversarial capability cause the existing methods to be impractical. To fully explore the potential risks, we leverage an online attack on the vulnerable data collection process. Since it is independent of rank aggregation and lacks effective protection mechanisms, we disrupt the data collection process by fabricating pairwise comparisons without knowledge of the future data or the true distribution. From the game-theoretic perspective, the confrontation scenario between the online manipulator and the ranker who takes control of the original data source is formulated as a distributionally robust game that deals with the uncertainty of knowledge. Then we demonstrate that the equilibrium in the above game is potentially favorable to the adversary by analyzing the vulnerability of the sampling algorithms such as Bernoulli and reservoir methods. According to the above theoretical analysis, different sequential manipulation policies are proposed under a Bayesian decision framework and a large class of parametric pairwise comparison models. For attackers with complete knowledge, we establish the asymptotic optimality of the proposed policies. To increase the success rate of the sequential manipulation with incomplete knowledge, a distributionally robust estimator, which replaces the maximum likelihood estimation in a saddle point problem, provides a conservative data generation solution. Finally, the corroborating empirical evidence shows that the proposed method manipulates the results of rank aggregation methods in a sequential manner.</description>

      <title>Certainly Uncertain: A Benchmark and Metric for Multimodal Epistemic and Aleatoric Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to acknowledge the inevitable uncertainty in their knowledge and reasoning is a prerequisite for AI systems to be truly truthful and reliable. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of uncertainty specific to vision-language AI systems, distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (arising from a lack of information) and aleatoric uncertainty (due to inherent unpredictability), and further explore finer categories within. Based on this taxonomy, we synthesize a benchmark dataset, CertainlyUncertain, featuring 178K visual question answering (VQA) samples as contrastive pairs. This is achieved by 1) inpainting images to make previously answerable questions into unanswerable ones; and 2) using image captions to prompt large language models for both answerable and unanswerable questions. Additionally, we introduce a new metric confidence-weighted accuracy, that is well correlated with both accuracy and calibration error, to address the shortcomings of existing metrics.</description>

      <title>Simple Augmentations of Logical Rules for Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality and high-coverage rule sets are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion (NS-KGC) models, because they form the basis of all symbolic inferences. Recent literature builds neural models for generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they struggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple augmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive forms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent relations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune potentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five ruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently improve results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using rules without augmentations.</description>

      <title>Abstract Dialectical Frameworks are Boolean Networks (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialectical frameworks are a unifying model of formal argumentation, where argumentative relations between arguments are represented by assigning acceptance conditions to atomic arguments. Their generality allow them to cover a number of different approaches with varying forms of representing the argumentation structure. Boolean regulatory networks are used to model the dynamics of complex biological processes, taking into account the interactions of biological compounds, such as proteins or genes. These models have proven highly useful for comprehending such biological processes, allowing to reproduce known behaviour and testing new hypotheses and predictions in silico, for example in the context of new medical treatments. While both these approaches stem from entirely different communities, it turns out that there are striking similarities in their appearence. In this paper, we study the relation between these two formalisms revealing their communalities as well as their differences, and introducing a correspondence that allows to establish novel results for the individual formalisms.</description>

      <title>Research on Reliable and Safe Occupancy Grid Prediction in Underground Parking Lots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of advancing science and technology, autonomous vehicle technology has emerged as a focal point of intense scrutiny within the academic community. Nevertheless, the challenge persists in guaranteeing the safety and reliability of this technology when navigating intricate scenarios. While a substantial portion of autonomous driving research is dedicated to testing in open-air environments, such as urban roads and highways, where the myriad variables at play are meticulously examined, enclosed indoor spaces like underground parking lots have, to a significant extent, been overlooked in the scholarly discourse. This discrepancy highlights a gap in derstanding the unique challenges these confined settings pose for autonomous navigation systems.
  This study tackles indoor autonomous driving, particularly in overlooked spaces like underground parking lots. Using CARLA's simulation platform, a realistic parking model is created for data gathering. An occupancy grid network then processes this data to predict vehicle paths and obstacles, enhancing the system's perception in complex indoor environments. Ultimately, this strategy improves safety in autonomous parking operations. The paper meticulously evaluates the model's predictive capabilities, validating its efficacy in the context of underground parking. Our findings confirm that the proposed strategy successfully enhances autonomous vehicle performance in these complex indoor settings. It equips autonomous systems with improved adaptation to underground lots, reinforcing safety measures and dependability. This work paves the way for future advancements and applications by addressing the research shortfall concerning indoor parking environments, serving as a pivotal reference point.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Machine ethics:a systematic review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine ethics is the field that studies how ethical behaviour can be accomplished by autonomous systems. While there exist some systematic reviews aiming to consolidate the state of the art in machine ethics prior to 2020, these tend to not include work that uses reinforcement learning agents as entities whose ethical behaviour is to be achieved. The reason for this is that only in the last years we have witnessed an increase in machine ethics studies within reinforcement learning. We present here a systematic review of reinforcement learning for machine ethics and machine ethics within reinforcement learning. Additionally, we highlight trends in terms of ethics specifications, components and frameworks of reinforcement learning, and environments used to result in ethical behaviour. Our systematic review aims to consolidate the work in machine ethics and reinforcement learning thus completing the gap in the state of the art machine ethics landscape</description>

      <title>Belief sharing: a blessing or a curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When collaborating with multiple parties, communicating relevant information is of utmost importance to efficiently completing the tasks at hand. Under active inference, communication can be cast as sharing beliefs between free-energy minimizing agents, where one agent's beliefs get transformed into an observation modality for the other. However, the best approach for transforming beliefs into observations remains an open question. In this paper, we demonstrate that naively sharing posterior beliefs can give rise to the negative social dynamics of echo chambers and self-doubt. We propose an alternate belief sharing strategy which mitigates these issues.</description>

      <title>Free Energy in a Circumplex Model of Emotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous active inference accounts of emotion translate fluctuations in free energy to a sense of emotion, mainly focusing on valence. However, in affective science, emotions are often represented as multi-dimensional. In this paper, we propose to adopt a Circumplex Model of emotion by mapping emotions into a two-dimensional spectrum of valence and arousal. We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged in a search task. We show that the manipulation of priors and object presence results in commonsense variability in emotional states.</description>

      <title>LINGO-Space: Language-Conditioned Incremental Grounding for Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of spatially localizing composite instructions referring to space: space grounding. Compared to current instance grounding, space grounding is challenging due to the ill-posedness of identifying locations referred to by discrete expressions and the compositional ambiguity of referring expressions. Therefore, we propose a novel probabilistic space-grounding methodology (LINGO-Space) that accurately identifies a probabilistic distribution of space being referred to and incrementally updates it, given subsequent referring expressions leveraging configurable polar distributions. Our evaluations show that the estimation using polar distributions enables a robot to ground locations successfully through $20$ table-top manipulation benchmark tests. We also show that updating the distribution helps the grounding method accurately narrow the referring space. We finally demonstrate the robustness of the space grounding with simulated manipulation and real quadruped robot navigation tasks. Code and videos are available at https://lingo-space.github.io.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Party Multi-Network AI for Global Deployment of 6G Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple visions of 6G networks elicit Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a central, native element. When 6G systems are deployed at a large scale, end-to-end AI-based solutions will necessarily have to encompass both the radio and the fiber-optical domain. This paper introduces the Decentralized Multi-Party, Multi-Network AI (DMMAI) framework for integrating AI into 6G networks deployed at scale. DMMAI harmonizes AI-driven controls across diverse network platforms and thus facilitates networks that autonomously configure, monitor, and repair themselves. This is particularly crucial at the network edge, where advanced applications meet heightened functionality and security demands. The radio/optical integration is vital due to the current compartmentalization of AI research within these domains, which lacks a comprehensive understanding of their interaction. Our approach explores multi-network orchestration and AI control integration, filling a critical gap in standardized frameworks for AI-driven coordination in 6G networks. The DMMAI framework is a step towards a global standard for AI in 6G, aiming to establish reference use cases, data and model management methods, and benchmarking platforms for future AI/ML solutions.</description>

      <title>In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary. Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard the Mental Wealth of nations.</description>

      <title>From Cognition to Computation: A Comparative Review of Human Attention and Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention is a cornerstone of human cognition that facilitates the efficient extraction of information in everyday life. Recent developments in artificial intelligence like the Transformer architecture also incorporate the idea of attention in model designs. However, despite the shared fundamental principle of selectively attending to information, human attention and the Transformer model display notable differences, particularly in their capacity constraints, attention pathways, and intentional mechanisms. Our review aims to provide a comparative analysis of these mechanisms from a cognitive-functional perspective, thereby shedding light on several open research questions. The exploration encourages interdisciplinary efforts to derive insights from human attention mechanisms in the pursuit of developing more generalized artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prompts in LLMs to Overcome Imbalances in Complex Educational Text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) with assertions to mitigate imbalances in educational datasets. Traditional models often fall short in such contexts, particularly due to the complexity and nuanced nature of the data. This issue is especially prominent in the education sector, where cognitive engagement levels among students show significant variation in their open responses. To test our hypothesis, we utilized an existing technology for assertion-based prompt engineering through an 'Iterative - ICL PE Design Process' comparing traditional Machine Learning (ML) models against LLMs augmented with assertions (N=135). Further, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on a subset (n=27), examining the variance in model performance concerning classification metrics and cognitive engagement levels in each iteration. Our findings reveal that LLMs with assertions significantly outperform traditional ML models, particularly in cognitive engagement levels with minority representation, registering up to a 32% increase in F1-score. Additionally, our sensitivity study indicates that incorporating targeted assertions into the LLM tested on the subset enhances its performance by 11.94%. This improvement primarily addresses errors stemming from the model's limitations in understanding context and resolving lexical ambiguities in student responses.</description>

      <title>Graphical user interface agents optimization for visual instruction grounding using multi-modal artificial intelligence systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most instance perception and image understanding solutions focus mainly on natural images. However, applications for synthetic images, and more specifically, images of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) remain limited. This hinders the development of autonomous computer-vision-powered Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. In this work, we present Search Instruction Coordinates or SIC, a multi-modal solution for object identification in a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a screenshot of a GUI, SIC locates the coordinates of the component on the screen where the instruction would be executed. To this end, we develop two methods. The first method is a three-part architecture that relies on a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and an object detection model. The second approach uses a multi-modal foundation model.</description>

      <title>3DMeshNet: A Three-Dimensional Differential Neural Network for Structured Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh generation is a crucial step in numerical simulations, significantly impacting simulation accuracy and efficiency. However, generating meshes remains time-consuming and requires expensive computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel method, 3DMeshNet, for three-dimensional structured mesh generation. The method embeds the meshing-related differential equations into the loss function of neural networks, formulating the meshing task as an unsupervised optimization problem. It takes geometric points as input to learn the potential mapping between parametric and computational domains. After suitable offline training, 3DMeshNet can efficiently output a three-dimensional structured mesh with a user-defined number of quadrilateral/hexahedral cells through the feed-forward neural prediction. To enhance training stability and accelerate convergence, we integrate loss function reweighting through weight adjustments and gradient projection alongside applying finite difference methods to streamline derivative computations in the loss. Experiments on different cases show that 3DMeshNet is robust and fast. It outperforms neural network-based methods and yields superior meshes compared to traditional mesh partitioning methods. 3DMeshNet significantly reduces training times by up to 85% compared to other neural network-based approaches and lowers meshing overhead by 4 to 8 times relative to traditional meshing methods.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data in Radiological Imaging: Current State and Future Outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in radiology is solving the associated data limitations. Obtaining sufficient and representative patient datasets with appropriate annotations may be burdensome due to high acquisition cost, safety limitations, patient privacy restrictions or low disease prevalence rates. In silico data offers a number of potential advantages to patient data, such as diminished patient harm, reduced cost, simplified data acquisition, scalability, improved quality assurance testing, and a mitigation approach to data imbalances. We summarize key research trends and practical uses for synthetically generated data for radiological applications of AI. Specifically, we discuss different types of techniques for generating synthetic examples, their main application areas, and related quality control assessment issues. We also discuss current approaches for evaluating synthetic imaging data. Overall, synthetic data holds great promise in addressing current data availability gaps, but additional work is needed before its full potential is realized.</description>

      <title>NaviSlim: Adaptive Context-Aware Navigation and Sensing via Dynamic Slimmable Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale autonomous airborne vehicles, such as micro-drones, are expected to be a central component of a broad spectrum of applications ranging from exploration to surveillance and delivery. This class of vehicles is characterized by severe constraints in computing power and energy reservoir, which impairs their ability to support the complex state-of-the-art neural models needed for autonomous operations. The main contribution of this paper is a new class of neural navigation models -- NaviSlim -- capable of adapting the amount of resources spent on computing and sensing in response to the current context (i.e., difficulty of the environment, current trajectory, and navigation goals). Specifically, NaviSlim is designed as a gated slimmable neural network architecture that, different from existing slimmable networks, can dynamically select a slimming factor to autonomously scale model complexity, which consequently optimizes execution time and energy consumption. Moreover, different from existing sensor fusion approaches, NaviSlim can dynamically select power levels of onboard sensors to autonomously reduce power and time spent during sensor acquisition, without the need to switch between different neural networks. By means of extensive training and testing on the robust simulation environment Microsoft AirSim, we evaluate our NaviSlim models on scenarios with varying difficulty and a test set that showed a dynamic reduced model complexity on average between 57-92%, and between 61-80% sensor utilization, as compared to static neural networks designed to match computing and sensing of that required by the most difficult scenario.</description>

      <title>Ego-Foresight: Agent Visuomotor Prediction as Regularization for RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) observed in the last decade, the amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies remains one of the primary concerns both in simulated and real environments. Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask. In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a very small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned. To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is that visuomotor prediction of the agent provides regularization to the RL algorithm, by encouraging the actions to stay within predictable bounds. To test our approach, we first study the ability of our model to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in real-world robotic interactions. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic manipulation tasks, showing an average improvement of 23% in efficiency and 8% in performance.</description>

Abstract: The advent of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is setting a new benchmark in the field of wireless communications. IRS, with their groundbreaking ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves, have opened avenues for substantial enhancements in signal quality, network efficiency, and spectral usage. These surfaces dynamically reconfigure the propagation environment, leading to optimized signal paths and reduced interference. Concurrently, UAVs have emerged as dynamic, versatile elements within communication networks, offering high mobility and the ability to access and enhance coverage in areas where traditional, fixed infrastructure falls short. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the synergistic integration of IRS and UAVs in wireless networks, highlighting how this innovative combination substantially boosts network performance, particularly in terms of security, energy efficiency, and reliability. The versatility of UAVs, combined with the signal-manipulating prowess of IRS, creates a potent solution for overcoming the limitations of conventional communication setups, especially in challenging and underserved environments. Furthermore, the survey delves into the cutting-edge realm of Machine Learning (ML), exploring its role in the strategic deployment and operational optimization of UAVs equipped with IRS. The paper also underscores the latest research and practical advancements in this field, providing insights into real-world applications and experimental setups. It concludes by discussing the future prospects and potential directions for this emerging technology, positioning the IRS-UAV integration as a transformative force in the landscape of next-generation wireless</description>

      <title>MOT: A Mixture of Actors Reinforcement Learning Method by Optimal Transport for Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic trading refers to executing buy and sell orders for specific assets based on automatically identified trading opportunities. Strategies based on reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing algorithmic trading problems. However, the trading patterns differ among market conditions due to shifted distribution data. Ignoring multiple patterns in the data will undermine the performance of RL. In this paper, we propose MOT,which designs multiple actors with disentangled representation learning to model the different patterns of the market. Furthermore, we incorporate the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm to allocate samples to the appropriate actor by introducing a regularization loss term. Additionally, we propose Pretrain Module to facilitate imitation learning by aligning the outputs of actors with expert strategy and better balance the exploration and exploitation of RL. Experimental results on real futures market data demonstrate that MOT exhibits excellent profit capabilities while balancing risks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the components of MOT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a use case of federated learning (FL) applied to discovering a maze with LiDAR sensors-equipped robots. Goal here is to train classification models to accurately identify the shapes of grid areas within two different square mazes made up with irregular shaped walls. Due to the use of different shapes for the walls, a classification model trained in one maze that captures its structure does not generalize for the other. This issue is resolved by adopting FL framework between the robots that explore only one maze so that the collective knowledge allows them to operate accurately in the unseen maze. This illustrates the effectiveness of FL in real-world applications in terms of enhancing classification accuracy and robustness in maze discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Prediction Accuracy Improvement of Data-Driven Medium-Range Global Weather Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term stability stands as a crucial requirement in data-driven medium-range global weather forecasting. Spectral bias is recognized as the primary contributor to instabilities, as data-driven methods difficult to learn small-scale dynamics. In this paper, we reveal that the universal mechanism for these instabilities is not only related to spectral bias but also to distortions brought by processing spherical data using conventional convolution. These distortions lead to a rapid amplification of errors over successive long-term iterations, resulting in a significant decline in forecast accuracy. To address this issue, a universal neural operator called the Spherical Harmonic Neural Operator (SHNO) is introduced to improve long-term iterative forecasts. SHNO uses the spherical harmonic basis to mitigate distortions for spherical data and uses gated residual spectral attention (GRSA) to correct spectral bias caused by spurious correlations across different scales. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method have been validated through its application for spherical Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) and medium-range global weather forecasting. Our findings highlight the benefits and potential of SHNO to improve the accuracy of long-term prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large models based on the Transformer architecture, researchers have observed an anomalous phenomenon in the Attention mechanism--there is a very high attention on the first element, which is prevalent across Transformer-based models. It is crucial to understand it for the development of techniques focusing on attention distribution, such as Key-Value (KV) Cache compression and infinite extrapolation; however, the latent cause leaves to be unknown. In this paper, we analyze such a phenomenon from the perspective of waiver phenomenon, which involves reducing the internal values of certain elements in the Softmax function, allowing them to absorb excess attention without affecting their contribution to information. In specific models, due to differences in positional encoding and attention patterns, we have found that the selection of waiver elements by the model can be categorized into two methods: positional-encoding-based and feature-distribution-within-elements-based.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful tool in chemistry across multiple domains. In chemistry, LLMs are able to accurately predict properties, design new molecules, optimize synthesis pathways, and accelerate drug and material discovery. A core emerging idea is combining LLMs with chemistry-specific tools like synthesis planners and databases, leading to so-called "agents." This review covers LLMs' recent history, current capabilities, design, challenges specific to chemistry, and future directions. Particular attention is given to agents and their emergence as a cross-chemistry paradigm. Agents have proven effective in diverse domains of chemistry, but challenges remain. It is unclear if creating domain-specific versus generalist agents and developing autonomous pipelines versus "co-pilot" systems will accelerate chemistry. An emerging direction is the development of multi-agent systems using a human-in-the-loop approach. Due to the incredibly fast development of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Deriva-ML: A Continuous FAIRness Approach to Reproducible Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are used in eScience applications [9]. While these approaches have great potential, the literature has shown that ML-based approaches frequently suffer from results that are either incorrect or unreproducible due to mismanagement or misuse of data used for training and validating the models [12, 15]. Recognition of the necessity of high-quality data for correct ML results has led to data-centric ML approaches that shift the central focus from model development to creation of high-quality data sets to train and validate the models [14, 20]. However, there are limited tools and methods available for data-centric approaches to explore and evaluate ML solutions for eScience problems which often require collaborative multidisciplinary teams working with models and data that will rapidly evolve as an investigation unfolds [1]. In this paper, we show how data management tools based on the principle that all of the data for ML should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (i.e. FAIR [26]) can significantly improve the quality of data that is used for ML applications. When combined with best practices that apply these tools to the entire life cycle of an ML-based eScience investigation, we can significantly improve the ability of an eScience team to create correct and reproducible ML solutions. We propose an architecture and implementation of such tools and demonstrate through two use cases how they can be used to improve ML-based eScience investigations.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive weights based on balanced residual decay rate for physics-informed neural networks and deep operator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative for solving partial differential equations. However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stability for Large Models Training in Constrained Bandwidth Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training extremely large language models with billions of parameters is a computationally intensive task that pushes the limits of current data parallel training systems. While techniques like ZeRO++ have enabled efficient distributed training of such giant models on inexpensive low-bandwidth clusters, they can suffer from convergence issues due to potential race conditions in the hierarchical partitioning (hpZ) scheme employed to reduce cross-machine communication. In this work, we first show how these race conditions cause instability when training models with billions of parameters. We then propose a modification to the partitioning algorithm that addresses these convergence challenges while maintaining competitive training efficiency. Empirical evaluation on training the multi-billion parameters Falcon Models and Llama-2 models demonstrates the updated algorithm's ability to achieve reliable convergence on these massive models, where stock ZeRO++ hpZ fails to converge. The updated algorithm enables robust training of larger models with 98\% throughput and model training speed improvement without sacrificing the quality of convergence.</description>

      <title>Edge-DIRECT: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Method for Solving Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to carbon-neutral policies in developed countries, electric vehicles route optimization has gained importance for logistics companies. With the increasing focus on customer expectations and the shift towards more customer-oriented business models, the integration of delivery time-windows has become essential in logistics operations. Recognizing the critical nature of these developments, this article studies the heterogeneous electric vehicle routing problem with time-window constraints (HEVRPTW). To solve this variant of vehicle routing problem (VRP), we propose a DRL-based approach, named Edge-enhanced Dual attentIon encoderR and feature-EnhanCed dual aTtention decoder (Edge-DIRECT). Edge-DIRECT features an extra graph representation, the node connectivity of which is based on the overlap of customer time-windows. Edge-DIRECT's self-attention encoding mechanism is enhanced by exploiting the energy consumption and travel time between the locations. To effectively account for the heterogeneity of the EVs' fleet, a dual attention decoder has been introduced. Experimental results based on two real-world datasets reveal that Edge-DIRECT outperforms a state-of-the-art DRL-based method and a well-established heuristic approach in solution quality and execution time. Furthermore, it exhibits competitive performance when compared to another leading heuristic method.</description>

      <title>TabSketchFM: Sketch-based Tabular Representation Learning for Data Discovery over Data Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprises have a growing need to identify relevant tables in data lakes; e.g. tables that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. Tabular neural models can be helpful for such data discovery tasks. In this paper, we present TabSketchFM, a neural tabular model for data discovery over data lakes. First, we propose a novel pre-training sketch-based approach to enhance the effectiveness of data discovery techniques in neural tabular models. Second, to further finetune the pretrained model for several downstream tasks, we develop LakeBench, a collection of 8 benchmarks to help with different data discovery tasks such as finding tasks that are unionable, joinable, or subsets of each other. We then show on these finetuning tasks that TabSketchFM achieves state-of-the art performance compared to existing neural models. Third, we use these finetuned models to search for tables that are unionable, joinable, or can be subsets of each other. Our results demonstrate improvements in F1 scores for search compared to state-of-the-art techniques (even up to 70% improvement in a joinable search benchmark). Finally, we show significant transfer across datasets and tasks establishing that our model can generalize across different tasks over different data lakes</description>

      <title>Guided Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Model-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing complex and high-dimensional black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering fields. Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants. The code is publicly available in \texttt{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/GTG}.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: Enhancing SPARQL Generation with Direct KG Integration in Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing KBQA methods have traditionally relied on multi-stage methodologies, involving tasks such as entity linking, subgraph retrieval and query structure generation. However, multi-stage approaches are dependent on the accuracy of preceding steps, leading to cascading errors and increased inference time. Although a few studies have explored the use of end-to-end models, they often suffer from lower accuracy and generate inoperative query that is not supported by the underlying data. Furthermore, most prior approaches are limited to the static training data, potentially overlooking the evolving nature of knowledge bases over time. To address these challenges, we present a novel end-to-end natural language to SPARQL framework, SPARKLE. Notably SPARKLE leverages the structure of knowledge base directly during the decoding, effectively integrating knowledge into the query generation. Our study reveals that simply referencing knowledge base during inference significantly reduces the occurrence of inexecutable query generations. SPARKLE achieves new state-of-the-art results on SimpleQuestions-Wiki and highest F1 score on LCQuAD 1.0 (among models not using gold entities), while getting slightly lower result on the WebQSP dataset. Finally, we demonstrate SPARKLE's fast inference speed and its ability to adapt when the knowledge base differs between the training and inference stages.</description>

      <title>A survey on the impact of AI-based recommenders on human behaviours: methodologies, outcomes and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems and assistants (in short, recommenders) are ubiquitous in online platforms and influence most actions of our day-to-day lives, suggesting items or providing solutions based on users' preferences or requests. This survey analyses the impact of recommenders in four human-AI ecosystems: social media, online retail, urban mapping and generative AI ecosystems. Its scope is to systematise a fast-growing field in which terminologies employed to classify methodologies and outcomes are fragmented and unsystematic. We follow the customary steps of qualitative systematic review, gathering 144 articles from different disciplines to develop a parsimonious taxonomy of: methodologies employed (empirical, simulation, observational, controlled), outcomes observed (concentration, model collapse, diversity, echo chamber, filter bubble, inequality, polarisation, radicalisation, volume), and their level of analysis (individual, item, model, and systemic). We systematically discuss all findings of our survey substantively and methodologically, highlighting also potential avenues for future research. This survey is addressed to scholars and practitioners interested in different human-AI ecosystems, policymakers and institutional stakeholders who want to understand better the measurable outcomes of recommenders, and tech companies who wish to obtain a systematic view of the impact of their recommenders.</description>

      <title>Commute Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time information is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs.</description>

      <title>LASSI: An LLM-based Automated Self-Correcting Pipeline for Translating Parallel Scientific Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of providing a novel approach to sourcing significant training data for LLMs focused on science and engineering. In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework, called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI.
  The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</description>

      <title>ESALE: Enhancing Code-Summary Alignment Learning for Source Code Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Source) code summarization aims to automatically generate succinct natural language summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a significant role in promoting developers to understand and maintain code. Inspired by neural machine translation, deep learning-based code summarization techniques widely adopt an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder transforms given code snippets into context vectors, and the decoder decodes context vectors into summaries. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models for source code are equipped with encoders capable of producing general context vectors and have achieved substantial improvements on code summarization. However, although they are usually trained mainly on code-focused tasks and can capture general code features, they still fall short in capturing specific features that need to be summarized.
  This paper proposes a novel approach to improve code summarization based on summary-focused tasks. Specifically, we exploit a multi-task learning paradigm to train the encoder on three summary-focused tasks to enhance its ability to learn code-summary alignment, including unidirectional language modeling (ULM), masked language modeling (MLM), and action word prediction (AWP). Unlike pre-trained models that mainly predict masked tokens in code snippets, we design ULM and MLM to predict masked words in summaries. Intuitively, predicting words based on given code snippets would help learn the code-summary alignment. Additionally, we introduce the domain-specific task AWP to enhance the ability of the encoder to learn the alignment between action words and code snippets. The extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our approach, called ESALE significantly outperforms baselines in all three widely used metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L.</description>

Abstract: Timely alerts about hazardous air pollutants are crucial for public health. However, existing forecasting models often overlook key factors like baseline parameters and missing data, limiting their accuracy. This study introduces a hybrid approach to address these issues, focusing on forecasting hourly PM2.5 concentrations using Support Vector Regression (SVR). Meta-heuristic algorithms, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), optimize SVR Hyper-parameters "C" and "Gamma" to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluation metrics include R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Results show significant improvements with PSO-SVR (R2: 0.9401, RMSE: 0.2390, MAE: 0.1368) and GWO-SVR (R2: 0.9408, RMSE: 0.2376, MAE: 0.1373), indicating robust and accurate models suitable for similar research applications.</description>

Abstract: Dairy farms consume a significant amount of electricity for their operations, and this research focuses on enhancing energy efficiency and minimizing the impact on the environment in the sector by maximizing the utilization of renewable energy sources. This research investigates the application of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL), to enhance dairy farming battery management. We evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness based on its ability to reduce reliance on the electricity grid, highlighting the potential of DRL to enhance energy management in dairy farming. Using real-world data our results demonstrate how the PPO approach outperforms Q-learning by 1.62% for reducing electricity import from the grid. This significant improvement highlights the potential of the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm for improving energy efficiency and sustainability in dairy farms.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Chain-of-Thought: Probability, Memorization, and Noisy Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. GPT-4 achieves zero accuracy on most shift ciphers with standard prompting, but with CoT its accuracy improves to an average of 32%. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence the task accuracy; e.g., varying the output's probability of occurrence can shift accuracy from 26% to 70%. We also demonstrate that it is essential for the model to explicitly produce intermediate steps as output that can be conditioned on to increase the probability of the correct answer. Our experiments indicate that as long as the model does so, the validity of the demonstrations in the prompt does not matter. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning.</description>

      <title>NLPGuard: A Framework for Mitigating the Use of Protected Attributes by NLP Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI regulations are expected to prohibit machine learning models from using sensitive attributes during training. However, the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifiers, which rely on deep learning, operate as black-box systems, complicating the detection and remediation of such misuse. Traditional bias mitigation methods in NLP aim for comparable performance across different groups based on attributes like gender or race but fail to address the underlying issue of reliance on protected attributes. To partly fix that, we introduce NLPGuard, a framework for mitigating the reliance on protected attributes in NLP classifiers. NLPGuard takes an unlabeled dataset, an existing NLP classifier, and its training data as input, producing a modified training dataset that significantly reduces dependence on protected attributes without compromising accuracy. NLPGuard is applied to three classification tasks: identifying toxic language, sentiment analysis, and occupation classification. Our evaluation shows that current NLP classifiers heavily depend on protected attributes, with up to $23\%$ of the most predictive words associated with these attributes. However, NLPGuard effectively reduces this reliance by up to $79\%$, while slightly improving accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many failures in deep continual and reinforcement learning are associated with increasing magnitudes of the weights, making them hard to change and potentially causing overfitting. While many methods address these learning failures, they often change the optimizer or the architecture, a complexity that hinders widespread adoption in various systems. In this paper, we focus on learning failures that are associated with increasing weight norm and we propose a simple technique that can be easily added on top of existing learning systems: clipping neural network weights to limit them to a specific range. We study the effectiveness of weight clipping in a series of supervised and reinforcement learning experiments. Our empirical results highlight the benefits of weight clipping for generalization, addressing loss of plasticity and policy collapse, and facilitating learning with a large replay ratio.</description>

False positives introduce the risk of erroneously identifying non-existent conditions, leading to misdiagnosis and a decline in patient care quality. Conversely, false negatives pose the threat of overlooking genuine abnormalities, potentially causing delays in treatment and interventions, thereby resulting in adverse patient outcomes. The urgency to overcome these challenges compels ongoing efforts to elevate the precision and reliability of X-ray image analysis algorithms within the computational framework. This study introduces modified pre-trained ResNet models tailored for multi-class disease diagnosis of X-ray images, incorporating advanced optimization strategies to reduce the execution runtime of training and inference tasks. The primary objective is to achieve tangible performance improvements through accelerated implementations of PyTorch, CUDA, Mixed- Precision Training, and Learning Rate Scheduler. While outcomes demonstrate substantial improvements in execution runtimes between normal training and CUDA-accelerated training, negligible differences emerge between various training optimization modalities. This research marks a significant advancement in optimizing computational approaches to reduce training execution time for larger models. Additionally, we explore the potential of effective parallel data processing using MPI4Py for the distribution of gradient descent optimization across multiple nodes and leverage multiprocessing to expedite data preprocessing for larger datasets.</description>

      <title>DiscoveryBench: Towards Data-Driven Discovery with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can the rapid advances in code generation, function calling, and data analysis using large language models (LLMs) help automate the search and verification of hypotheses purely from a set of provided datasets? To evaluate this question, we present DiscoveryBench, the first comprehensive benchmark that formalizes the multi-step process of data-driven discovery. The benchmark is designed to systematically assess current model capabilities in discovery tasks and provide a useful resource for improving them. Our benchmark contains 264 tasks collected across 6 diverse domains, such as sociology and engineering, by manually deriving discovery workflows from published papers to approximate the real-world challenges faced by researchers, where each task is defined by a dataset, its metadata, and a discovery goal in natural language. We additionally provide 903 synthetic tasks to conduct controlled evaluations across task complexity. Furthermore, our structured formalism of data-driven discovery enables a facet-based evaluation that provides useful insights into different failure modes. We evaluate several popular LLM-based reasoning frameworks using both open and closed LLMs as baselines on DiscoveryBench and find that even the best system scores only 25%. Our benchmark, thus, illustrates the challenges in autonomous data-driven discovery and serves as a valuable resource for the community to make progress.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a crucial technique for characterizing the state of a quantum system, which is essential for many applications in quantum technologies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging neural networks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography. Still, many of them did not include mixed quantum state, since pure states are arguably less common in practical situations. In this research paper, we present two neural networks based approach for both pure and mixed quantum state tomography: Restricted Feature Based Neural Network and Mixed States Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to existing neural based methods. We demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art results in reconstructing mixed quantum states from experimental data. Our work highlights the potential of neural networks in revolutionizing quantum state tomography and facilitating the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

      <title>Invariant Correlation of Representation with Label</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) approach aims to address the challenge of domain generalization by training a feature representation that remains invariant across multiple environments. However, in noisy environments, IRM-related techniques such as IRMv1 and VREx may be unable to achieve the optimal IRM solution, primarily due to erroneous optimization directions. To address this issue, we introduce ICorr (an abbreviation for \textbf{I}nvariant \textbf{Corr}elation), a novel approach designed to surmount the above challenge in noisy settings. Additionally, we dig into a case study to analyze why previous methods may lose ground while ICorr can succeed. Through a theoretical lens, particularly from a causality perspective, we illustrate that the invariant correlation of representation with label is a necessary condition for the optimal invariant predictor in noisy environments, whereas the optimization motivations for other methods may not be. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ICorr by comparing it with other domain generalization methods on various noisy datasets.</description>

      <title>Predicting Trust Dynamics with Dynamic SEM in Human-AI Cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans' trust in AI constitutes a pivotal element in fostering a synergistic relationship between humans and AI. This is particularly significant in the context of systems that leverage AI technology, such as autonomous driving systems and human-robot interaction. Trust facilitates appropriate utilization of these systems, thereby optimizing their potential benefits. If humans over-trust or under-trust an AI, serious problems such as misuse and accidents occur. To prevent over/under-trust, it is necessary to predict trust dynamics. However, trust is an internal state of humans and hard to directly observe. Therefore, we propose a prediction model for trust dynamics using dynamic structure equation modeling, which extends SEM that can handle time-series data. A path diagram, which shows causalities between variables, is developed in an exploratory way and the resultant path diagram is optimized for effective path structures. Over/under-trust was predicted with 90\% accuracy in a drone simulator task,, and it was predicted with 99\% accuracy in an autonomous driving task. These results show that our proposed method outperformed the conventional method including an auto regression family.</description>

Abstract: Accurate classification of mode choice datasets is crucial for transportation planning and decision-making processes. However, conventional classification models often struggle to adequately capture the nuanced patterns of minority classes within these datasets, leading to sub-optimal accuracy. In response to this challenge, we present Ensemble Synthesizer (ENSY) which leverages probability distribution for data augmentation, a novel data model tailored specifically for enhancing classification accuracy in mode choice datasets. In our study, ENSY demonstrates remarkable efficacy by nearly quadrupling the F1 score of minority classes and improving overall classification accuracy by nearly 3%. To assess its performance comprehensively, we compare ENSY against various augmentation techniques including Random Oversampling, SMOTE-NC, and CTGAN. Through experimentation, ENSY consistently outperforms these methods across various scenarios, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness</description>

      <title>Deepfake Audio Detection Using Spectrogram-based Feature and Ensemble of Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based system for the task of deepfake audio detection. In particular, the draw input audio is first transformed into various spectrograms using three transformation methods of Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), Wavelet Transform (WT) combined with different auditory-based filters of Mel, Gammatone, linear filters (LF), and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Given the spectrograms, we evaluate a wide range of classification models based on three deep learning approaches. The first approach is to train directly the spectrograms using our proposed baseline models of CNN-based model (CNN-baseline), RNN-based model (RNN-baseline), C-RNN model (C-RNN baseline). Meanwhile, the second approach is transfer learning from computer vision models such as ResNet-18, MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet-121, SuffleNet-V2, Swint, Convnext-Tiny, GoogLeNet, MNASsnet, RegNet. In the third approach, we leverage the state-of-the-art audio pre-trained models of Whisper, Seamless, Speechbrain, and Pyannote to extract audio embeddings from the input spectrograms. Then, the audio embeddings are explored by a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to detect the fake or real audio samples. Finally, high-performance deep learning models from these approaches are fused to achieve the best performance. We evaluated our proposed models on ASVspoof 2019 benchmark dataset. Our best ensemble model achieved an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.03, which is highly competitive to top-performing systems in the ASVspoofing 2019 challenge. Experimental results also highlight the potential of selective spectrograms and deep learning approaches to enhance the task of audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Addressing a fundamental limitation in deep vision models: lack of spatial attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of this manuscript is to underscore a significant limitation in current deep learning models, particularly vision models. Unlike human vision, which efficiently selects only the essential visual areas for further processing, leading to high speed and low energy consumption, deep vision models process the entire image. In this work, we examine this issue from a broader perspective and propose a solution that could pave the way for the next generation of more efficient vision models. Basically, convolution and pooling operations are selectively applied to altered regions, with a change map sent to subsequent layers. This map indicates which computations need to be repeated. The code is available at https://github.com/aliborji/spatial_attention.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Persuasive Strategies in Meme Texts: A Fusion of Language Models with Paraphrase Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes our approach to hierarchical multi-label detection of persuasion techniques in meme texts. Our model, developed as a part of the recent SemEval task, is based on fine-tuning individual language models (BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mBERT) and leveraging a mean-based ensemble model in addition to dataset augmentation through paraphrase generation from ChatGPT. The scope of the study encompasses enhancing model performance through innovative training techniques and data augmentation strategies. The problem addressed is the effective identification and classification of multiple persuasive techniques in meme texts, a task complicated by the diversity and complexity of such content. The objective of the paper is to improve detection accuracy by refining model training methods and examining the impact of balanced versus unbalanced training datasets. Novelty in the results and discussion lies in the finding that training with paraphrases enhances model performance, yet a balanced training set proves more advantageous than a larger unbalanced one. Additionally, the analysis reveals the potential pitfalls of indiscriminate incorporation of paraphrases from diverse distributions, which can introduce substantial noise. Results with the SemEval 2024 data confirm these insights, demonstrating improved model efficacy with the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown great progress in integrating spatial conditioning to control large, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Despite these advances, existing methods describe the spatial image content using hand-crafted conditioning inputs, which are either semantically ambiguous (e.g., edges) or require expensive manual annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation). To address these limitations, we propose a new label-free way of conditioning diffusion models to enable fine-grained spatial control. We introduce the concept of neural semantic image synthesis, which uses neural layouts extracted from pre-trained foundation models as conditioning. Neural layouts are advantageous as they provide rich descriptions of the desired image, containing both semantics and detailed geometry of the scene. We experimentally show that images synthesized via neural semantic image synthesis achieve similar or superior pixel-level alignment of semantic classes compared to those created using expensive semantic label maps. At the same time, they capture better semantics, instance separation, and object orientation than other label-free conditioning options, such as edges or depth. Moreover, we show that images generated by neural layout conditioning can effectively augment real data for training various perception tasks.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in microscopy have enabled the rapid generation of terabytes of image data in cell biology and biomedical research. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution for large-scale biological image analysis, enhancing researchers' efficiency, identifying new image biomarkers, and accelerating hypothesis generation and scientific discovery. However, there is a lack of standardized, diverse, and large-scale vision-language benchmarks to evaluate VLMs' perception and cognition capabilities in biological image understanding. To address this gap, we introduce {\mu}-Bench, an expert-curated benchmark encompassing 22 biomedical tasks across various scientific disciplines (biology, pathology), microscopy modalities (electron, fluorescence, light), scales (subcellular, cellular, tissue), and organisms in both normal and abnormal states. We evaluate state-of-the-art biomedical, pathology, and general VLMs on {\mu}-Bench and find that: i) current models struggle on all categories, even for basic tasks such as distinguishing microscopy modalities; ii) current specialist models fine-tuned on biomedical data often perform worse than generalist models; iii) fine-tuning in specific microscopy domains can cause catastrophic forgetting, eroding prior biomedical knowledge encoded in their base model. iv) weight interpolation between fine-tuned and pre-trained models offers one solution to forgetting and improves general performance across biomedical tasks. We release {\mu}-Bench under a permissive license to accelerate the research and development of microscopy foundation models.</description>

      <title>Normalization and effective learning rates in reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalization layers have recently experienced a renaissance in the deep reinforcement learning and continual learning literature, with several works highlighting diverse benefits such as improving loss landscape conditioning and combatting overestimation bias. However, normalization brings with it a subtle but important side effect: an equivalence between growth in the norm of the network parameters and decay in the effective learning rate. This becomes problematic in continual learning settings, where the resulting effective learning rate schedule may decay to near zero too quickly relative to the timescale of the learning problem. We propose to make the learning rate schedule explicit with a simple re-parameterization which we call Normalize-and-Project (NaP), which couples the insertion of normalization layers with weight projection, ensuring that the effective learning rate remains constant throughout training. This technique reveals itself as a powerful analytical tool to better understand learning rate schedules in deep reinforcement learning, and as a means of improving robustness to nonstationarity in synthetic plasticity loss benchmarks along with both the single-task and sequential variants of the Arcade Learning Environment. We also show that our approach can be easily applied to popular architectures such as ResNets and transformers while recovering and in some cases even slightly improving the performance of the base model in common stationary benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: A project (e.g. writing a collaborative research paper) is often a group effort. At the end, each contributor identifies his or her contribution, often verbally. The reward, however, is quite often financial in nature. This leads to the question of what (percentage) share in the creation of the paper is due to individual authors. Different authors may have various opinions on the matter, and, even worse, their opinions may have different relevance. In this paper, we present a simple models that allows aggregation of experts' opinions linking the priority of his preference directly to the assessment made by other experts. In this approach, the greater the contribution of a given expert, the greater the importance of his opinion. The presented method can be considered as an attempt to find consensus among a group of peers involved in the same project. Hence, its applications may go beyond the proposed study example of writing a scientific paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models' remarkable proficiency in text-based tasks, recent works on Multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend them to other modalities like vision and audio. However, the progress in these directions has been mostly focused on tasks that only require a coarse-grained understanding of the audio-visual semantics. We present Meerkat, an audio-visual LLM equipped with a fine-grained understanding of image and audio both spatially and temporally. With a new modality alignment module based on optimal transport and a cross-attention module that enforces audio-visual consistency, Meerkat can tackle challenging tasks such as audio referred image grounding, image guided audio temporal localization, and audio-visual fact-checking. Moreover, we carefully curate a large dataset AVFIT that comprises 3M instruction tuning samples collected from open-source datasets, and introduce MeerkatBench that unifies five challenging audio-visual tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on all these downstream tasks with a relative improvement of up to 37.12%.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced instruction-following capabilities. However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) datasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other languages. Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets such as translating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets into IFT datasets by templating, struggle to capture linguistic nuances and ensure prompt (instruction) diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic naturalness and ensures prompt diversity. This approach leverages English-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create high-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable improvements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced language comprehension by LLMs in non-English contexts. Specifically, on the multilingual summarization task, LLMs using our IFT dataset achieved 17.57% and 15.23% improvements over LLMs fine-tuned with translation-based and template-based datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Research on target detection method of distracted driving behavior based on improved YOLOv8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning technology, the detection and classification of distracted driving behaviour requires higher accuracy. Existing deep learning-based methods are computationally intensive and parameter redundant, limiting the efficiency and accuracy in practical applications. To solve this problem, this study proposes an improved YOLOv8 detection method based on the original YOLOv8 model by integrating the BoTNet module, GAM attention mechanism and EIoU loss function. By optimising the feature extraction and multi-scale feature fusion strategies, the training and inference processes are simplified, and the detection accuracy and efficiency are significantly improved. Experimental results show that the improved model performs well in both detection speed and accuracy, with an accuracy rate of 99.4%, and the model is smaller and easy to deploy, which is able to identify and classify distracted driving behaviours in real time, provide timely warnings, and enhance driving safety.</description>

      <title>Automated Text Scoring in the Age of Generative AI for the GPU-poor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on generative language models (GLMs) for automated text scoring (ATS) has focused almost exclusively on querying proprietary models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Yet such practices raise issues around transparency and security, and these methods offer little in the way of efficiency or customizability. With the recent proliferation of smaller, open-source models, there is the option to explore GLMs with computers equipped with modest, consumer-grade hardware, that is, for the "GPU poor." In this study, we analyze the performance and efficiency of open-source, small-scale GLMs for ATS. Results show that GLMs can be fine-tuned to achieve adequate, though not state-of-the-art, performance. In addition to ATS, we take small steps towards analyzing models' capacity for generating feedback by prompting GLMs to explain their scores. Model-generated feedback shows promise, but requires more rigorous evaluation focused on targeted use cases.</description>

      <title>Survey on Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models: Methods, Evaluation, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional capabilities in various domains, attracting significant interest from both academia and industry. Despite their impressive performance, the substantial size and computational demands of LLMs pose considerable challenges for practical deployment, particularly in environments with limited resources. The endeavor to compress language models while maintaining their accuracy has become a focal point of research. Among the various methods, knowledge distillation has emerged as an effective technique to enhance inference speed without greatly compromising performance. This paper presents a thorough survey from three aspects: method, evaluation, and application, exploring knowledge distillation techniques tailored specifically for LLMs. Specifically, we divide the methods into white-box KD and black-box KD to better illustrate their differences. Furthermore, we also explored the evaluation tasks and distillation effects between different distillation methods, and proposed directions for future research. Through in-depth understanding of the latest advancements and practical applications, this survey provides valuable resources for researchers, paving the way for sustained progress in this field.</description>

      <title>Core Knowledge Learning Framework for Graph Adaptation and Scalability Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph classification is a pivotal challenge in machine learning, especially within the realm of graph-based data, given its importance in numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. Despite its significance, graph classification faces several hurdles, including adapting to diverse prediction tasks, training across multiple target domains, and handling small-sample prediction scenarios. Current methods often tackle these challenges individually, leading to fragmented solutions that lack a holistic approach to the overarching problem. In this paper, we propose an algorithm aimed at addressing the aforementioned challenges. By incorporating insights from various types of tasks, our method aims to enhance adaptability, scalability, and generalizability in graph classification. Motivated by the recognition that the underlying subgraph plays a crucial role in GNN prediction, while the remainder is task-irrelevant, we introduce the Core Knowledge Learning (\method{}) framework for graph adaptation and scalability learning. \method{} comprises several key modules, including the core subgraph knowledge submodule, graph domain adaptation module, and few-shot learning module for downstream tasks. Each module is tailored to tackle specific challenges in graph classification, such as domain shift, label inconsistencies, and data scarcity. By learning the core subgraph of the entire graph, we focus on the most pertinent features for task relevance. Consequently, our method offers benefits such as improved model performance, increased domain adaptability, and enhanced robustness to domain variations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements achieved by our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Beyond Numeric Awards: In-Context Dueling Bandits with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context decision-making is an important capability of artificial general intelligence, which Large Language Models (LLMs) have effectively demonstrated in various scenarios. However, LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper investigates the performance of LLMs as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB). We first evaluate the performance of LLMs by comparing GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo against established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, thus outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To overcome these issues, we introduce an LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, which takes advantage of both in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms. The design of such an algorithm sheds light on how to enhance trustworthiness for LLMs used in decision-making tasks where performance robustness matters. We show that IF-Enhanced LLM has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret. Our experimental results validate that IF-Enhanced LLM is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts.</description>

      <title>SoP: Unlock the Power of Social Facilitation for Automatic Jailbreak Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread applications of large language models (LLMs) have brought about concerns regarding their potential misuse. Although aligned with human preference data before release, LLMs remain vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we adopt a red-teaming strategy to enhance LLM safety and introduce SoP, a simple yet effective framework to design jailbreak prompts automatically. Inspired by the social facilitation concept, SoP generates and optimizes multiple jailbreak characters to bypass the guardrails of the target LLM. Different from previous work which relies on proprietary LLMs or seed jailbreak templates crafted by human expertise, SoP can generate and optimize the jailbreak prompt in a cold-start scenario using open-sourced LLMs without any seed jailbreak templates. Experimental results show that SoP achieves attack success rates of 88% and 60% in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-3.5-1106 and GPT-4, respectively. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the transferability of the generated templates across different LLMs and held-out malicious requests, while also exploring defense strategies against the jailbreak attack designed by SoP. Code is available at https://github.com/Yang-Yan-Yang-Yan/SoP.</description>

      <title>Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations. However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment.</description>

      <title>Let the Expert Stick to His Last: Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning for Sparse Architectural Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is crucial for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with constrained resources. Although there have been various PEFT methods for dense-architecture LLMs, PEFT for sparse-architecture LLMs is still underexplored. In this work, we study the PEFT method for LLMs with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and the contents of this work are mainly threefold: (1) We investigate the dispersion degree of the activated experts in customized tasks, and found that the routing distribution for a specific task tends to be highly concentrated, while the distribution of activated experts varies significantly across different tasks. (2) We propose Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning, or ESFT, which tunes the experts most relevant to downstream tasks while freezing the other experts and modules; experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves the tuning efficiency, but also matches or even surpasses the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning. (3) We further analyze the impact of the MoE architecture on expert-specialized fine-tuning. We find that MoE models with finer-grained experts are more advantageous in selecting the combination of experts that are most relevant to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing both the training efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MG-Verilog: Multi-grained Dataset Towards Enhanced LLM-assisted Verilog Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in streamlining hardware design processes by encapsulating vast amounts of domain-specific data. In addition, they allow users to interact with the design processes through natural language instructions, thus making hardware design more accessible to developers. However, effectively leveraging LLMs in hardware design necessitates providing domain-specific data during inference (e.g., through in-context learning), fine-tuning, or pre-training. Unfortunately, existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in hardware design tasks. To address this issue, we first propose a set of criteria for creating high-quality hardware datasets that can effectively enhance LLM-assisted hardware design. Based on these criteria, we propose a Multi-Grained-Verilog (MG-Verilog) dataset, which encompasses descriptions at various levels of detail and corresponding code samples. To benefit the broader hardware design community, we have developed an open-source infrastructure that facilitates easy access, integration, and extension of the dataset to meet specific project needs. Furthermore, to fully exploit the potential of the MG-Verilog dataset, which varies in complexity and detail, we introduce a balanced fine-tuning scheme. This scheme serves as a unique use case to leverage the diverse levels of detail provided by the dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset and fine-tuning scheme consistently improve the performance of LLMs in hardware design tasks.</description>

      <title>A Method to Facilitate Membership Inference Attacks in Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) ecosystems offer a surging number of ML frameworks and code repositories that can greatly facilitate the development of ML models. Today, even ordinary data holders who are not ML experts can apply off-the-shelf codebase to build high-performance ML models on their data, many of which are sensitive in nature (e.g., clinical records).
  In this work, we consider a malicious ML provider who supplies model-training code to the data holders, does not have access to the training process, and has only black-box query access to the resulting model. In this setting, we demonstrate a new form of membership inference attack that is strictly more powerful than prior art. Our attack empowers the adversary to reliably de-identify all the training samples (average &gt;99% attack TPR@0.1% FPR), and the compromised models still maintain competitive performance as their uncorrupted counterparts (average &lt;1% accuracy drop). Moreover, we show that the poisoned models can effectively disguise the amplified membership leakage under common membership privacy auditing, which can only be revealed by a set of secret samples known by the adversary.
  Overall, our study not only points to the worst-case membership privacy leakage, but also unveils a common pitfall underlying existing privacy auditing methods, which calls for future efforts to rethink the current practice of auditing membership privacy in machine learning models.</description>

      <title>To Forget or Not? Towards Practical Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora inevitably retain sensitive data, such as personal privacy information and copyrighted material. Recent advancements in knowledge unlearning involve updating LLM parameters to erase specific knowledge. However, current unlearning paradigms are mired in vague forgetting boundaries, often erasing knowledge indiscriminately. In this work, we introduce KnowUnDo, a benchmark containing copyrighted content and user privacy domains to evaluate if the unlearning process inadvertently erases essential knowledge. Our findings indicate that existing unlearning methods often suffer from excessive unlearning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, MemFlex, which utilizes gradient information to precisely target and unlearn sensitive parameters. Experimental results show that MemFlex is superior to existing methods in both precise knowledge unlearning and general knowledge retaining of LLMs. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowUnDo.</description>

Abstract: The term Language Models (LMs), as a time-specific collection of models of interest, is constantly reinvented, with its referents updated much like the $\textit{Ship of Theseus}$ replaces its parts but remains the same ship in essence. In this paper, we investigate this $\textit{Ship of Language Models}$ problem, wherein scientific evolution takes the form of continuous, implicit retrofits of key existing terms. We seek to initiate a novel perspective of scientific progress, in addition to the more well-studied emergence of new terms. To this end, we construct the data infrastructure based on recent NLP publications. Then, we perform a series of text-based analyses toward a detailed, quantitative understanding of the use of Language Models as a term of art. Our work highlights how systems and theories influence each other in scientific discourse, and we call for attention to the transformation of this Ship that we all are contributing to.</description>

      <title>Extracting and Encoding: Leveraging Large Language Models and Medical Knowledge to Enhance Radiological Text Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing representation learning in specialized fields like medicine remains challenging due to the scarcity of expert annotations for text and images. To tackle this issue, we present a novel two-stage framework designed to extract high-quality factual statements from free-text radiology reports in order to improve the representations of text encoders and, consequently, their performance on various downstream tasks. In the first stage, we propose a \textit{Fact Extractor} that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify factual statements from well-curated domain-specific datasets. In the second stage, we introduce a \textit{Fact Encoder} (CXRFE) based on a BERT model fine-tuned with objective functions designed to improve its representations using the extracted factual data. Our framework also includes a new embedding-based metric (CXRFEScore) for evaluating chest X-ray text generation systems, leveraging both stages of our approach. Extensive evaluations show that our fact extractor and encoder outperform current state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as sentence ranking, natural language inference, and label extraction from radiology reports. Additionally, our metric proves to be more robust and effective than existing metrics commonly used in the radiology report generation literature. The code of this project is available at \url{https://github.com/PabloMessina/CXR-Fact-Encoder}.</description>

      <title>LDP: A Local Diffusion Planner for Efficient Robot Navigation and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conditional diffusion model has been demonstrated as an efficient tool for learning robot policies, owing to its advancement to accurately model the conditional distribution of policies. The intricate nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by dynamic obstacles and maze-like structures, underscores the complexity of robot local navigation decision-making as a conditional distribution problem. Nevertheless, leveraging the diffusion model for robot local navigation is not trivial and encounters several under-explored challenges: (1) Data Urgency. The complex conditional distribution in local navigation needs training data to include diverse policy in diverse real-world scenarios; (2) Myopic Observation. Due to the diversity of the perception scenarios, diffusion decisions based on the local perspective of robots may prove suboptimal for completing the entire task, as they often lack foresight. In certain scenarios requiring detours, the robot may become trapped. To address these issues, our approach begins with an exploration of a diverse data generation mechanism that encompasses multiple agents exhibiting distinct preferences through target selection informed by integrated global-local insights. Then, based on this diverse training data, a diffusion agent is obtained, capable of excellent collision avoidance in diverse scenarios. Subsequently, we augment our Local Diffusion Planner, also known as LDP by incorporating global observations in a lightweight manner. This enhancement broadens the observational scope of LDP, effectively mitigating the risk of becoming ensnared in local optima and promoting more robust navigational decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into financial analysis has garnered significant attention in the NLP community. This paper presents our solution to IJCAI-2024 FinLLM challenge, investigating the capabilities of LLMs within three critical areas of financial tasks: financial classification, financial text summarization, and single stock trading. We adopted Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B as base models, fine-tuning them through Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches. To enhance model performance, we combine datasets from task 1 and task 2 for data fusion. Our approach aims to tackle these diverse tasks in a comprehensive and integrated manner, showcasing LLMs' capacity to address diverse and complex financial tasks with improved accuracy and decision-making capabilities.</description>

      <title>MeMemo: On-device Retrieval Augmentation for Private and Personalized Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented text generation (RAG) addresses the common limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucination, by retrieving information from an updatable external knowledge base. However, existing approaches often require dedicated backend servers for data storage and retrieval, thereby limiting their applicability in use cases that require strict data privacy, such as personal finance, education, and medicine. To address the pressing need for client-side dense retrieval, we introduce MeMemo, the first open-source JavaScript toolkit that adapts the state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search technique HNSW to browser environments. Developed with modern and native Web technologies, such as IndexedDB and Web Workers, our toolkit leverages client-side hardware capabilities to enable researchers and developers to efficiently search through millions of high-dimensional vectors in the browser. MeMemo enables exciting new design and research opportunities, such as private and personalized content creation and interactive prototyping, as demonstrated in our example application RAG Playground. Reflecting on our work, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for on-device dense retrieval. MeMemo is available at https://github.com/poloclub/mememo.</description>

      <title>A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. In particular, LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in Key Information Extraction (KIE) and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements, with a 27.0% increase on KIE tasks and 24.1% on VQA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art document understanding MLLMs, as well as a 15.5% improvement over other SOTA OCR-based LLMs on KIE tasks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Global Interactive Patterns across Graphs: Towards Interpretable Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent framework for graph mining, leading to significant advances across various domains. Stemmed from the node-wise representations of GNNs, existing explanation studies have embraced the subgraph-specific viewpoint that attributes the decision results to the salient features and local structures of nodes. However, graph-level tasks necessitate long-range dependencies and global interactions for advanced GNNs, deviating significantly from subgraph-specific explanations. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel intrinsically interpretable scheme for graph classification, termed as Global Interactive Pattern (GIP) learning, which introduces learnable global interactive patterns to explicitly interpret decisions. GIP first tackles the complexity of interpretation by clustering numerous nodes using a constrained graph clustering module. Then, it matches the coarsened global interactive instance with a batch of self-interpretable graph prototypes, thereby facilitating a transparent graph-level reasoning process. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GIP yields significantly superior interpretability and competitive performance to~the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: To find the shortest paths for all pairs on continuous manifolds with infinitesimally defined metrics, we propose to generate them by predicting midpoints recursively and an actor-critic method to learn midpoint prediction.

      <title>SAVE: Segment Audio-Visual Easy way using Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to precisely identify and locate auditory elements within visual scenes by accurately predicting segmentation masks at the pixel level. Achieving this involves comprehensively considering data and model aspects to address this task effectively. This study presents a lightweight approach, SAVE, which efficiently adapts the pre-trained segment anything model (SAM) to the AVS task. By incorporating an image encoder adapter into the transformer blocks to better capture the distinct dataset information and proposing a residual audio encoder adapter to encode the audio features as a sparse prompt, our proposed model achieves effective audio-visual fusion and interaction during the encoding stage. Our proposed method accelerates the training and inference speed by reducing the input resolution from 1024 to 256 pixels while achieving higher performance compared with the previous SOTA. Extensive experimentation validates our approach, demonstrating that our proposed model outperforms other SOTA methods significantly. Moreover, leveraging the pre-trained model on synthetic data enhances performance on real AVSBench data, achieving 84.59 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) subset and 70.28 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) set with only 256 pixels for input images. This increases up to 86.16 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) and 70.83 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) with inputs of 1024 pixels.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Sparse Geometric MPNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that such models can separate generic pairs of non-equivalent geometric graphs, though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However, these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application, every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors. This paper shows that generic pairs of non-equivalent geometric graphs can be separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, EGENNET, which achieves our theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on synthetic and chemical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Why does in-context learning fail sometimes? Evaluating in-context learning on open and closed questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the performance of in-context learning as a function of task novelty and difficulty for open and closed questions. For that purpose, we created a novel benchmark consisting of hard scientific questions, each paired with a context of various relevancy. We show that counter-intuitively, a context that is more aligned with the topic does not always help more than a less relevant context. This effect is especially visible for open questions and questions of high difficulty or novelty. This result reveals a fundamental difference between the treatment of close-form and open-form questions by large-language models and shows a need for a more robust evaluation of in-context learning on the variety of different types of questions. It also poses a new question of how to optimally select a context for large language models, especially in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our results suggest that the answer to this question can be highly application-dependent and might be contingent on factors including the format of the question, the perceived difficulty level of the questions, and the novelty or popularity of the information we seek.</description>

      <title>SwiftDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper documents our characterization study and practices for serving text-to-image requests with stable diffusion models in production. We first comprehensively analyze inference request traces for commercial text-to-image applications. It commences with our observation that add-on modules, i.e., ControlNets and LoRAs, that augment the base stable diffusion models, are ubiquitous in generating images for commercial applications. Despite their efficacy, these add-on modules incur high loading overhead, prolong the serving latency, and swallow up expensive GPU resources. Driven by our characterization study, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently generates high-quality images using stable diffusion models and add-on modules. To achieve this, SwiftDiffusion reconstructs the existing text-to-image serving workflow by identifying the opportunities for parallel computation and distributing ControlNet computations across multiple GPUs. Further, SwiftDiffusion thoroughly analyzes the dynamics of image generation and develops techniques to eliminate the overhead associated with LoRA loading and patching while preserving the image quality. Last, SwiftDiffusion proposes specialized optimizations in the backbone architecture of the stable diffusion models, which are also compatible with the efficient serving of add-on modules. Compared to state-of-the-art text-to-image serving systems, SwiftDiffusion reduces serving latency by up to 5x and improves serving throughput by up to 2x without compromising image quality.</description>

      <title>ScaleDreamer: Scalable Text-to-3D Synthesis with Asynchronous Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the text-to-image diffusion priors, score distillation can synthesize 3D contents without paired text-3D training data. Instead of spending hours of online optimization per text prompt, recent studies have been focused on learning a text-to-3D generative network for amortizing multiple text-3D relations, which can synthesize 3D contents in seconds. However, existing score distillation methods are hard to scale up to a large amount of text prompts due to the difficulties in aligning pretrained diffusion prior with the distribution of rendered images from various text prompts. Current state-of-the-arts such as Variational Score Distillation finetune the pretrained diffusion model to minimize the noise prediction error so as to align the distributions, which are however unstable to train and will impair the model's comprehension capability to numerous text prompts. Based on the observation that the diffusion models tend to have lower noise prediction errors at earlier timesteps, we propose Asynchronous Score Distillation (ASD), which minimizes the noise prediction error by shifting the diffusion timestep to earlier ones. ASD is stable to train and can scale up to 100k prompts. It reduces the noise prediction error without changing the weights of pre-trained diffusion model, thus keeping its strong comprehension capability to prompts. We conduct extensive experiments across different 2D diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion and MVDream, and text-to-3D generators, including Hyper-iNGP, 3DConv-Net and Triplane-Transformer. The results demonstrate ASD's effectiveness in stable 3D generator training, high-quality 3D content synthesis, and its superior prompt-consistency, especially under large prompt corpus.</description>

      <title>Fake News Detection and Manipulation Reasoning via Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake news becomes a growing threat to information security and public opinion with the rapid sprawl of media manipulation. Therefore, fake news detection attracts widespread attention from academic community. Traditional fake news detection models demonstrate remarkable performance on authenticity binary classification but their ability to reason detailed faked traces based on the news content remains under-explored. Furthermore, due to the lack of external knowledge, the performance of existing methods on fact-related news is questionable, leaving their practical implementation unclear. In this paper, we propose a new multi-media research topic, namely manipulation reasoning. Manipulation reasoning aims to reason manipulations based on news content. To support the research, we introduce a benchmark for fake news detection and manipulation reasoning, referred to as Human-centric and Fact-related Fake News (HFFN). The benchmark highlights the centrality of human and the high factual relevance, with detailed manual annotations. HFFN encompasses four realistic domains with fake news samples generated through three manipulation approaches. Moreover, a Multi-modal news Detection and Reasoning langUage Model (M-DRUM) is presented not only to judge on the authenticity of multi-modal news, but also raise analytical reasoning about potential manipulations. On the feature extraction level, a cross-attention mechanism is employed to extract fine-grained fusion features from multi-modal inputs. On the reasoning level, a large vision-language model (LVLM) serves as the backbone to facilitate fact-related reasoning. A two-stage training framework is deployed to better activate the capacity of identification and reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) fake news detection models and powerful LVLMs like GPT-4 and LLaVA.</description>

Abstract: Digitalisation in education and its influence on teaching methods is the focus of this study, which examines the use of ChatGPT in a role-playing game used in the Cloud Computing Engineering Master's programme at the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland. The aim of the study was to analyse the impact of AI-based simulations on students' learning experience. Based on Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, ChatGPT was used to give students a deeper understanding of strategic decision-making processes in simulated business scenarios. The methodological approach included role-playing and qualitative content analysis of 20 student reflections. The findings suggest that ChatGPT enhances students' engagement, critical thinking, and communication skills, in addition to contributing to the effective application of theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, simulations can contribute to the effective application of theoretical knowledge. The results underscore the significance of adaptive teaching approaches in promoting digital literacy and equipping learners for the digital workplace. The integration of AI into curricula and the need for ongoing innovation in higher education are also emphasised as a means of guaranteeing excellent, future-focused instruction. The findings highlight the potential of AI and ChatGPT in particular, as an innovative cutting-edge educational tool that can both enhance the learning experience and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through education.</description>

      <title>Integrate the Essence and Eliminate the Dross: Fine-Grained Self-Consistency for Free-Form Language Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency (SC), leveraging multiple samples from LLMs, shows significant gains on various reasoning tasks but struggles with free-form generation due to the difficulty of aggregating answers. Its variants, UCS and USC, rely on sample selection or voting mechanisms to improve output quality. These methods, however, face limitations due to their inability to fully utilize the nuanced consensus knowledge present within multiple candidate samples, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. We propose Fine-Grained Self-Consistency (FSC) to addresses these limitations by extracting and integrating segment-level commonalities from candidate samples, enhancing the performance of LLMs both in open-ended and reasoning tasks. Based on this, we present two additional strategies: candidate filtering, which enhances overall quality by identifying highly similar candidate sets, and merging, which reduces input token requirements by combining similar samples. The effectiveness of FSC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various tasks, including summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. The results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods, showcasing the potential of FSC to optimize output quality by effectively synthesizing fine-grained consensus knowledge from multiple samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the recently proposed neuro-symbolic Differentiable Tree Machine, which learns tree operations using a combination of transformers and Tensor Product Representations. We investigate the architecture and propose two key components. We first remove a series of different transformer layers that are used in every step by introducing a mixture of experts. This results in a Differentiable Tree Experts model with a constant number of parameters for any arbitrary number of steps in the computation, compared to the previous method in the Differentiable Tree Machine with a linear growth. Given this flexibility in the number of steps, we additionally propose a new termination algorithm to provide the model the power to choose how many steps to make automatically. The resulting Terminating Differentiable Tree Experts model sluggishly learns to predict the number of steps without an oracle. It can do so while maintaining the learning capabilities of the model, converging to the optimal amount of steps.</description>

      <title>Are Data Augmentation Methods in Named Entity Recognition Applicable for Uncertainty Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of data augmentation on confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. For the future advance of NER in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance, it is essential to achieve accurate predictions with calibrated confidence when applying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), as a real-world application. However, DNNs are prone to miscalibration, which limits their applicability. Moreover, existing methods for calibration and uncertainty estimation are computational expensive. Our investigation in NER found that data augmentation improves calibration and uncertainty in cross-genre and cross-lingual setting, especially in-domain setting. Furthermore, we showed that the calibration for NER tends to be more effective when the perplexity of the sentences generated by data augmentation is lower, and that increasing the size of the augmentation further improves calibration and uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining accurate estimates of uncertainty in climate scenarios often requires generating large ensembles of high-resolution climate simulations, a computationally expensive and memory intensive process. To address this challenge, we train a novel generative deep learning approach on extensive sets of climate simulations. The model consists of two components: a variational autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates multiple ensemble members. We validate our model on the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble and show that it achieves good agreement with the original ensemble in terms of variability. By leveraging the latent space representation, our model can rapidly generate large ensembles on-the-fly with minimal memory requirements, which can significantly improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification in climate simulations.</description>

      <title>MARLIN: A Cloud Integrated Robotic Solution to Support Intralogistics in Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the service robot MARLIN and its integration with the K4R platform, a cloud system for complex AI applications in retail. At its core, this platform contains so-called semantic digital twins, a semantically annotated representation of the retail store. MARLIN continuously exchanges data with the K4R platform, improving the robot's capabilities in perception, autonomous navigation, and task planning. We exploit these capabilities in a retail intralogistics scenario, specifically by assisting store employees in stocking shelves. We demonstrate that MARLIN is able to update the digital representation of the retail store by detecting and classifying obstacles, autonomously planning and executing replenishment missions, adapting to unforeseen changes in the environment, and interacting with store employees. Experiments are conducted in simulation, in a laboratory environment, and in a real store. We also describe and evaluate a novel algorithm for autonomous navigation of articulated tractor-trailer systems. The algorithm outperforms the manufacturer's proprietary navigation approach and improves MARLIN's navigation capabilities in confined spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial processes generate vast amounts of time series data, yet extracting meaningful relationships and insights remains challenging. This paper introduces a framework for automated knowledge graph learning from time series data, specifically tailored for industrial applications. Our framework addresses the complexities inherent in industrial datasets, transforming them into knowledge graphs that improve decision-making, process optimization, and knowledge discovery. Additionally, it employs Granger causality to identify key attributes that can inform the design of predictive models. To illustrate the practical utility of our approach, we also present a motivating use case demonstrating the benefits of our framework in a real-world industrial scenario. Further, we demonstrate how the automated conversion of time series data into knowledge graphs can identify causal influences or dependencies between important process parameters.</description>

      <title>HRSAM: Efficiently Segment Anything in High-Resolution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has significantly advanced interactive segmentation but struggles with high-resolution images crucial for high-precision segmentation. This is primarily due to the quadratic space complexity of SAM-implemented attention and the length extrapolation issue in common global attention. This study proposes HRSAM that integrates Flash Attention and incorporates Plain, Shifted and newly proposed Cycle-scan Window (PSCWin) attention to address these issues. The shifted window attention is redesigned with padding to maintain consistent window sizes, enabling effective length extrapolation. The cycle-scan window attention adopts the recently developed State Space Models (SSMs) to ensure global information exchange with minimal computational overhead. Such window-based attention allows HRSAM to perform effective attention computations on scaled input images while maintaining low latency. Moreover, we further propose HRSAM++ that additionally employs a multi-scale strategy to enhance HRSAM's performance. The experiments on the high-precision segmentation datasets HQSeg44K and DAVIS show that high-resolution inputs enable the SAM-distilled HRSAM models to outperform the teacher model while maintaining lower latency. Compared to the SOTAs, HRSAM achieves a 1.56 improvement in interactive segmentation's NoC95 metric with only 31% of the latency. HRSAM++ further enhances the performance, achieving a 1.63 improvement in NoC95 with just 38% of the latency.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Perspective on Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data is prevalent in real-world machine learning applications, and new models for supervised learning of tabular data are frequently proposed. Comparative studies assessing the performance of models typically consist of model-centric evaluation setups with overly standardized data preprocessing. This paper demonstrates that such model-centric evaluations are biased, as real-world modeling pipelines often require dataset-specific preprocessing and feature engineering. Therefore, we propose a data-centric evaluation framework. We select 10 relevant datasets from Kaggle competitions and implement expert-level preprocessing pipelines for each dataset. We conduct experiments with different preprocessing pipelines and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) regimes to quantify the impact of model selection, HPO, feature engineering, and test-time adaptation. Our main findings are: 1. After dataset-specific feature engineering, model rankings change considerably, performance differences decrease, and the importance of model selection reduces. 2. Recent models, despite their measurable progress, still significantly benefit from manual feature engineering. This holds true for both tree-based models and neural networks. 3. While tabular data is typically considered static, samples are often collected over time, and adapting to distribution shifts can be important even in supposedly static data. These insights suggest that research efforts should be directed toward a data-centric perspective, acknowledging that tabular data requires feature engineering and often exhibits temporal characteristics.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Proxy Reward Model Construction with On-Policy and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), as a widely adopted approach in current large language model pipelines, is \textit{bottlenecked by the size of human preference data}. While traditional methods rely on offline preference dataset constructions, recent approaches have shifted towards online settings, where a learner uses a small amount of labeled seed data and a large pool of unlabeled prompts to iteratively construct new preference data through self-generated responses and high-quality reward/preference feedback. However, most current online algorithms still focus on preference labeling during policy model updating with given feedback oracles, which incurs significant expert query costs. \textit{We are the first to explore cost-effective proxy reward oracles construction strategies for further labeling preferences or rewards with extremely limited labeled data and expert query budgets}. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) on-policy query to avoid OOD and imbalance issues in seed data, and (2) active learning to select the most informative data for preference queries. Using these methods, we train a evaluation model with minimal expert-labeled data, which then effectively labels nine times more preference pairs for further RLHF training. For instance, our model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) gains around over 1% average improvement on AlpacaEval2, MMLU-5shot and MMLU-0shot, with only 1.7K query cost. Our methodology is orthogonal to other direct expert query-based strategies and therefore might be integrated with them to further reduce query costs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nearest Neighbor based Uncertainty Estimation for Natural Language Processing Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy prediction in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) is important for safety-critical applications in the real world. However, DNNs often suffer from uncertainty estimation, such as miscalibration. In particular, approaches that require multiple stochastic inference can mitigate this problem, but the expensive cost of inference makes them impractical. In this study, we propose $k$-Nearest Neighbor Uncertainty Estimation ($k$NN-UE), which is an uncertainty estimation method that uses the distances from the neighbors and label-existence ratio of neighbors. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and named entity recognition show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines or recent density-based methods in confidence calibration, selective prediction, and out-of-distribution detection. Moreover, our analyses indicate that introducing dimension reduction or approximate nearest neighbor search inspired by recent $k$NN-LM studies reduces the inference overhead without significantly degrading estimation performance when combined them appropriately.</description>

      <title>LlamAr &amp; GemmAr: Enhancing LLMs Through Arabic Instruction-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly impacted the natural language processing (NLP) field, particularly for the English language. These models have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The success of language models largely depends on the availability of high-quality instruction datasets, which consist of detailed task descriptions and corresponding responses that are essential for training the models to accurately address a variety of prompts. However, the availability and quality of these resources vary by language. While models perform well in English, they often struggle with languages like Arabic, due to the lack of datasets for fine-tuning Arabic-specific tasks. To address this issue, we introduce InstAr-500k, a new Arabic instruction dataset created by generating and collecting content that covers several domains and instruction types. We then assess this dataset by fine-tuning two open-source models, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-7B-IT, on several downstream tasks to scale improvements in their functionality. Based on multiple evaluations, our fine-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance on several Arabic NLP benchmarks. These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of our dataset in elevating the capabilities of language models for Arabic. Our instruction dataset bridges the performance gap between English and Arabic language models by providing resources that amplify Arabic NLP development. Building on this foundation, we developed two state-of-the-art models, LlamAr-8B and GemmAr-7B, which are specifically tuned to excel at a wide range of Arabic NLP tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most contemporary music tagging systems rely on large volumes of annotated data. As an alternative, we investigate the extent to which synthetically generated music excerpts can improve tagging systems when only small annotated collections are available. To this end, we release GTZAN-synth, a synthetic dataset that follows the taxonomy of the well-known GTZAN dataset while being ten times larger in data volume. We first observe that simply adding this synthetic dataset to the training split of GTZAN does not result into performance improvements. We then proceed to investigating domain adaptation, transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies for the task at hand and draw the conclusion that the last two options yield an increase in accuracy. Overall, the proposed approach can be considered as a first guide in a promising field for future research.</description>

      <title>Attack-Aware Noise Calibration for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale in terms of a privacy budget parameter $\epsilon$. This parameter is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risk, such as accuracy, or sensitivity and specificity of inference attacks against the privacy of the data. We demonstrate that this two-step procedure of first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget $\epsilon$, and then translating $\epsilon$ to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. We propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the intermediate step of choosing $\epsilon$. For a target attack risk, our approach significantly decreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than $\epsilon$, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy.</description>

Abstract: Rule-based adaptation is a foundational approach to self-adaptation, characterized by its human readability and rapid response. However, building high-performance and robust adaptation rules is often a challenge because it essentially involves searching the optimal design in a complex (variables) space. In response, this paper attempt to employ large language models (LLMs) as a optimizer to construct and optimize adaptation rules, leveraging the common sense and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. Preliminary experiments conducted in SWIM have validated the effectiveness and limitation of our method.</description>

      <title>How to Learn in a Noisy World? Self-Correcting the Real-World Data Noise on Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive amounts of web-mined parallel data contain large amounts of noise. Semantic misalignment, as the primary source of the noise, poses a challenge for training machine translation systems. In this paper, we first study the impact of real-world hard-to-detect misalignment noise by proposing a process to simulate the realistic misalignment controlled by semantic similarity. After quantitatively analyzing the impact of simulated misalignment on machine translation, we show the limited effectiveness of widely used pre-filters to improve the translation performance, underscoring the necessity of more fine-grained ways to handle data noise. By observing the increasing reliability of the model's self-knowledge for distinguishing misaligned and clean data at the token-level, we propose a self-correction approach which leverages the model's prediction distribution to revise the training supervision from the ground-truth data over training time. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our self-correction method not only improves translation performance in the presence of simulated misalignment noise but also proves effective for real-world noisy web-mined datasets across eight translation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce {\em generative monoculture}, a behavior observed in large language models (LLMs) characterized by a significant narrowing of model output diversity relative to available training data for a given task: for example, generating only positive book reviews for books with a mixed reception. While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., LLMs more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., LLMs refuse to share diverse opinions). As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of LLM output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time. We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the LLM's alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.</description>

      <title>PromptIntern: Saving Inference Costs by Internalizing Recurrent Prompt during Large Language Model Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have played a fundamental role in various natural language processing tasks with powerful prompt techniques. However, in real-world applications, there are often similar prompt components for repeated queries, which causes significant computational burdens during inference. Existing prompt compression and direct fine-tuning methods aim to tackle these challenges, yet they frequently struggle to strike an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance effectiveness, especially in complex tasks such as NL2Code. In this paper, we propose a novel method namely PromptIntern to internalize the prompt knowledge into model parameters via progressive fine-tuning. Our method enables LLMs to emulate the human learning process for a new task, where detailed templates and examples in a prompt are gradually internalized and phased out progressively as the model grows accustomed to the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces inference tokens over 90%, speedups inference by 4.2 times, and saves 88.3% monetary cost.</description>

Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world applications requires addressing a trade-off between asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and inference time. In this work, we demonstrate how to address this triple challenge by leveraging partial physical knowledge about the system dynamics. Our approach involves learning a physics-informed model to boost sample efficiency and generating imaginary trajectories from this model to learn a model-free policy and Q-function. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid planning strategy, combining the learned policy and Q-function with the learned model to enhance time efficiency in planning. Through practical demonstrations, we illustrate that our method improves the compromise between sample efficiency, time efficiency, and performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and solving mathematical problems, leading to advancements in various fields. We propose an LLM-embodied path planning framework for mobile agents, focusing on solving high-level coverage path planning issues and low-level control. Our proposed multi-layer architecture uses prompted LLMs in the path planning phase and integrates them with the mobile agents' low-level actuators. To evaluate the performance of various LLMs, we propose a coverage-weighted path planning metric to assess the performance of the embodied models. Our experiments show that the proposed framework improves LLMs' spatial inference abilities. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-layer framework significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of these tasks by leveraging the natural language understanding and generative capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments show that this framework can improve LLMs' 2D plane reasoning abilities and complete coverage path planning tasks. We also tested three LLM kernels: gpt-4o, gemini-1.5-flash, and claude-3.5-sonnet. The experimental results show that claude-3.5 can complete the coverage planning task in different scenarios, and its indicators are better than those of the other models.</description>

      <title>MTMamba: Enhancing Multi-Task Dense Scene Understanding by Mamba-Based Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task dense scene understanding, which learns a model for multiple dense prediction tasks, has a wide range of application scenarios. Modeling long-range dependency and enhancing cross-task interactions are crucial to multi-task dense prediction. In this paper, we propose MTMamba, a novel Mamba-based architecture for multi-task scene understanding. It contains two types of core blocks: self-task Mamba (STM) block and cross-task Mamba (CTM) block. STM handles long-range dependency by leveraging Mamba, while CTM explicitly models task interactions to facilitate information exchange across tasks. Experiments on NYUDv2 and PASCAL-Context datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MTMamba over Transformer-based and CNN-based methods. Notably, on the PASCAL-Context dataset, MTMamba achieves improvements of +2.08, +5.01, and +4.90 over the previous best method in the tasks of semantic segmentation, human parsing, and object boundary detection, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MMRAG) is a powerful approach to question-answering over multimodal documents. A key challenge with evaluating MMRAG is the paucity of high-quality datasets matching the question styles and modalities of interest. In light of this, we propose SMMQG, a synthetic data generation framework. SMMQG leverages interplay between a retriever, large language model (LLM) and large multimodal model (LMM) to generate question and answer pairs directly from multimodal documents, with the questions conforming to specified styles and modalities. We use SMMQG to generate an MMRAG dataset of 1024 questions over Wikipedia documents and evaluate state-of-the-art models using it, revealing insights into model performance that are attainable only through style- and modality-specific evaluation data. Next, we measure the quality of data produced by SMMQG via a human study. We find that the quality of our synthetic data is on par with the quality of the crowdsourced benchmark MMQA and that downstream evaluation results using both datasets strongly concur.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents price prediction models using Machine Learning algorithms augmented with Superforecasters predictions, aimed at enhancing investment decisions. Five Machine Learning models are built, including Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU, and a model built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. The models are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error to determine their predictive accuracy. Additionally, the paper suggests incorporating human intelligence by identifying Superforecasters and tracking their predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices . The predictions made by these users can further enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions when combined with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. Predicting the price of any commodity can be a significant task but predicting the price of a stock in the stock market deals with much more uncertainty. Recognising the limited knowledge and exposure to stocks among certain investors, this paper proposes price prediction models using Machine Learning algorithms. In this work, five Machine learning models are built using Bidirectional LSTM, ARIMA, a combination of CNN and LSTM, GRU and the last one is built using LSTM and GRU algorithms. Later these models are assessed using MAE scores to find which model is predicting with the highest accuracy. In addition to this, this paper also suggests the use of human intelligence to closely predict the shift in price patterns in the stock market The main goal is to identify Superforecasters and track their predictions to anticipate unpredictable shifts or changes in stock prices. By leveraging the combined power of Machine Learning and the Human Intelligence, predictive accuracy can be significantly increased.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of autonomous agents, ensuring safety and reliability in complex and dynamic environments remains a paramount challenge. Safe reinforcement learning addresses these concerns by introducing safety constraints, but still faces challenges in navigating intricate environments such as complex driving situations. To overcome these challenges, we present the safe constraint reward (Safe CoR) framework, a novel method that utilizes two types of expert demonstrations$\unicode{x2013}$reward expert demonstrations focusing on performance optimization and safe expert demonstrations prioritizing safety. By exploiting a constraint reward (CoR), our framework guides the agent to balance performance goals of reward sum with safety constraints. We test the proposed framework in diverse environments, including the safety gym, metadrive, and the real$\unicode{x2013}$world Jackal platform. Our proposed framework enhances the performance of algorithms by $39\%$ and reduces constraint violations by $88\%$ on the real-world Jackal platform, demonstrating the framework's efficacy. Through this innovative approach, we expect significant advancements in real-world performance, leading to transformative effects in the realm of safe and reliable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Footprints of Data in a Classifier Model: The Privacy Issues and Their Mitigation through Data Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The avalanche of AI deployment and its security-privacy concerns are two sides of the same coin. Article 17 of GDPR calls for the Right to Erasure; data has to be obliterated from a system to prevent its compromise. Extant research in this aspect focuses on effacing sensitive data attributes. However, several passive modes of data compromise are yet to be recognized and redressed. The embedding of footprints of training data in a prediction model is one such facet; the difference in performance quality in test and training data causes passive identification of data that have trained the model. This research focuses on addressing the vulnerability arising from the data footprints. The three main aspects are -- i] exploring the vulnerabilities of different classifiers (to segregate the vulnerable and the non-vulnerable ones), ii] reducing the vulnerability of vulnerable classifiers (through data obfuscation) to preserve model and data privacy, and iii] exploring the privacy-performance tradeoff to study the usability of the data obfuscation techniques. An empirical study is conducted on three datasets and eight classifiers to explore the above objectives. The results of the initial research identify the vulnerability in classifiers and segregate the vulnerable and non-vulnerable classifiers. The additional experiments on data obfuscation techniques reveal their utility to render data and model privacy and also their capability to chalk out a privacy-performance tradeoff in most scenarios. The results can aid the practitioners with their choice of classifiers in different scenarios and contexts.</description>

      <title>IFTT-PIN: A Self-Calibrating PIN-Entry Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalising an interface to the needs and preferences of a user often incurs additional interaction steps. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method that enables the personalising of an interface without the need for explicit calibration procedures, via a process we call self-calibration. A second-order effect of self-calibration is that an outside observer cannot easily infer what a user is trying to achieve because they cannot interpret the user's actions. To explore this security angle, we developed IFTT-PIN (If This Then PIN) as the first self-calibrating PIN-entry method. When using IFTT-PIN, users are free to choose any button for any meaning without ever explicitly communicating their choice to the machine. IFTT-PIN infers both the user's PIN and their preferred button mapping at the same time. This paper presents the concept, implementation, and interactive demonstrations of IFTT-PIN, as well as an evaluation against shoulder surfing attacks. Our study (N=24) shows that by adding self-calibration to an existing PIN entry method, IFTT-PIN statistically significantly decreased PIN attack decoding rate by ca. 8.5 times (p=1.1e-9), while only decreasing the PIN entry encoding rate by ca. 1.4 times (p=0.02), leading to a positive security-usability trade-off. IFTT-PIN's entry rate significantly improved 21 days after first exposure (p=3.6e-6) to the method, suggesting self-calibrating interfaces are memorable despite using an initially undefined user interface. Self-calibration methods might lead to novel opportunities for interaction that are more inclusive and versatile, a potentially interesting challenge for the community.

      <title>Learning Paradigms and Modelling Methodologies for Digital Twins in Process Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to the digital transformation of the process industry are Digital Twins (DTs), virtual replicas of physical manufacturing systems that combine sensor data with sophisticated data-based or physics-based models, or a combination thereof, to tackle a variety of industrial-relevant tasks like process monitoring, predictive control or decision support. The backbone of a DT, i.e. the concrete modelling methodologies and architectural frameworks supporting these models, are complex, diverse and evolve fast, necessitating a thorough understanding of the latest state-of-the-art methods and trends to stay on top of a highly competitive market. From a research perspective, despite the high research interest in reviewing various aspects of DTs, structured literature reports specifically focusing on unravelling the utilized learning paradigms (e.g. self-supervised learning) for DT-creation in the process industry are a novel contribution in this field. This study aims to address these gaps by (1) systematically analyzing the modelling methodologies (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network, Encoder-Decoder, Hidden Markov Model) and paradigms (e.g. data-driven, physics-based, hybrid) used for DT-creation; (2) assessing the utilized learning strategies (e.g. supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised); (3) analyzing the type of modelling task (e.g. regression, classification, clustering); and (4) identifying the challenges and research gaps, as well as, discuss potential resolutions provided.</description>

      <title>FedIA: Federated Medical Image Segmentation with Heterogeneous Annotation Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a compelling paradigm for medical image segmentation, particularly in light of increasing privacy concerns. However, most of the existing research relies on relatively stringent assumptions regarding the uniformity and completeness of annotations across clients. Contrary to this, this paper highlights a prevalent challenge in medical practice: incomplete annotations. Such annotations can introduce incorrectly labeled pixels, potentially undermining the performance of neural networks in supervised learning. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel solution, named FedIA. Our insight is to conceptualize incomplete annotations as noisy data (\textit{i.e.}, low-quality data), with a focus on mitigating their adverse effects. We begin by evaluating the completeness of annotations at the client level using a designed indicator. Subsequently, we enhance the influence of clients with more comprehensive annotations and implement corrections for incomplete ones, thereby ensuring that models are trained on accurate data. Our method's effectiveness is validated through its superior performance on two extensively used medical image segmentation datasets, outperforming existing solutions. The code is available at https://github.com/HUSTxyy/FedIA.</description>

      <title>A Refreshed Similarity-based Upsampler for Direct High-Ratio Feature Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature upsampling is a fundamental and indispensable ingredient of almost all current network structures for image segmentation tasks. Recently, a popular similarity-based feature upsampling pipeline has been proposed, which utilizes a high-resolution feature as guidance to help upsample the low-resolution deep feature based on their local similarity. Albeit achieving promising performance, this pipeline has specific limitations: 1) HR query and LR key features are not well aligned; 2) the similarity between query-key features is computed based on the fixed inner product form; 3) neighbor selection is coarsely operated on LR features, resulting in mosaic artifacts. These shortcomings make the existing methods along this pipeline primarily applicable to hierarchical network architectures with iterative features as guidance and they are not readily extended to a broader range of structures, especially for a direct high-ratio upsampling. Against the issues, we meticulously optimize every methodological design. Specifically, we firstly propose an explicitly controllable query-key feature alignment from both semantic-aware and detail-aware perspectives, and then construct a parameterized paired central difference convolution block for flexibly calculating the similarity between the well-aligned query-key features. Besides, we develop a fine-grained neighbor selection strategy on HR features, which is simple yet effective for alleviating mosaic artifacts. Based on these careful designs, we systematically construct a refreshed similarity-based feature upsampling framework named ReSFU. Extensive experiments substantiate that our proposed ReSFU is finely applicable to various types of architectures in a direct high-ratio upsampling manner, and consistently achieves satisfactory performance on different segmentation applications, showing superior generality and ease of deployment.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Augmentation for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation methods often struggle with performance declines in adverse weather conditions. Previous research has addressed this issue by simulating adverse weather or employing universal data augmentation during training. However, these methods lack a detailed analysis and understanding of how adverse weather negatively affects LiDAR semantic segmentation performance. Motivated by this issue, we identified key factors of adverse weather and conducted a toy experiment to pinpoint the main causes of performance degradation: (1) Geometric perturbation due to refraction caused by fog or droplets in the air and (2) Point drop due to energy absorption and occlusions. Based on these findings, we propose new strategic data augmentation techniques. First, we introduced a Selective Jittering (SJ) that jitters points in the random range of depth (or angle) to mimic geometric perturbation. Additionally, we developed a Learnable Point Drop (LPD) to learn vulnerable erase patterns with Deep Q-Learning Network to approximate the point drop phenomenon from adverse weather conditions. Without precise weather simulation, these techniques strengthen the LiDAR semantic segmentation model by exposing it to vulnerable conditions identified by our data-centric analysis. Experimental results confirmed the suitability of the proposed data augmentation methods for enhancing robustness against adverse weather conditions. Our method attains a remarkable 39.5 mIoU on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by over 5.4%p, tripling the improvement over the baseline compared to previous methods achieved.</description>

      <title>Strategic Demand-Planning in Wireless Networks: Can Generative-AI Save Spectrum and Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications advance hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence (AI), indicating an interconnected advancement where each facilitates and benefits from the other. This synergy is particularly evident in the development of the sixth-generation technology standard for mobile networks (6G), envisioned to be AI-native. Generative-AI (GenAI), a novel technology capable of producing various types of outputs, including text, images, and videos, offers significant potential for wireless communications, with its distinctive features. Traditionally, conventional AI techniques have been employed for predictions, classifications, and optimization, while GenAI has more to offer. This article introduces the concept of strategic demand-planning through demand-labeling, demand-shaping, and demand-rescheduling. Accordingly, GenAI is proposed as a powerful tool to facilitate demand-shaping in wireless networks. More specifically, GenAI is used to compress and convert the content of various kind (e.g., from a higher bandwidth mode to a lower one, such as from a video to text), which subsequently enhances performance of wireless networks in various usage scenarios such as cell-switching, user association and load balancing, interference management, and disaster scenarios management. Therefore, GenAI can serve a function in saving energy and spectrum in wireless networks. With recent advancements in AI, including sophisticated algorithms like large-language-models and the development of more powerful hardware built exclusively for AI tasks, such as AI accelerators, the concept of demand-planning, particularly demand-shaping through GenAI, becomes increasingly relevant. Furthermore, recent efforts to make GenAI accessible on devices, such as user terminals, make the implementation of this concept even more straightforward and feasible.</description>

      <title>Semantically Guided Representation Learning For Action Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action anticipation is the task of forecasting future activity from a partially observed sequence of events. However, this task is exposed to intrinsic future uncertainty and the difficulty of reasoning upon interconnected actions. Unlike previous works that focus on extrapolating better visual and temporal information, we concentrate on learning action representations that are aware of their semantic interconnectivity based on prototypical action patterns and contextual co-occurrences. To this end, we propose the novel Semantically Guided Representation Learning (S-GEAR) framework. S-GEAR learns visual action prototypes and leverages language models to structure their relationship, inducing semanticity. To gather insights on S-GEAR's effectiveness, we test it on four action anticipation benchmarks, obtaining improved results compared to previous works: +3.5, +2.7, and +3.5 absolute points on Top-1 Accuracy on Epic-Kitchen 55, EGTEA Gaze+ and 50 Salads, respectively, and +0.8 on Top-5 Recall on Epic-Kitchens 100. We further observe that S-GEAR effectively transfers the geometric associations between actions from language to visual prototypes. Finally, S-GEAR opens new research frontiers in anticipation tasks by demonstrating the intricate impact of action semantic interconnectivity.</description>

      <title>VFIMamba: Video Frame Interpolation with State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-frame modeling is pivotal in generating intermediate frames for video frame interpolation (VFI). Current approaches predominantly rely on convolution or attention-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. Recently, Selective State Space Models (S6) have emerged, tailored specifically for long sequence modeling, offering both linear complexity and data-dependent modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose VFIMamba, a novel frame interpolation method for efficient and dynamic inter-frame modeling by harnessing the S6 model. Our approach introduces the Mixed-SSM Block (MSB), which initially rearranges tokens from adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion and subsequently applies multi-directional S6 modeling. This design facilitates the efficient transmission of information across frames while upholding linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy that progressively cultivates proficiency in modeling inter-frame dynamics across varying motion magnitudes, fully unleashing the potential of the S6 model. Experimental findings showcase that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly excelling in high-resolution scenarios. In particular, on the X-TEST dataset, VFIMamba demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of 0.80 dB for 4K frames and 0.96 dB for 2K frames.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Transliteration in In-Context Learning for Low-resource Languages Written in Non-Latin Scripts</title>

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages across various tasks through few-shot or even zero-shot in-context learning (ICL). However, their performance often does not transfer well to low-resource languages, especially those written in non-Latin scripts. Inspired by recent work that leverages transliteration in encoder-only models, we investigate whether transliteration is also effective in improving LLMs' performance for low-resource languages written in non-Latin scripts. To this end, we propose three prompt templates, where the target-language text is represented in (1) its original script, (2) Latin script, or (3) both. We apply these methods to several representative LLMs of different sizes on various tasks including text classification and sequential labeling. Our findings show that the effectiveness of transliteration varies by task type and model size. For instance, all models benefit from transliterations for sequential labeling (with increases of up to 25%).</description>

      <title>CALICO: Confident Active Learning with Integrated Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing use of deep learning in safety-critical applications, such as medical imaging, has raised concerns about limited labeled data, where this demand is amplified as model complexity increases, posing hurdles for domain experts to annotate data. In response to this, active learning (AL) is used to efficiently train models with limited annotation costs. In the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), AL often uses confidence or probability outputs as a score for selecting the most informative samples. However, modern DNNs exhibit unreliable confidence outputs, making calibration essential. We propose an AL framework that self-calibrates the confidence used for sample selection during the training process, referred to as Confident Active Learning with Integrated CalibratiOn (CALICO). CALICO incorporates the joint training of a classifier and an energy-based model, instead of the standard softmax-based classifier. This approach allows for simultaneous estimation of the input data distribution and the class probabilities during training, improving calibration without needing an additional labeled dataset. Experimental results showcase improved classification performance compared to a softmax-based classifier with fewer labeled samples. Furthermore, the calibration stability of the model is observed to depend on the prior class distribution of the data.</description>

      <title>RVISA: Reasoning and Verification for Implicit Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an increasing social demand for fine-grained sentiment analysis (SA), implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) poses a significant challenge with the absence of salient cue words in expressions. It necessitates reliable reasoning to understand how the sentiment is aroused and thus determine implicit sentiments. In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Encoder-Decoder (ED) LLMs have gained popularity to serve as backbone models for SA applications, considering impressive text comprehension and reasoning ability among diverse tasks. On the other hand, Decoder-only (DO) LLMs exhibit superior natural language generation and in-context learning capabilities. However, their responses may contain misleading or inaccurate information. To identify implicit sentiment with reliable reasoning, this study proposes RVISA, a two-stage reasoning framework that harnesses the generation ability of DO LLMs and the reasoning ability of ED LLMs to train an enhanced reasoner. Specifically, we adopt three-hop reasoning prompting to explicitly furnish sentiment elements as cues. The generated rationales are utilized to fine-tune an ED LLM into a skilled reasoner. Additionally, we develop a straightforward yet effective verification mechanism to ensure the reliability of the reasoning learning. We evaluated the proposed method on two benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results in ISA performance.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scalable, Energy-Efficient Non-element-wise Matrix Multiplication on FPGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Neural Network (NN) architectures heavily rely on vast numbers of multiply-accumulate arithmetic operations, constituting the predominant computational cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-throughput, scalable and energy efficient non-element-wise matrix multiplication unit on FPGAs as a basic component of the NNs. We firstly streamline inter-layer and intra-layer redundancies of MADDNESS algorithm, a LUT-based approximate matrix multiplication, to design a fast, efficient scalable approximate matrix multiplication module termed "Approximate Multiplication Unit (AMU)". The AMU optimizes LUT-based matrix multiplications further through dedicated memory management and access design, decoupling computational overhead from input resolution and boosting FPGA-based NN accelerator efficiency significantly. The experimental results show that using our AMU achieves up to 9x higher throughput and 112x higher energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art solutions for the FPGA-based Quantised Neural Network (QNN) accelerators.</description>

      <title>SafaRi:Adaptive Sequence Transformer for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to provide a segmentation mask of the target object in an image referred to by the text (i.e., referring expression). Existing methods require large-scale mask annotations. Moreover, such approaches do not generalize well to unseen/zero-shot scenarios. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a weakly-supervised bootstrapping architecture for RES with several new algorithmic innovations. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that considers only a fraction of both mask and box annotations (shown in Figure 1 and Table 1) for training. To enable principled training of models in such low-annotation settings, improve image-text region-level alignment, and further enhance spatial localization of the target object in the image, we propose Cross-modal Fusion with Attention Consistency module. For automatic pseudo-labeling of unlabeled samples, we introduce a novel Mask Validity Filtering routine based on a spatially aware zero-shot proposal scoring approach. Extensive experiments show that with just 30% annotations, our model SafaRi achieves 59.31 and 48.26 mIoUs as compared to 58.93 and 48.19 mIoUs obtained by the fully-supervised SOTA method SeqTR respectively on RefCOCO+@testA and RefCOCO+testB datasets. SafaRi also outperforms SeqTR by 11.7% (on RefCOCO+testA) and 19.6% (on RefCOCO+testB) in a fully-supervised setting and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in unseen/zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Code Clone Detection Capability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to assess the performance of two advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in the task of code clone detection. The evaluation involves testing the models on a variety of code pairs of different clone types and levels of similarity, sourced from two datasets: BigCloneBench (human-made) and GPTCloneBench (LLM-generated). Findings from the study indicate that GPT-4 consistently surpasses GPT-3.5 across all clone types. A correlation was observed between the GPTs' accuracy at identifying code clones and code similarity, with both GPT models exhibiting low effectiveness in detecting the most complex Type-4 code clones. Additionally, GPT models demonstrate a higher performance identifying code clones in LLM-generated code compared to humans-generated code. However, they do not reach impressive accuracy. These results emphasize the imperative for ongoing enhancements in LLM capabilities, particularly in the recognition of code clones and in mitigating their predisposition towards self-generated code clones--which is likely to become an issue as software engineers are more numerous to leverage LLM-enabled code generation and code refactoring tools.</description>

      <title>Face Reconstruction Transfer Attack as Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the vulnerability of face recognition systems to malicious attacks is of critical importance. Previous works have focused on reconstructing face images that can penetrate a targeted verification system. Even in the white-box scenario, however, naively reconstructed images misrepresent the identity information, hence the attacks are easily neutralized once the face system is updated or changed. In this paper, we aim to reconstruct face images which are capable of transferring face attacks on unseen encoders. We term this problem as Face Reconstruction Transfer Attack (FRTA) and show that it can be formulated as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem. Inspired by its OOD nature, we propose to solve FRTA by Averaged Latent Search and Unsupervised Validation with pseudo target (ALSUV). To strengthen the reconstruction attack on OOD unseen encoders, ALSUV reconstructs the face by searching the latent of amortized generator StyleGAN2 through multiple latent optimization, latent optimization trajectory averaging, and unsupervised validation with a pseudo target. We demonstrate the efficacy and generalization of our method on widely used face datasets, accompanying it with extensive ablation studies and visually, qualitatively, and quantitatively analyses. The source code will be released.</description>

      <title>Meta 3D TextureGen: Fast and Consistent Texture Generation for 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent availability and adaptability of text-to-image models has sparked a new era in many related domains that benefit from the learned text priors as well as high-quality and fast generation capabilities, one of which is texture generation for 3D objects. Although recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results by using text-to-image networks, the combination of global consistency, quality, and speed, which is crucial for advancing texture generation to real-world applications, remains elusive. To that end, we introduce Meta 3D TextureGen: a new feedforward method comprised of two sequential networks aimed at generating high-quality and globally consistent textures for arbitrary geometries of any complexity degree in less than 20 seconds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in quality and speed by conditioning a text-to-image model on 3D semantics in 2D space and fusing them into a complete and high-resolution UV texture map, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In addition, we introduce a texture enhancement network that is capable of up-scaling any texture by an arbitrary ratio, producing 4k pixel resolution textures.</description>

      <title>Meta 3D AssetGen: Text-to-Mesh Generation with High-Quality Geometry, Texture, and PBR Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Meta 3D AssetGen (AssetGen), a significant advancement in text-to-3D generation which produces faithful, high-quality meshes with texture and material control. Compared to works that bake shading in the 3D object's appearance, AssetGen outputs physically-based rendering (PBR) materials, supporting realistic relighting. AssetGen generates first several views of the object with factored shaded and albedo appearance channels, and then reconstructs colours, metalness and roughness in 3D, using a deferred shading loss for efficient supervision. It also uses a sign-distance function to represent 3D shape more reliably and introduces a corresponding loss for direct shape supervision. This is implemented using fused kernels for high memory efficiency. After mesh extraction, a texture refinement transformer operating in UV space significantly improves sharpness and details. AssetGen achieves 17% improvement in Chamfer Distance and 40% in LPIPS over the best concurrent work for few-view reconstruction, and a human preference of 72% over the best industry competitors of comparable speed, including those that support PBR.

      <title>Predicting vs. Acting: A Trade-off Between World Modeling &amp; Agent Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RLHF-aligned LMs have shown unprecedented ability on both benchmarks and long-form text generation, yet they struggle with one foundational task: next-token prediction. As RLHF models become agent models aimed at interacting with humans, they seem to lose their world modeling -- the ability to predict what comes next in arbitrary documents, which is the foundational training objective of the Base LMs that RLHF adapts.
  Besides empirically demonstrating this trade-off, we propose a potential explanation: to perform coherent long-form generation, RLHF models restrict randomness via implicit blueprints. In particular, RLHF models concentrate probability on sets of anchor spans that co-occur across multiple generations for the same prompt, serving as textual scaffolding but also limiting a model's ability to generate documents that do not include these spans. We study this trade-off on the most effective current agent models, those aligned with RLHF, while exploring why this may remain a fundamental trade-off between models that act and those that predict, even as alignment techniques improve.</description>

Abstract: Today, hate speech classification from Arabic tweets has drawn the attention of several researchers. Many systems and techniques have been developed to resolve this classification task. Nevertheless, two of the major challenges faced in this context are the limited performance and the problem of imbalanced data. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning based on previously manually labeled. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset by classifying Arabic tweets into 5 distinct classes: non-hate, general hate, racial, religious, or sexism. Experimental results show that: (1) ensemble learning based on pre-trained language models outperforms existing related works; (2) Our proposed data augmentation improves the accuracy results of hate speech detection from Arabic tweets and outperforms existing related works. Our main contribution is the achievement of encouraging results in Arabic hate speech detection.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive results on complex tasks but struggles in multi-task settings with different embodiments. World models offer scalability by learning a simulation of the environment, yet they often rely on inefficient gradient-free optimization methods. We introduce Policy learning with large World Models (PWM), a novel model-based RL algorithm that learns continuous control policies from large multi-task world models. By pre-training the world model on offline data and using it for first-order gradient policy learning, PWM effectively solves tasks with up to 152 action dimensions and outperforms methods using ground-truth dynamics. Additionally, PWM scales to an 80-task setting, achieving up to 27% higher rewards than existing baselines without the need for expensive online planning.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite being successful, exhibit limited generality and often fall short when compared to specialized models. Recently, LLM-based agents have been developed to address these challenges by selecting appropriate specialized models as tools based on user inputs. However, such advancements have not been extensively explored within the medical domain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first agent explicitly designed for the medical field, named \textbf{M}ulti-modal \textbf{Med}ical \textbf{Agent} (MMedAgent). We curate an instruction-tuning dataset comprising six medical tools solving seven tasks, enabling the agent to choose the most suitable tools for a given task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMedAgent achieves superior performance across a variety of medical tasks compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods and even the closed-source model, GPT-4o. Furthermore, MMedAgent exhibits efficiency in updating and integrating new medical tools.</description>

      <title>RankRAG: Unifying Context Ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically utilize the top-k contexts from a retriever in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.</description>

      <title>Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Neurocache, an approach to extend the effective context size of large language models (LLMs) using an external vector cache to store its past states. Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an efficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon previous methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size; (2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference speed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which improves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments show the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and for pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the cache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and show improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning tasks.

      <title>Magic Insert: Style-Aware Drag-and-Drop</title>

Abstract: We present Magic Insert, a method for dragging-and-dropping subjects from a user-provided image into a target image of a different style in a physically plausible manner while matching the style of the target image. This work formalizes the problem of style-aware drag-and-drop and presents a method for tackling it by addressing two sub-problems: style-aware personalization and realistic object insertion in stylized images. For style-aware personalization, our method first fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model using LoRA and learned text tokens on the subject image, and then infuses it with a CLIP representation of the target style. For object insertion, we use Bootstrapped Domain Adaption to adapt a domain-specific photorealistic object insertion model to the domain of diverse artistic styles. Overall, the method significantly outperforms traditional approaches such as inpainting. Finally, we present a dataset, SubjectPlop, to facilitate evaluation and future progress in this area.

      <title>Semiotics Networks Representing Perceptual Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every day, humans perceive objects and communicate these perceptions through various channels. In this paper, we present a computational model designed to track and simulate the perception of objects, as well as their representations as conveyed in communication.
  We delineate two fundamental components of our internal representation, termed "observed" and "seen", which we correlate with established concepts in computer vision, namely encoding and decoding. These components are integrated into semiotic networks, which simulate perceptual inference of object perception and human communication.
  Our model of object perception by a person allows us to define object perception by {\em a network}. We demonstrate this with an example of an image baseline classifier by constructing a new network that includes the baseline classifier and an additional layer. This layer produces the images "perceived" by the entire network, transforming it into a perceptualized image classifier. This facilitates visualization of the acquired network.
  Within our network, the image representations become more efficient for classification tasks when they are assembled and randomized. In our experiments, the perceptualized network outperformed the baseline classifier on MNIST training databases consisting of a restricted number of images.
  Our model is not limited to persons and can be applied to any system featuring a loop involving the processing from "internal" to "external" representations.</description>

      <title>HGOT: Hierarchical Graph of Thoughts for Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning in Factuality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in numerous applications, the challenge of factuality and the propensity for hallucinations has emerged as a significant concern. To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments indicate that HGOT excels as a versatile approach, outperforming competing models in FEVER by up to $7\%$ and matching leading models such as Retrieve-then-Read in Open-SQuAD, and DSP in HotPotQA, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing LLMs' factuality.</description>

      <title>Shall We Team Up: Exploring Spontaneous Cooperation of Competing LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.</description>

      <title>Cradle: Empowering Foundation Agents Towards General Computer Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success in specific scenarios, existing foundation agents still struggle to generalize across various virtual scenarios, mainly due to the dramatically different encapsulations of environments with manually designed observation and action spaces. To handle this issue, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting to restrict foundation agents to interact with software through the most unified and standardized interface, i.e., using screenshots as input and keyboard and mouse actions as output. We introduce Cradle, a modular and flexible LMM-powered framework, as a preliminary attempt towards GCC. Enhanced by six key modules, Cradle can understand input screenshots and output executable code for low-level keyboard and mouse control after high-level planning, so that Cradle can interact with any software and complete long-horizon complex tasks without relying on any built-in APIs. Experimental results show that Cradle exhibits remarkable generalizability and impressive performance across four previously unexplored commercial video games, five software applications, and a comprehensive benchmark, OSWorld. Cradle is the first to enable foundation agents to follow the main storyline and complete 40-minute-long real missions in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2). Cradle can also create a city of a thousand people in Cities: Skylines, farm and harvest parsnips in Stardew Valley, and trade and bargain with a maximal weekly total profit of 87% in Dealer's Life 2. Cradle can not only operate daily software, like Chrome, Outlook, and Feishu, but also edit images and videos using Meitu and CapCut. Cradle greatly extends the reach of foundation agents by enabling the easy conversion of any software, especially complex games, into benchmarks to evaluate agents' various abilities and facilitate further data collection, thus paving the way for generalist agents.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design and Implementation of an Open-source Emulation Platform for User-Centric Shared E-mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rising concern over transportation emissions and pollution on a global scale, shared electric mobility services like E-cars, E-bikes, and E-scooters have emerged as promising solutions to mitigate these pressing challenges. However, existing shared E-mobility services exhibit critical design deficiencies, including insufficient service integration, imprecise energy consumption forecasting, limited scalability and geographical coverage, and a notable absence of a user-centric perspective, particularly in the context of multi-modal transportation. More importantly, there is no consolidated open-source platform which could benefit the E-mobility research community. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an open-source platform for shared E-mobility. The proposed platform, with an agent-in-the-loop approach and modular architecture, is tailored to diverse user preferences and offers enhanced customization. We demonstrate the viability of this platform by providing a comprehensive analysis for integrated multi-modal route-optimization in diverse scenarios of energy availability, user preferences and E-mobility tools placement for which we use modified Ant Colony Optimization algorithm so called Multi-Model Energy Constrained ACO (MMEC-ACO) and Q-Learning algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that Q-learning achieves significantly better performance in terms of travel time cost for more than 90\% of the instances as compared to MMEC-ACO for different scenarios including energy availability, user preference and E-mobility tools distribution. For a fixed (O, D) pair, the average execution time to achieve optimal time cost solution for MMEC-ACO is less than 2 seconds, while Q-learning reaches an optimal time cost in 20 seconds on average. For a run-time of 2 seconds, Q-learning still achieves a better optimal time cost with a 20\% reduction over MMEC-ACO's time cost.</description>

Abstract: The analysis of the field traps where the mosquitoes insert their eggs is vital to check that the sterile insect technique (SIT) is working properly. This is because the number of hatched eggs may indicate that the sterile males are not competing with the wild ones. Nowadays, the study of the traps is done manually by microscope and is very time-consuming and prone to human error. This paper presents an automatic trap survey. For this purpose, a device has been designed that automatically scans the slat obtaining different overlapping photos. Subsequently, the images are analyzed by a Mask-RCNN neural network that segments the eggs and classifies them into 2 classes: full or hatch</description>

      <title>Artificial Leviathan: Exploring Social Evolution of LLM Agents Through the Lens of Hobbesian Social Contract Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for computational social science research at scale. Building upon prior explorations of LLM agent design, our work introduces a simulated agent society where complex social relationships dynamically form and evolve over time. Agents are imbued with psychological drives and placed in a sandbox survival environment. We conduct an evaluation of the agent society through the lens of Thomas Hobbes's seminal Social Contract Theory (SCT). We analyze whether, as the theory postulates, agents seek to escape a brutish "state of nature" by surrendering rights to an absolute sovereign in exchange for order and security. Our experiments unveil an alignment: Initially, agents engage in unrestrained conflict, mirroring Hobbes's depiction of the state of nature. However, as the simulation progresses, social contracts emerge, leading to the authorization of an absolute sovereign and the establishment of a peaceful commonwealth founded on mutual cooperation. This congruence between our LLM agent society's evolutionary trajectory and Hobbes's theoretical account indicates LLMs' capability to model intricate social dynamics and potentially replicate forces that shape human societies. By enabling such insights into group behavior and emergent societal phenomena, LLM-driven multi-agent simulations, while unable to simulate all the nuances of human behavior, may hold potential for advancing our understanding of social structures, group dynamics, and complex human systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying patient cohorts is fundamental to numerous healthcare tasks, including clinical trial recruitment and retrospective studies. Current cohort retrieval methods in healthcare organizations rely on automated queries of structured data combined with manual curation, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often yield low-quality results. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and information retrieval (IR) offer promising avenues to revolutionize these systems. Major challenges include managing extensive eligibility criteria and handling the longitudinal nature of unstructured Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) while ensuring that the solution remains cost-effective for real-world application. This paper introduces a new task, Automatic Cohort Retrieval (ACR), and evaluates the performance of LLMs and commercial, domain-specific neuro-symbolic approaches. We provide a benchmark task, a query dataset, an EMR dataset, and an evaluation framework. Our findings underscore the necessity for efficient, high-quality ACR systems capable of longitudinal reasoning across extensive patient databases.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Exhibit Cognitive Dissonance? Studying the Difference Between Revealed Beliefs and Stated Answers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompting and Multiple Choices Questions (MCQ) have become the preferred approach to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), due to their ease of manipulation and evaluation. Such experimental appraisals have pointed toward the LLMs' apparent ability to perform causal reasoning or to grasp uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate whether these abilities are measurable outside of tailored prompting and MCQ by reformulating these issues as direct text completion - the foundation of LLMs. To achieve this goal, we define scenarios with multiple possible outcomes and we compare the prediction made by the LLM through prompting (their Stated Answer) to the probability distributions they compute over these outcomes during next token prediction (their Revealed Belief). Our findings suggest that the Revealed Belief of LLMs significantly differs from their Stated Answer and hint at multiple biases and misrepresentations that their beliefs may yield in many scenarios and outcomes. As text completion is at the core of LLMs, these results suggest that common evaluation methods may only provide a partial picture and that more research is needed to assess the extent and nature of their capabilities.</description>

      <title>Are There Exceptions to Goodhart's Law? On the Moral Justification of Fairness-Aware Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness-aware machine learning (fair-ml) techniques are algorithmic interventions designed to ensure that individuals who are affected by the predictions of a machine learning model are treated fairly. The problem is often posed as an optimization problem, where the objective is to achieve high predictive performance under a quantitative fairness constraint. However, any attempt to design a fair-ml algorithm must assume a world where Goodhart's law has an exception: when a fairness measure becomes an optimization constraint, it does not cease to be a good measure. In this paper, we argue that fairness measures are particularly sensitive to Goodhart's law. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we present a framework for moral reasoning about the justification of fairness metrics. In contrast to existing work, our framework incorporates the belief that whether a distribution of outcomes is fair, depends not only on the cause of inequalities but also on what moral claims decision subjects have to receive a particular benefit or avoid a burden. We use the framework to distil moral and empirical assumptions under which particular fairness metrics correspond to a fair distribution of outcomes. Second, we explore the extent to which employing fairness metrics as a constraint in a fair-ml algorithm is morally justifiable, exemplified by the fair-ml algorithm introduced by Hardt et al. (2016). We illustrate that enforcing a fairness metric through a fair-ml algorithm often does not result in the fair distribution of outcomes that motivated its use and can even harm the individuals the intervention was intended to protect.</description>

      <title>Knowledge of Knowledge: Exploring Known-Unknowns Uncertainty with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of understanding their knowledge and uncertainty over questions. Specifically, we focus on addressing known-unknown questions, characterized by high uncertainty due to the absence of definitive answers. To facilitate our study, we collect a new dataset with Known-Unknown Questions (KUQ) and establish a categorization framework to clarify the origins of uncertainty in such queries. Subsequently, we examine the performance of open-source LLMs, fine-tuned using this dataset, in distinguishing between known and unknown queries within open-ended question-answering scenarios. The fine-tuned models demonstrated a significant improvement, achieving a considerable increase in F1-score relative to their pre-fine-tuning state. Through a comprehensive analysis, we reveal insights into the models' improved uncertainty articulation and their consequent efficacy in multi-agent debates. These findings help us understand how LLMs can be trained to identify and express uncertainty, improving our knowledge of how they understand and express complex or unclear information.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems help people find relevant content in a personalized way. One main promise of such systems is that they are able to increase the visibility of items in the long tail, i.e., the lesser-known items in a catalogue. Existing research, however, suggests that in many situations todays recommendation algorithms instead exhibit a popularity bias, meaning that they often focus on rather popular items in their recommendations. Such a bias may not only lead to the limited value of the recommendations for consumers and providers in the short run, but it may also cause undesired reinforcement effects over time. In this paper, we discuss the potential reasons for popularity bias and review existing approaches to detect, quantify and mitigate popularity bias in recommender systems. Our survey, therefore, includes both an overview of the computational metrics used in the literature as well as a review of the main technical approaches to reduce the bias. Furthermore, we critically discuss todays literature, where we observe that the research is almost entirely based on computational experiments and on certain assumptions regarding the practical effects of including long-tail items in the recommendations.</description>

      <title>APACE: AlphaFold2 and advanced computing as a service for accelerated discovery in biophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of protein 3D structure from amino acid sequence is a computational grand challenge in biophysics, and plays a key role in robust protein structure prediction algorithms, from drug discovery to genome interpretation. The advent of AI models, such as AlphaFold, is revolutionizing applications that depend on robust protein structure prediction algorithms. To maximize the impact, and ease the usability, of these novel AI tools we introduce APACE, AlphaFold2 and advanced computing as a service, a novel computational framework that effectively handles this AI model and its TB-size database to conduct accelerated protein structure prediction analyses in modern supercomputing environments. We deployed APACE in the Delta and Polaris supercomputers, and quantified its performance for accurate protein structure predictions using four exemplar proteins: 6AWO, 6OAN, 7MEZ, and 6D6U. Using up to 300 ensembles, distributed across 200 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we found that APACE is up to two orders of magnitude faster than off-the-self AlphaFold2 implementations, reducing time-to-solution from weeks to minutes. This computational approach may be readily linked with robotics laboratories to automate and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09520v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2nd International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense was held at the Florida Institute of Technology, Florida. This workshop was organized to share research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats.
  Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time.
  The workshop was comprised of invited keynote talks, technical presentations and a panel discussion about how AI/ML can enable autonomous mitigation of current and future cyber attacks. Workshop submissions were peer reviewed by a panel of domain experts with a proceedings consisting of six technical articles exploring challenging problems of critical importance to national and global security. Participation in this workshop offered new opportunities to stimulate research and innovation in the emerging domain of adaptive and autonomous cyber defense.</description>

      <title>Logistics Hub Location Optimization: A K-Means and P-Median Model Hybrid Approach Using Road Network Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logistic hubs play a pivotal role in the last-mile delivery distance; even a slight increment in distance negatively impacts the business of the e-commerce industry while also increasing its carbon footprint. The growth of this industry, particularly after Covid-19, has further intensified the need for optimized allocation of resources in an urban environment. In this study, we use a hybrid approach to optimize the placement of logistic hubs. The approach sequentially employs different techniques. Initially, delivery points are clustered using K-Means in relation to their spatial locations. The clustering method utilizes road network distances as opposed to Euclidean distances. Non-road network-based approaches have been avoided since they lead to erroneous and misleading results. Finally, hubs are located using the P-Median method. The P-Median method also incorporates the number of deliveries and population as weights. Real-world delivery data from Muller and Phipps (M&amp;P) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Serving deliveries from the optimal hub locations results in the saving of 815 (10%) meters per delivery.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models in Coding Through Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in code generation. However, generating the correct solution in a single attempt still remains a challenge. Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph. MPSC significantly boosts performance of foundation models (ChatGPT in this paper) on various benchmarks, including HumanEval (+15.91%), MBPP (+6.43%) and CodeContests (+9.37%), even surpassing GPT-4.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Parameter Tractable Algorithm for Counting Markov Equivalence Classes with the same Skeleton</title>

Abstract: Causal DAGs (also known as Bayesian networks) are a popular tool for encoding conditional dependencies between random variables. In a causal DAG, the random variables are modeled as vertices in the DAG, and it is stipulated that every random variable is independent of its ancestors conditioned on its parents. It is possible, however, for two different causal DAGs on the same set of random variables to encode exactly the same set of conditional dependencies. Such causal DAGs are said to be Markov equivalent, and equivalence classes of Markov equivalent DAGs are known as Markov Equivalent Classes (MECs). Beautiful combinatorial characterizations of MECs have been developed in the past few decades, and it is known, in particular that all DAGs in the same MEC must have the same "skeleton" (underlying undirected graph) and v-structures (induced subgraph of the form $a\rightarrow b \leftarrow c$).
  These combinatorial characterizations also suggest several natural algorithmic questions. One of these is: given an undirected graph $G$ as input, how many distinct Markov equivalence classes have the skeleton $G$? Much work has been devoted in the last few years to this and other closely related problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, a polynomial time algorithm for the problem remains unknown.
  In this paper, we make progress towards this goal by giving a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for the above problem, with the parameters being the treewidth and the maximum degree of the input graph $G$. The main technical ingredient in our work is a construction we refer to as shadow, which lets us create a "local description" of long-range constraints imposed by the combinatorial characterizations of MECs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design or: How I learned to start worrying about prompt formatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FormatSpread, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.</description>

      <title>DynaSemble: Dynamic Ensembling of Textual and Structure-Based Models for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two popular approaches to Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC): textual models that rely on textual entity descriptions, and structure-based models that exploit the connectivity structure of the Knowledge Graph (KG). Preliminary experiments show that these approaches have complementary strengths: structure-based models perform exceptionally well when the gold answer is easily reachable from the query head in the KG, while textual models exploit descriptions to give good performance even when the gold answer is not easily reachable. In response, we propose DynaSemble, a novel method for learning query-dependent ensemble weights to combine these approaches by using the distributions of scores assigned by the models in the ensemble to all candidate entities. DynaSemble achieves state-of-the-art results on three standard KGC datasets, with up to 6.8 pt MRR and 8.3 pt Hits@1 gains over the best baseline model for the WN18RR dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text word embeddings that encode distributional semantics work by modeling contextual similarities of frequently occurring words. Acoustic word embeddings, on the other hand, typically encode low-level phonetic similarities. Semantic embeddings for spoken words have been previously explored using analogous algorithms to Word2Vec, but the resulting vectors still mainly encoded phonetic rather than semantic features. In this paper, we examine the assumptions and architectures used in previous works and show experimentally how shallow skipgram-like algorithms fail to encode distributional semantics when the input units are acoustically correlated. We illustrate the potential of an alternative deep end-to-end variant of the model and examine the effects on the resulting embeddings, showing positive results of semantic relatedness in the embedding space.</description>

      <title>Prompt-based Pseudo-labeling Strategy for Sample-Efficient Semi-Supervised Extractive Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a widely used technique in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and unlabeled data is abundant. While SSL is popular for image and text classification, it is relatively underexplored for the task of extractive text summarization. Standard SSL methods follow a teacher-student paradigm to first train a classification model and then use the classifier's confidence values to select pseudo-labels for the subsequent training cycle; however, such classifiers are not suitable to measure the accuracy of pseudo-labels as they lack specific tuning for evaluation, which leads to confidence values that fail to capture the semantics and correctness of the generated summary. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based pseudo-labeling strategy with LLMs that picks unlabeled examples with more accurate pseudo-labels than using just the classifier's probability outputs. Our approach also includes a relabeling mechanism that improves the quality of pseudo-labels. We evaluate our method on three text summarization datasets: TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed. We empirically show that a prompting-based LLM that scores and generates pseudo-labels outperforms existing SSL methods on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores on all the datasets. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive L-Eval scores (evaluation with LLaMa-3) as a fully supervised method in a data-scarce setting and outperforms fully supervised method in a data-abundant setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI foundation models have significant potential for lightening the clinical workload by mimicking the comprehensive and multi-faceted approaches used by medical professionals. In the field of radiation oncology, the integration of multiple modalities holds great importance, so the opportunity of foundational model is abundant. Inspired by this, here we present RO-LMM, a multi-purpose, comprehensive large multimodal model (LMM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model effectively manages a series of tasks within the clinical workflow, including clinical context summarization, radiation treatment plan suggestion, and plan-guided target volume segmentation by leveraging the capabilities of LMM. In particular, to perform consecutive clinical tasks without error accumulation, we present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LMM's robustness to noisy inputs while preserving the consistency of handling clean inputs. We further extend this concept to LMM-driven segmentation framework, leading to a novel Consistency Embedding Segmentation~(CESEG) techniques. Experimental results including multi-centre validation confirm that our RO-LMM with CEFTune and CESEG results in promising performance for multiple clinical tasks with generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fixed-length Dense Descriptor for Efficient Fingerprint Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fingerprint matching, fixed-length descriptors generally offer greater efficiency compared to minutiae set, but the recognition accuracy is not as good as that of the latter. Although much progress has been made in deep learning based fixed-length descriptors recently, they often fall short when dealing with incomplete or partial fingerprints, diverse fingerprint poses, and significant background noise. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional representation called Fixed-length Dense Descriptor (FDD) for efficient fingerprint matching. FDD features great spatial properties, enabling it to capture the spatial relationships of the original fingerprints, thereby enhancing interpretability and robustness. Our experiments on various fingerprint datasets reveal that FDD outperforms other fixed-length descriptors, especially in matching fingerprints of different areas, cross-modal fingerprint matching, and fingerprint matching with background noise.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Reversal Curse and Other Deductive Logical Reasoning in BERT and GPT-Based Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term "Reversal Curse" refers to the scenario where auto-regressive decoder large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, trained on "A is B" fail to learn "B is A," assuming that B and A are distinct and can be uniquely identified from each other, demonstrating a basic failure of logical deduction. This raises a red flag in the use of GPT models for certain general tasks such as constructing knowledge graphs, considering their adherence to this symmetric principle. In our study, we examined a bidirectional LLM, BERT, and found that it is immune to the reversal curse. Driven by ongoing efforts to construct biomedical knowledge graphs with LLMs, we also embarked on evaluating more complex but essential deductive reasoning capabilities. This process included first training encoder and decoder language models to master the intersection and union operations on two sets and then moving on to assess their capability to infer different combinations of union and intersection operations on three newly created sets. The findings showed that while both encoder and decoder language models, trained for tasks involving two sets (union/intersection), were proficient in such scenarios, they encountered difficulties when dealing with operations that included three sets (various combinations of union and intersection). Our research highlights the distinct characteristics of encoder and decoder models in simple and complex logical reasoning. In practice, the choice between BERT and GPT should be guided by the specific requirements and nature of the task at hand, leveraging their respective strengths in bidirectional context comprehension and sequence prediction.</description>

      <title>GSQA: An End-to-End Model for Generative Spoken Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent advancements in spoken question answering (QA), end-to-end models have made significant strides. However, previous research has primarily focused on extractive span selection. While this extractive-based approach is effective when answers are present directly within the input, it falls short in addressing abstractive questions, where answers are not directly extracted but inferred from the given information. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first end-to-end Generative Spoken Question Answering (GSQA) model that empowers the system to engage in abstractive reasoning. The challenge in training our GSQA model lies in the absence of a spoken abstractive QA dataset. We propose using text models for initialization and leveraging the extractive QA dataset to transfer knowledge from the text generative model to the spoken generative model. Experimental results indicate that our model surpasses the previous extractive model by 3% on extractive QA datasets. Furthermore, the GSQA model has only been fine-tuned on the spoken extractive QA dataset. Despite not having seen any spoken abstractive QA data, it can still closely match the performance of the cascade model. In conclusion, our GSQA model shows the potential to generalize to a broad spectrum of questions, thus further expanding the spoken question answering capabilities of abstractive QA. Our code is available at https://voidful.github.io/GSQA</description>

      <title>LHManip: A Dataset for Long-Horizon Language-Grounded Manipulation Tasks in Cluttered Tabletop Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructing a robot to complete an everyday task within our homes has been a long-standing challenge for robotics. While recent progress in language-conditioned imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning has demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, they are typically limited to short-horizon tasks -- not reflective of those a home robot would be expected to complete. While existing architectures have the potential to learn these desired behaviours, the lack of the necessary long-horizon, multi-step datasets for real robotic systems poses a significant challenge. To this end, we present the Long-Horizon Manipulation (LHManip) dataset comprising 200 episodes, demonstrating 20 different manipulation tasks via real robot teleoperation. The tasks entail multiple sub-tasks, including grasping, pushing, stacking and throwing objects in highly cluttered environments. Each task is paired with a natural language instruction and multi-camera viewpoints for point-cloud or NeRF reconstruction. In total, the dataset comprises 176,278 observation-action pairs which form part of the Open X-Embodiment dataset. The full LHManip dataset is made publicly available at https://github.com/fedeceola/LHManip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event sequence models have been found to be highly effective in the analysis and prediction of events. Building such models requires availability of abundant high-quality event sequence data. In certain applications, however, clean structured event sequences are not available, and automated sequence extraction results in data that is too noisy and incomplete. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate event sequences that can effectively be used for probabilistic event model construction. This can be viewed as a mechanism of distilling event sequence knowledge from LLMs. Our approach relies on a Knowledge Graph (KG) of event concepts with partial causal relations to guide the generative language model for causal event sequence generation. We show that our approach can generate high-quality event sequences, filling a knowledge gap in the input KG. Furthermore, we explore how the generated sequences can be leveraged to discover useful and more complex structured knowledge from pattern mining and probabilistic event models. We release our sequence generation code and evaluation framework, as well as corpus of event sequence data.</description>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) house crucial patient data in clinical notes. As these notes grow in volume and complexity, manual extraction becomes challenging. This work introduces a natural language interface using large language models (LLMs) for dynamic question-answering on clinical notes. Our chatbot, powered by Langchain and transformer-based LLMs, allows users to query in natural language, receiving relevant answers from clinical notes. Experiments, utilizing various embedding models and advanced LLMs, show Wizard Vicuna's superior accuracy, albeit with high compute demands. Model optimization, including weight quantization, improves latency by approximately 48 times. Promising results indicate potential, yet challenges such as model hallucinations and limited diverse medical case evaluations remain. Addressing these gaps is crucial for unlocking the value in clinical notes and advancing AI-driven clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>AutoRT: Embodied Foundation Models for Large Scale Orchestration of Robotic Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models that incorporate language, vision, and more recently actions have revolutionized the ability to harness internet scale data to reason about useful tasks. However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such "in-the-wild" data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT's use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and integrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.</description>

      <title>How Reliable Are Automatic Evaluation Methods for Instruction-Tuned LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual transfer. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</description>

      <title>Farsight: Fostering Responsible AI Awareness During AI Application Prototyping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt-based interfaces for Large Language Models (LLMs) have made prototyping and building AI-powered applications easier than ever before. However, identifying potential harms that may arise from AI applications remains a challenge, particularly during prompt-based prototyping. To address this, we present Farsight, a novel in situ interactive tool that helps people identify potential harms from the AI applications they are prototyping. Based on a user's prompt, Farsight highlights news articles about relevant AI incidents and allows users to explore and edit LLM-generated use cases, stakeholders, and harms. We report design insights from a co-design study with 10 AI prototypers and findings from a user study with 42 AI prototypers. After using Farsight, AI prototypers in our user study are better able to independently identify potential harms associated with a prompt and find our tool more useful and usable than existing resources. Their qualitative feedback also highlights that Farsight encourages them to focus on end-users and think beyond immediate harms. We discuss these findings and reflect on their implications for designing AI prototyping experiences that meaningfully engage with AI harms. Farsight is publicly accessible at: https://PAIR-code.github.io/farsight.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Sampling with Optimized Time Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resolution image synthesis, but their sampling efficiency is still to be desired due to the typically large number of sampling steps. Recent advancements in high-order numerical ODE solvers for DPMs have enabled the generation of high-quality images with much fewer sampling steps. While this is a significant development, most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps, which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue, we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method, taking less than $15$ seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that, when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC, our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, compared to using uniform time steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of large language models (LLMs), data augmentation (DA) has emerged as a pivotal technique for enhancing model performance by diversifying training examples without the need for additional data collection. This survey explores the transformative impact of LLMs on DA, particularly addressing the unique challenges and opportunities they present in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. From both data and learning perspectives, we examine various strategies that utilize LLMs for data augmentation, including a novel exploration of learning paradigms where LLM-generated data is used for diverse forms of further training. Additionally, this paper highlights the primary open challenges faced in this domain, ranging from controllable data augmentation to multi-modal data augmentation. This survey highlights a paradigm shift introduced by LLMs in DA, and aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical Knowledge Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports. This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit eSSL's versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL}) framework. Through multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE) approach, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot classification (without training data), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL methods with 10\% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.

      <title>Forward Learning for Gradient-based Black-box Saliency Map Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based saliency maps are widely used to explain deep neural network decisions. However, as models become deeper and more black-box, such as in closed-source APIs like ChatGPT, computing gradients become challenging, hindering conventional explanation methods. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework for estimating gradients in black-box settings and generating saliency maps to interpret model decisions. We employ the likelihood ratio method to estimate output-to-input gradients and utilize them for saliency map generation. Additionally, we propose blockwise computation techniques to enhance estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments in black-box settings validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating accurate gradient estimation and explainability of generated saliency maps. Furthermore, we showcase the scalability of our approach by applying it to explain GPT-Vision, revealing the continued relevance of gradient-based explanation methods in the era of large, closed-source, and black-box models.</description>

      <title>Remote sensing framework for geological mapping via stacked autoencoders and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning methods for geological mapping via remote sensing face limitations due to the scarcity of accurately labelled training data that can be addressed by unsupervised learning, such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. Dimensionality reduction methods have the potential to play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of geological maps. Although conventional dimensionality reduction methods may struggle with nonlinear data, unsupervised deep learning models such as autoencoders can model non-linear relationships. Stacked autoencoders feature multiple interconnected layers to capture hierarchical data representations useful for remote sensing data. This study presents an unsupervised machine learning-based framework for processing remote sensing data using stacked autoencoders for dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering for mapping geological units. We use Landsat 8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2 datasets to evaluate the framework for geological mapping of the Mutawintji region in Western New South Wales, Australia. We also compare stacked autoencoders with principal component analysis and canonical autoencoders. Our results reveal that the framework produces accurate and interpretable geological maps, efficiently discriminating rock units. We find that the accuracy of stacked autoencoders ranges from 86.6 % to 90 %, depending on the remote sensing data type, which is superior to their counterparts. We also find that the generated maps align with prior geological knowledge of the study area while providing novel insights into geological structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer networks are extensively utilized in face forgery detection due to their scalability across large datasets.Despite their success, transformers face challenges in balancing the capture of global context, which is crucial for unveiling forgery clues, with computational complexity.To mitigate this issue, we introduce Band-Attention modulated RetNet (BAR-Net), a lightweight network designed to efficiently process extensive visual contexts while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.Our approach empowers the target token to perceive global information by assigning differential attention levels to tokens at varying distances. We implement self-attention along both spatial axes, thereby maintaining spatial priors and easing the computational burden.Moreover, we present the adaptive frequency Band-Attention Modulation mechanism, which treats the entire Discrete Cosine Transform spectrogram as a series of frequency bands with learnable weights.Together, BAR-Net achieves favorable performance on several face forgery datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Greedy-DiM: Greedy Algorithms for Unreasonably Effective Face Morphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morphing attacks are an emerging threat to state-of-the-art Face Recognition (FR) systems, which aim to create a single image that contains the biometric information of multiple identities. Diffusion Morphs (DiM) are a recently proposed morphing attack that has achieved state-of-the-art performance for representation-based morphing attacks. However, none of the existing research on DiMs have leveraged the iterative nature of DiMs and left the DiM model as a black box, treating it no differently than one would a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Varational AutoEncoder (VAE). We propose a greedy strategy on the iterative sampling process of DiM models which searches for an optimal step guided by an identity-based heuristic function. We compare our proposed algorithm against ten other state-of-the-art morphing algorithms using the open-source SYN-MAD 2022 competition dataset. We find that our proposed algorithm is unreasonably effective, fooling all of the tested FR systems with an MMPMR of 100%, outperforming all other morphing algorithms compared.</description>

      <title>Detecting Edited Knowledge in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing methods (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07719v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence parallelism (SP), which divides the sequence dimension of input tensors across multiple computational devices, is becoming key to unlocking the long-context capabilities of generative AI models. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art SP approaches, i.e. DeepSpeed-Ulysses and Ring-Attention, and proposes a unified SP approach, which is more robust to transformer model architectures and network hardware topology. This paper compares the communication and memory cost of SP and existing parallelism, including data/tensor/zero/pipeline parallelism, and discusses the best practices for designing hybrid 4D parallelism involving SP. We achieved 47% MFU on two 8xA800 nodes using SP for the LLAMA3-8B model training using sequence length 208K.

      <description>arXiv:2405.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have outperformed human experts in predicting the results of neuroscience experiments (Luo et al., 2024). What is the basis for this performance? One possibility is that statistical patterns in that specific scientific literature, as opposed to emergent reasoning abilities arising from broader training, underlie LLMs' performance. To evaluate this possibility, we trained (next word prediction) a relatively small 124M-parameter GPT-2 model on 1.3 billion tokens of domain-specific knowledge. Despite being orders of magnitude smaller than larger LLMs trained on trillions of tokens, small models achieved expert-level performance in predicting neuroscience results. Small models trained on the neuroscience literature succeeded when they were trained from scratch using a tokenizer specifically trained on neuroscience text or when the neuroscience literature was used to finetune a pretrained GPT-2. Our results indicate that expert-level performance may be attained by even small LLMs through domain-specific, auto-regressive training approaches.</description>

      <title>Causal inference approach to appraise long-term effects of maintenance policy on functional performance of asphalt pavements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asphalt pavements as the most prevalent transportation infrastructure, are prone to serious traffic safety problems due to functional or structural damage caused by stresses or strains imposed through repeated traffic loads and continuous climatic cycles. The good quality or high serviceability of infrastructure networks is vital to the urbanization and industrial development of nations. In order to maintain good functional pavement performance and extend the service life of asphalt pavements, the long-term performance of pavements under maintenance policies needs to be evaluated and favorable options selected based on the condition of the pavement. A major challenge in evaluating maintenance policies is to produce valid treatments for the outcome assessment under the control of uncertainty of vehicle loads and the disturbance of freeze-thaw cycles in the climatic environment. In this study, a novel causal inference approach combining a classical causal structural model and a potential outcome model framework is proposed to appraise the long-term effects of four preventive maintenance treatments for longitudinal cracking over a 5-year period of upkeep. Three fundamental issues were brought to our attention: 1) detection of causal relationships prior to variables under environmental loading (identification of causal structure); 2) obtaining direct causal effects of treatment on outcomes excluding covariates (identification of causal effects); and 3) sensitivity analysis of causal relationships. The results show that the method can accurately evaluate the effect of preventive maintenance treatments and assess the maintenance time to cater well for the functional performance of different preventive maintenance approaches. This framework could help policymakers to develop appropriate maintenance strategies for pavements.</description>

      <title>Observational Scaling Laws and the Predictability of Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~80 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</description>

      <title>Action Controlled Paraphrasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential to control paraphrase generation, such as through syntax, which has broad applications in various downstream tasks. However, these methods often require detailed parse trees or syntactic exemplars, countering human-like paraphrasing behavior in language use. Furthermore, an inference gap exists, as control specifications are only available during training but not during inference. In this work, we propose a new setup for controlled paraphrase generation. Specifically, we represent user intent as action tokens, embedding and concatenating them with text embeddings, thus flowing together into a self-attention encoder for representation fusion. To address the inference gap, we introduce an optional action token as a placeholder that encourages the model to determine the appropriate action independently when users' intended actions are not provided. Experimental results show that our method successfully enables precise action-controlled paraphrasing and preserves or even enhances performance compared to conventional uncontrolled methods when actions are not given. Our findings promote the concept of action-controlled paraphrasing for a more user-centered design.</description>

      <title>TEII: Think, Explain, Interact and Iterate with Large Language Models to Solve Cross-lingual Emotion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual emotion detection allows us to analyze global trends, public opinion, and social phenomena at scale. We participated in the Explainability of Cross-lingual Emotion Detection (EXALT) shared task, achieving an F1-score of 0.6046 on the evaluation set for the emotion detection sub-task. Our system outperformed the baseline by more than 0.16 F1-score absolute, and ranked second amongst competing systems. We conducted experiments using fine-tuning, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning for Large Language Model (LLM)-based models as well as embedding-based BiLSTM and KNN for non-LLM-based techniques. Additionally, we introduced two novel methods: the Multi-Iteration Agentic Workflow and the Multi-Binary-Classifier Agentic Workflow. We found that LLM-based approaches provided good performance on multilingual emotion detection. Furthermore, ensembles combining all our experimented models yielded higher F1-scores than any single approach alone.</description>

      <title>Zero Inflation as a Missing Data Problem: a Proxy-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common type of zero-inflated data has certain true values incorrectly replaced by zeros due to data recording conventions (rare outcomes assumed to be absent) or details of data recording equipment (e.g. artificial zeros in gene expression data).
  Existing methods for zero-inflated data either fit the observed data likelihood via parametric mixture models that explicitly represent excess zeros, or aim to replace excess zeros by imputed values. If the goal of the analysis relies on knowing true data realizations, a particular challenge with zero-inflated data is identifiability, since it is difficult to correctly determine which observed zeros are real and which are inflated.
  This paper views zero-inflated data as a general type of missing data problem, where the observability indicator for a potentially censored variable is itself unobserved whenever a zero is recorded. We show that, without additional assumptions, target parameters involving a zero-inflated variable are not identified. However, if a proxy of the missingness indicator is observed, a modification of the effect restoration approach of Kuroki and Pearl allows identification and estimation, given the proxy-indicator relationship is known.
  If this relationship is unknown, our approach yields a partial identification strategy for sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show that only certain proxy-indicator relationships are compatible with the observed data distribution. We give an analytic bound for this relationship in cases with a categorical outcome, which is sharp in certain models. For more complex cases, sharp numerical bounds may be computed using methods in Duarte et al.[2023].
  We illustrate our method via simulation studies and a data application on central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).</description>

      <title>SuperGaussian: Repurposing Video Models for 3D Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, modular, and generic method that upsamples coarse 3D models by adding geometric and appearance details. While generative 3D models now exist, they do not yet match the quality of their counterparts in image and video domains. We demonstrate that it is possible to directly repurpose existing (pretrained) video models for 3D super-resolution and thus sidestep the problem of the shortage of large repositories of high-quality 3D training models. We describe how to repurpose video upsampling models, which are not 3D consistent, and combine them with 3D consolidation to produce 3D-consistent results. As output, we produce high quality Gaussian Splat models, which are object centric and effective. Our method is category agnostic and can be easily incorporated into existing 3D workflows. We evaluate our proposed SuperGaussian on a variety of 3D inputs, which are diverse both in terms of complexity and representation (e.g., Gaussian Splats or NeRFs), and demonstrate that our simple method significantly improves the fidelity of the final 3D models.

      <title>Vision-LSTM: xLSTM as Generic Vision Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are widely used as generic backbones in computer vision, despite initially introduced for natural language processing. Recently, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been extended to a scalable and performant architecture - the xLSTM - which overcomes long-standing LSTM limitations via exponential gating and parallelizable matrix memory structure. In this report, we introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL), an adaption of the xLSTM building blocks to computer vision. ViL comprises a stack of xLSTM blocks where odd blocks process the sequence of patch tokens from top to bottom while even blocks go from bottom to top. Experiments show that ViL holds promise to be further deployed as new generic backbone for computer vision architectures.</description>

      <title>Ents: An Efficient Three-party Training Framework for Decision Trees by Communication Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-party training frameworks for decision trees based on secure multi-party computation enable multiple parties to train high-performance models on distributed private data with privacy preservation. The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion.
  In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by $5.5\times \sim 9.3\times$ in communication sizes and $3.9\times \sim 5.3\times$ in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of $3.5\times \sim 6.7\times$. To demonstrate its practicality, Ents requires less than three hours to securely train a decision tree on a widely used real-world dataset (Skin Segmentation) with more than 245,000 samples in the WAN setting.</description>

      <title>MuirBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Robust Multi-image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MuirBench, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on robust multi-image understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs. MuirBench consists of 12 diverse multi-image tasks (e.g., scene understanding, ordering) that involve 10 categories of multi-image relations (e.g., multiview, temporal relations). Comprising 11,264 images and 2,600 multiple-choice questions, MuirBench is created in a pairwise manner, where each standard instance is paired with an unanswerable variant that has minimal semantic differences, in order for a reliable assessment. Evaluated upon 20 recent multi-modal LLMs, our results reveal that even the best-performing models like GPT-4o and Gemini Pro find it challenging to solve MuirBench, achieving 68.0% and 49.3% in accuracy. Open-source multimodal LLMs trained on single images can hardly generalize to multi-image questions, hovering below 33.3% in accuracy. These results highlight the importance of MuirBench in encouraging the community to develop multimodal LLMs that can look beyond a single image, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Evidential Uncertainty Sets in Deep Classifiers Using Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) method for image classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary AI applications leverage large language models (LLMs) to harness their knowledge and reasoning abilities for natural language processing tasks. This approach shares similarities with the concept of oracle Turing machines (OTMs). To capture the broader potential of these computations, including those not yet realized, we propose an extension to OTMs: the LLM-oracle machine (LLM-OM), by employing a cluster of LLMs as the oracle. Each LLM acts as a black box, capable of answering queries within its expertise, albeit with a delay. We introduce four variants of the LLM-OM: basic, augmented, fault-avoidance, and $\epsilon$-fault. The first two are commonly observed in existing AI applications. The latter two are specifically designed to address the challenges of LLM hallucinations, biases, and inconsistencies, aiming to ensure reliable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges. We leverage TriviaQA as a benchmark for assessing objective knowledge reasoning of LLMs and evaluate them alongside human annotations which we found to have a high inter-annotator agreement. Our study includes 9 judge models and 9 exam taker models -- both base and instruction-tuned. We assess the judge model's alignment across different model sizes, families, and judge prompts. Among other results, our research rediscovers the importance of using Cohen's kappa as a metric of alignment as opposed to simple percent agreement, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores. We find that both Llama-3 70B and GPT-4 Turbo have an excellent alignment with humans, but in terms of ranking exam taker models, they are outperformed by both JudgeLM-7B and the lexical judge Contains, which have up to 34 points lower human alignment. Through error analysis and various other studies, including the effects of instruction length and leniency bias, we hope to provide valuable lessons for using LLMs as judges in the future.</description>

      <title>Adversaries Can Misuse Combinations of Safe Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developers try to evaluate whether an AI system can be misused by adversaries before releasing it; for example, they might test whether a model enables cyberoffense, user manipulation, or bioterrorism. In this work, we show that individually testing models for misuse is inadequate; adversaries can misuse combinations of models even when each individual model is safe. The adversary accomplishes this by first decomposing tasks into subtasks, then solving each subtask with the best-suited model. For example, an adversary might solve challenging-but-benign subtasks with an aligned frontier model, and easy-but-malicious subtasks with a weaker misaligned model. We study two decomposition methods: manual decomposition where a human identifies a natural decomposition of a task, and automated decomposition where a weak model generates benign tasks for a frontier model to solve, then uses the solutions in-context to solve the original task. Using these decompositions, we empirically show that adversaries can create vulnerable code, explicit images, python scripts for hacking, and manipulative tweets at much higher rates with combinations of models than either individual model. Our work suggests that even perfectly-aligned frontier systems can enable misuse without ever producing malicious outputs, and that red-teaming efforts should extend beyond single models in isolation.</description>

      <title>Deep Imbalanced Regression to Estimate Vascular Age from PPG Data: a Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is emerging as a crucial tool for monitoring human hemodynamics, with recent studies highlighting its potential in assessing vascular aging through deep learning. However, real-world age distributions are often imbalanced, posing significant challenges for deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, simple, and effective loss function named the Dist Loss to address deep imbalanced regression tasks. We trained a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Net1D) incorporating the Dist Loss on the extensive UK Biobank dataset (n=502,389) to estimate vascular age from PPG signals and validate its efficacy in characterizing cardiovascular health. The model's performance was validated on a 40% held-out test set, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially in regions with small sample sizes. Furthermore, we divided the population into three subgroups based on the difference between predicted vascular age and chronological age: less than -10 years, between -10 and 10 years, and greater than 10 years. We analyzed the relationship between predicted vascular age and several cardiovascular events over a follow-up period of up to 10 years, including death, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. Our results indicate that the predicted vascular age has significant potential to reflect an individual's cardiovascular health status. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ngk03/AI-vascular-age.</description>

      <title>Automated radiotherapy treatment planning guided by GPT-4Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a time-consuming and potentially subjective process that requires the iterative adjustment of model parameters to balance multiple conflicting objectives. Recent advancements in large foundation models offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges in planning and clinical decision-making. This study introduces GPT-RadPlan, a fully automated treatment planning framework that harnesses prior radiation oncology knowledge encoded in multi-modal large language models, such as GPT-4Vision (GPT-4V) from OpenAI. GPT-RadPlan is made aware of planning protocols as context and acts as an expert human planner, capable of guiding a treatment planning process. Via in-context learning, we incorporate clinical protocols for various disease sites as prompts to enable GPT-4V to acquire treatment planning domain knowledge. The resulting GPT-RadPlan agent is integrated into our in-house inverse treatment planning system through an API. The efficacy of the automated planning system is showcased using multiple prostate and head &amp; neck cancer cases, where we compared GPT-RadPlan results to clinical plans. In all cases, GPT-RadPlan either outperformed or matched the clinical plans, demonstrating superior target coverage and organ-at-risk sparing. Consistently satisfying the dosimetric objectives in the clinical protocol, GPT-RadPlan represents the first multimodal large language model agent that mimics the behaviors of human planners in radiation oncology clinics, achieving remarkable results in automating the treatment planning process without the need for additional training.</description>

      <title>Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

      <title>On the consistency of hyper-parameter selection in value-based deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved tremendous success on various domains through a combination of algorithmic design and careful selection of hyper-parameters. Algorithmic improvements are often the result of iterative enhancements built upon prior approaches, while hyper-parameter choices are typically inherited from previous methods or fine-tuned specifically for the proposed technique. Despite their crucial impact on performance, hyper-parameter choices are frequently overshadowed by algorithmic advancements. This paper conducts an extensive empirical study focusing on the reliability of hyper-parameter selection for value-based deep reinforcement learning agents, including the introduction of a new score to quantify the consistency and reliability of various hyper-parameters. Our findings not only help establish which hyper-parameters are most critical to tune, but also help clarify which tunings remain consistent across different training regimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for intuitive robot programming by non-experts, leveraging natural language prompts and contextual information from the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our system integrates large language models (LLMs), enabling non-experts to articulate task requirements to the system through a chat interface. Key features of the framework include: integration of ROS with an AI agent connected to a plethora of open-source and commercial LLMs, automatic extraction of a behavior from the LLM output and execution of ROS actions/services, support for three behavior modes (sequence, behavior tree, state machine), imitation learning for adding new robot actions to the library of possible actions, and LLM reflection via human and environment feedback. Extensive experiments validate the framework, showcasing robustness, scalability, and versatility in diverse scenarios, including long-horizon tasks, tabletop rearrangements, and remote supervisory control. To facilitate the adoption of our framework and support the reproduction of our results, we have made our code open-source.

      <title>BMW Agents -- A Framework For Task Automation Through Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous agents working together towards solving tasks.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Alternative to Neural Representation Learning for Rating Prediction -- Transparent Latent Class Modeling of User Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural network (NN) and deep learning (DL) techniques are widely adopted in many applications, including recommender systems. Given the sparse and stochastic nature of collaborative filtering (CF) data, recent works have critically analyzed the effective improvement of neural-based approaches compared to simpler and often transparent algorithms for recommendation. Previous results showed that NN and DL models can be outperformed by traditional algorithms in many tasks. Moreover, given the largely black-box nature of neural-based methods, interpretable results are not naturally obtained. Following on this debate, we first present a transparent probabilistic model that topologically organizes user and product latent classes based on the review information. In contrast to popular neural techniques for representation learning, we readily obtain a statistical, visualization-friendly tool that can be easily inspected to understand user and product characteristics from a textual-based perspective. Then, given the limitations of common embedding techniques, we investigate the possibility of using the estimated interpretable quantities as model input for a rating prediction task. To contribute to the recent debates, we evaluate our results in terms of both capacity for interpretability and predictive performances in comparison with popular text-based neural approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed latent class representations can yield competitive predictive performances, compared to popular, but difficult-to-interpret approaches.</description>

      <title>Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Synthetic Data Across Multiple Medical Modalities: A Systematic Review of Recent Developments and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of generative models (GANs, VAEs, DMs, and LLMs) used to synthesize various medical data types, including imaging (dermoscopic, mammographic, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray), text, time-series, and tabular data (EHR). Unlike previous narrowly focused reviews, our study encompasses a broad array of medical data modalities and explores various generative models. Our search strategy queries databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ArXiv, focusing on recent works from January 2021 to November 2023, excluding reviews and perspectives. This period emphasizes recent advancements beyond GANs, which have been extensively covered previously.
  The survey reveals insights from three key aspects: (1) Synthesis applications and purpose of synthesis, (2) generation techniques, and (3) evaluation methods. It highlights clinically valid synthesis applications, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data to tackle diverse clinical requirements. While conditional models incorporating class labels, segmentation masks and image translations are prevalent, there is a gap in utilizing prior clinical knowledge and patient-specific context, suggesting a need for more personalized synthesis approaches and emphasizing the importance of tailoring generative approaches to the unique characteristics of medical data. Additionally, there is a significant gap in using synthetic data beyond augmentation, such as for validation and evaluation of downstream medical AI models. The survey uncovers that the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies tailored to medical images is a barrier to clinical application, underscoring the need for in-depth evaluation approaches, benchmarking, and comparative studies to promote openness and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>Divide And Conquer: Learning Chaotic Dynamical Systems With Multistep Penalty Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in various fields, such as the geosciences and engineering. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), which combine the power of neural networks and numerical solvers, have emerged as a promising algorithm for forecasting complex nonlinear dynamical systems. However, classical techniques used for NODE training are ineffective for learning chaotic dynamical systems. In this work, we propose a novel NODE-training approach that allows for robust learning of chaotic dynamical systems. Our method addresses the challenges of non-convexity and exploding gradients associated with underlying chaotic dynamics. Training data trajectories from such systems are split into multiple, non-overlapping time windows. In addition to the deviation from the training data, the optimization loss term further penalizes the discontinuities of the predicted trajectory between the time windows. The window size is selected based on the fastest Lyapunov time scale of the system. Multi-step penalty(MP) method is first demonstrated on Lorenz equation, to illustrate how it improves the loss landscape and thereby accelerating the optimization convergence. MP method can optimize chaotic systems in a manner similar to least-squares shadowing with significantly lower computational costs. Our proposed algorithm, denoted the Multistep Penalty NODE(MP-NODE), is applied to chaotic systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow. It is observed that MP-NODE provide viable performance for such chaotic systems, not only for short-term trajectory predictions but also for invariant statistics that are hallmarks of the chaotic nature of these dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has helped extend speech technologies to more languages by reducing the need for labeled data. However, models are still far from supporting the world's 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT 2.0 v2 by 0.8% and 4.4% respectively, despite having less parameters or pre-training data. Checkpoints, code, and data are found in https://www.wavlab.org/activities/2024/xeus/.</description>

      <title>Embedded Prompt Tuning: Towards Enhanced Calibration of Pretrained Models for Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

      <title>Contractual Reinforcement Learning: Pulling Arms with Invisible Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The agency problem emerges in today's large scale machine learning tasks, where the learners are unable to direct content creation or enforce data collection. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for aligning economic interests of different stakeholders in the online learning problems through contract design. The problem, termed \emph{contractual reinforcement learning}, naturally arises from the classic model of Markov decision processes, where a learning principal seeks to optimally influence the agent's action policy for their common interests through a set of payment rules contingent on the realization of next state. For the planning problem, we design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal contracts against the far-sighted agent. For the learning problem, we introduce a generic design of no-regret learning algorithms to untangle the challenges from robust design of contracts to the balance of exploration and exploitation, reducing the complexity analysis to the construction of efficient search algorithms. For several natural classes of problems, we design tailored search algorithms that provably achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We also present an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for the general problem that improves the existing analysis in online contract design with mild technical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Empowering 3D Visual Grounding with Reasoning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although great progress has been made in 3D visual grounding, current models still rely on explicit textual descriptions for grounding and lack the ability to reason human intentions from implicit instructions. We propose a new task called 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which provides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that require the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our approach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered by Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to obtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and fine-grained details from the 3D scenes. A chain-of-grounding mechanism is proposed to further boost the performance with interleaved reasoning and grounding steps during inference. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>
