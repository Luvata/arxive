      <title>FinBERT-QA: Financial Question Answering with pre-trained BERT Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging demand in the financial industry for the automatic analysis of unstructured and structured data at scale, Question Answering (QA) systems can provide lucrative and competitive advantages to companies by facilitating the decision making of financial advisers. Consequently, we propose a novel financial QA system using the transformer-based pre-trained BERT language model to address the limitations of data scarcity and language specificity in the financial domain. Our system focuses on financial non-factoid answer selection, which retrieves a set of passage-level texts and selects the most relevant as the answer. To increase efficiency, we formulate the answer selection task as a re-ranking problem, in which our system consists of an Answer Retriever using BM25, a simple information retrieval approach, to first return a list of candidate answers, and an Answer Re-ranker built with variants of pre-trained BERT language models to re-rank and select the most relevant answers. We investigate various learning, further pre-training, and fine-tuning approaches for BERT. Our experiments suggest that FinBERT-QA, a model built from applying the Transfer and Adapt further fine-tuning and pointwise learning approach, is the most effective, improving the state-of-the-art results of task 2 of the FiQA dataset by 16% on MRR, 17% on NDCG, and 21% on Precision@1.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Model based Human-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment &amp; profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

      <title>Reasoning Capabilities and Invariability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in manipulating natural language across multiple applications, but their ability to handle simple reasoning tasks is often questioned. In this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of LLMs' reasoning competence, specifically focusing on their prompt dependency. In particular, we introduce a new benchmark dataset with a series of simple reasoning questions demanding shallow logical reasoning. Aligned with cognitive psychology standards, the questions are confined to a basic domain revolving around geometric figures, ensuring that responses are independent of any pre-existing intuition about the world and rely solely on deduction. An empirical analysis involving zero-shot and few-shot prompting across 24 LLMs of different sizes reveals that, while LLMs with over 70 billion parameters perform better in the zero-shot setting, there is still a large room for improvement. An additional test with chain-of-thought prompting over 22 LLMs shows that this additional prompt can aid or damage the performance of models, depending on whether the rationale is required before or after the answer.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-augmented Pre-trained Language Models for Biomedical Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic relationship extraction (RE) from biomedical literature is critical for managing the vast amount of scientific knowledge produced each year. In recent years, utilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become the prevalent approach in RE. Several studies report improved performance when incorporating additional context information while fine-tuning PLMs for RE. However, variations in the PLMs applied, the databases used for augmentation, hyper-parameter optimization, and evaluation methods complicate direct comparisons between studies and raise questions about the generalizability of these findings. Our study addresses this research gap by evaluating PLMs enhanced with contextual information on five datasets spanning four relation scenarios within a consistent evaluation framework. We evaluate three baseline PLMs and first conduct extensive hyperparameter optimization. After selecting the top-performing model, we enhance it with additional data, including textual entity descriptions, relational information from knowledge graphs, and molecular structure encodings. Our findings illustrate the importance of i) the choice of the underlying language model and ii) a comprehensive hyperparameter optimization for achieving strong extraction performance. Although inclusion of context information yield only minor overall improvements, an ablation study reveals substantial benefits for smaller PLMs when such external data was included during fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Assessment of Grammatical Accuracy in English Language Learner Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to scale-up Dynamic Assessment (DA). To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.</description>

      <title>Llama-Nemotron: Efficient Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</description>

      <title>A Character-based Diffusion Embedding Algorithm for Enhancing the Generation Quality of Generative Linguistic Steganographic Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality steganographic text is a fundamental challenge in the field of generative linguistic steganography. This challenge arises primarily from two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text generation are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively mitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as semantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can accurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to consider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This phenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate words and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising the semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and diminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm, character-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding algorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's properties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's properties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate words in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the character level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while reducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the candidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of sensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet significantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text, particularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility.</description>

      <title>Synthesize-on-Graph: Knowledgeable Synthetic Data Generation for Continue Pre-training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&amp;A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.</description>

      <title>Position: Enough of Scaling LLMs! Lets Focus on Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge the dominant focus on neural scaling laws and advocate for a paradigm shift toward downscaling in the development of large language models (LLMs). While scaling laws have provided critical insights into performance improvements through increasing model and dataset size, we emphasize the significant limitations of this approach, particularly in terms of computational inefficiency, environmental impact, and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic framework for downscaling LLMs that seeks to maintain performance while drastically reducing resource demands. This paper outlines practical strategies for transitioning away from traditional scaling paradigms, advocating for a more sustainable, efficient, and accessible approach to LLM development.</description>

      <title>VTS-LLM: Domain-Adaptive LLM Agent for Enhancing Awareness in Vessel Traffic Services through Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) are essential for maritime safety and regulatory compliance through real-time traffic management. However, with increasing traffic complexity and the prevalence of heterogeneous, multimodal data, existing VTS systems face limitations in spatiotemporal reasoning and intuitive human interaction. In this work, we propose VTS-LLM Agent, the first domain-adaptive large LLM agent tailored for interactive decision support in VTS operations. We formalize risk-prone vessel identification as a knowledge-augmented Text-to-SQL task, combining structured vessel databases with external maritime knowledge. To support this, we construct a curated benchmark dataset consisting of a custom schema, domain-specific corpus, and a query-SQL test set in multiple linguistic styles. Our framework incorporates NER-based relational reasoning, agent-based domain knowledge injection, semantic algebra intermediate representation, and query rethink mechanisms to enhance domain grounding and context-aware understanding. Experimental results show that VTS-LLM outperforms both general-purpose and SQL-focused baselines under command-style, operational-style, and formal natural language queries, respectively. Moreover, our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that linguistic style variation introduces systematic performance challenges in Text-to-SQL modeling. This work lays the foundation for natural language interfaces in vessel traffic services and opens new opportunities for proactive, LLM-driven maritime real-time traffic management.</description>

      <title>Token-free Models for Sarcasm Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization is a foundational step in most natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, yet it introduces challenges such as vocabulary mismatch and out-of-vocabulary issues. Recent work has shown that models operating directly on raw text at the byte or character level can mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we evaluate two token-free models, ByT5 and CANINE, on the task of sarcasm detection in both social media (Twitter) and non-social media (news headlines) domains. We fine-tune and benchmark these models against token-based baselines and state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that ByT5-small and CANINE outperform token-based counterparts and achieve new state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by 0.77% and 0.49% on the News Headlines and Twitter Sarcasm datasets, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of token-free models for robust NLP in noisy and informal domains such as social media.</description>

      <title>Value Portrait: Understanding Values of LLMs with Human-aligned Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.</description>

      <title>Do We Need a Detailed Rubric for Automated Essay Scoring using Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the necessity and impact of a detailed rubric in automated essay scoring (AES) using large language models (LLMs). While using rubrics are standard in LLM-based AES, creating detailed rubrics requires substantial ef-fort and increases token usage. We examined how different levels of rubric detail affect scoring accuracy across multiple LLMs using the TOEFL11 dataset. Our experiments compared three conditions: a full rubric, a simplified rubric, and no rubric, using four different LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 3 70B Instruct). Results showed that three out of four models maintained similar scoring accuracy with the simplified rubric compared to the detailed one, while significantly reducing token usage. However, one model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) showed decreased performance with more detailed rubrics. The findings suggest that simplified rubrics may be sufficient for most LLM-based AES applications, offering a more efficient alternative without compromis-ing scoring accuracy. However, model-specific evaluation remains crucial as per-formance patterns vary across different LLMs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Transformers are Hierarchical Modal-wise Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a rapidly developing field that integrates multimodal information to recognize sentiments, and existing models have made significant progress in this area. The central challenge in MSA is multimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers (MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns. In this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and prove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and we introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on this pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is formally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing mechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One fusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs. A Triton kernel called Decomposition is implemented to ensure avoiding additional computational overhead. Moreover, it achieves significantly higher performance than traditional MulTs. To further validate the effectiveness of GsiT itself and the HMHG concept, we integrate them into multiple state-of-the-art models and demonstrate notable performance improvements and parameter reduction on widely used MSA datasets.</description>

      <title>MateICL: Mitigating Attention Dispersion in Large-Scale In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the fixed position length constraints in pre-trained models limit the number of demonstration examples. Recent efforts to extend context suffer from attention dispersion as the number of demonstrations increases. In this paper, we introduce Mitigating Attention Dispersion in large-scale ICL (MateICL) that enables LLMs to maintain effective self-attention as the context size grows. We first split the context into multiple windows, each filled to the model's context capacity, which are processed separately. Then, we introduce an additional layer to recalibrate the attention weights, prioritizing the query tokens as the number of demonstrations increases. Our empirical results show that MateICL can effectively leverage larger contexts to improve ICL performance. Compared to retrieval-based baselines, MateICL consistently achieves better performance without requiring an externally trained retrieval model. Despite recent advances in inference strategies (e.g., 32k token contexts), our results demonstrate that MateICL remains beneficial in computationally resource-constrained settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/amurtadha/MateICL.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Steering in Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering vectors are a promising approach to aligning language model behavior at inference time. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias in Explainability: Investigating Performance Disparity in Post-hoc Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While research on applications and evaluations of explanation methods continues to expand, fairness of the explanation methods concerning disparities in their performance across subgroups remains an often overlooked aspect. In this paper, we address this gap by showing that, across three tasks and five language models, widely used post-hoc feature attribution methods exhibit significant gender disparity with respect to their faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. These disparities persist even when the models are pre-trained or fine-tuned on particularly unbiased datasets, indicating that the disparities we observe are not merely consequences of biased training data. Our results highlight the importance of addressing disparities in explanations when developing and applying explainability methods, as these can lead to biased outcomes against certain subgroups, with particularly critical implications in high-stakes contexts. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating the fairness of explanations, alongside overall model fairness and explainability, as a requirement in regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>EvalxNLP: A Framework for Benchmarking Post-Hoc Explainability Methods on NLP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.</description>

      <title>PREMISE: Matching-based Prediction for Accurate Review Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PREMISE (PREdict with Matching ScorEs), a new architecture for the matching-based learning in the multimodal fields for the multimodal review helpfulness (MRHP) task. Distinct to previous fusion-based methods which obtains multimodal representations via cross-modal attention for downstream tasks, PREMISE computes the multi-scale and multi-field representations, filters duplicated semantics, and then obtained a set of matching scores as feature vectors for the downstream recommendation task. This new architecture significantly boosts the performance for such multimodal tasks whose context matching content are highly correlated to the targets of that task, compared to the state-of-the-art fusion-based methods. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that PREMISE achieves promising performance with less computational cost.</description>

      <title>Anti-adversarial Learning: Desensitizing Prompts for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of LLMs, preserving privacy in user prompts has become crucial, as prompts risk exposing privacy and sensitive data to the cloud LLMs. Traditional techniques like homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and federated learning face challenges due to heavy computational costs and user participation requirements, limiting their applicability in LLM scenarios. In this paper, we propose PromptObfus, a novel method for desensitizing LLM prompts. The core idea of PromptObfus is "anti-adversarial" learning, which perturbs privacy words in the prompt to obscure sensitive information while retaining the stability of model predictions. Specifically, PromptObfus frames prompt desensitization as a masked language modeling task, replacing privacy-sensitive terms with a [MASK] token. A desensitization model is trained to generate candidate replacements for each masked position. These candidates are subsequently selected based on gradient feedback from a surrogate model, ensuring minimal disruption to the task output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three NLP tasks. Results show that PromptObfus effectively prevents privacy inference from remote LLMs while preserving task performance.</description>

      <title>A Factorized Probabilistic Model of the Semantics of Vague Temporal Adverbials Relative to Different Event Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vague temporal adverbials, such as recently, just, and a long time ago, describe the temporal distance between a past event and the utterance time but leave the exact duration underspecified. In this paper, we introduce a factorized model that captures the semantics of these adverbials as probabilistic distributions. These distributions are composed with event-specific distributions to yield a contextualized meaning for an adverbial applied to a specific event. We fit the model's parameters using existing data capturing judgments of native speakers regarding the applicability of these vague temporal adverbials to events that took place a given time ago. Comparing our approach to a non-factorized model based on a single Gaussian distribution for each pair of event and temporal adverbial, we find that while both models have similar predictive power, our model is preferable in terms of Occam's razor, as it is simpler and has better extendability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for neural network structures with better translation results, we considered perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation metric.</description>

      <title>Helping Big Language Models Protect Themselves: An Enhanced Filtering and Summarization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and encoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate retraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for deployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents a unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend against adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts to the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot classification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64, hexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and (2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research literature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach strengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text extraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to experimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in identifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded prompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as context, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful inputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate. While maintaining the quality of LLM responses, the framework dramatically increases LLM's resistance to hostile misuse, demonstrating its efficacy as a quick and easy substitute for time-consuming, retraining-based defenses.</description>

      <title>TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague, Implicit and Explicit References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models.
  The benchmark is publicly available at: https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/s.kenneweg/TRAVELER</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Language Models as Text-to-Image Model Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steady improvements of text-to-image (T2I) generative models lead to slow deprecation of automatic evaluation benchmarks that rely on static datasets, motivating researchers to seek alternative ways to evaluate the T2I progress. In this paper, we explore the potential of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as evaluator agents that interact with a T2I model, with the objective of assessing prompt-generation consistency and image aesthetics. We present Multimodal Text-to-Image Eval (MT2IE), an evaluation framework that iteratively generates prompts for evaluation, scores generated images and matches T2I evaluation of existing benchmarks with a fraction of the prompts used in existing static benchmarks. Moreover, we show that MT2IE's prompt-generation consistency scores have higher correlation with human judgment than scores previously introduced in the literature. MT2IE generates prompts that are efficient at probing T2I model performance, producing the same relative T2I model rankings as existing benchmarks while using only 1/80th the number of prompts for evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Philosophy of Explanations in Mechanistic Interpretability -- The Strange Science Part I.i</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.</description>

      <title>SmallPlan: Leverage Small Language Models for Sequential Path Planning with Simulation-Powered, LLM-Guided Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.</description>

      <title>NeMo-Inspector: A Visualization Tool for LLM Generation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to novel tasks and enhancing their overall capabilities often requires large, high-quality training datasets. Synthetic data, generated at scale, serves a valuable alternative when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain. However, ensuring the quality of synthetic datasets is challenging, as developers must manually inspect and refine numerous samples to identify errors and areas for improvement. This process is time-consuming and requires specialized tools. We introduce NeMo-Inspector, an open-source tool designed to simplify the analysis of synthetic datasets with integrated inference capabilities. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two real-world cases. Analysis and cleaning of the synthetically generated GSM-Plus dataset with NeMo-Inspector led to a significant decrease in low-quality samples from 46.99% to 19.51%. The tool also helped identify and correct generation errors in OpenMath models, improving accuracy by 1.92% on the MATH dataset and by 4.17% on the GSM8K dataset for a Meta-Llama-3-8B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated from Nemotron-4-340B.</description>

Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Attack and defense techniques in large language models: A survey and new perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards the Resistance of Neural Network Watermarking to Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proves a new watermarking method to embed the ownership information into a deep neural network (DNN), which is robust to fine-tuning. Specifically, we prove that when the input feature of a convolutional layer only contains low-frequency components, specific frequency components of the convolutional filter will not be changed by gradient descent during the fine-tuning process, where we propose a revised Fourier transform to extract frequency components from the convolutional filter. Additionally, we also prove that these frequency components are equivariant to weight scaling and weight permutations. In this way, we design a watermark module to encode the watermark information to specific frequency components in a convolutional filter. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Vision Language Model Adaptations for Radiology Report Generation in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has opened new horizons for improving medical diagnostics and patient care. However, challenges persist in developing systems capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant radiology reports, particularly in low-resource languages. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of instruction-tuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the specialized task of radiology report generation across three low-resource languages: Italian, German, and Spanish. Employing the LLaVA architectural framework, we conducted a systematic evaluation of pre-trained models utilizing general datasets, domain-specific datasets, and low-resource language-specific datasets. In light of the unavailability of models that possess prior knowledge of both the medical domain and low-resource languages, we analyzed various adaptations to determine the most effective approach for these contexts. The results revealed that language-specific models substantially outperformed both general and domain-specific models in generating radiology reports, emphasizing the critical role of linguistic adaptation. Additionally, models fine-tuned with medical terminology exhibited enhanced performance across all languages compared to models with generic knowledge, highlighting the importance of domain-specific training. We also explored the influence of the temperature parameter on the coherence of report generation, providing insights for optimal model settings. Our findings highlight the importance of tailored language and domain-specific training for improving the quality and accuracy of radiological reports in multilingual settings. This research not only advances our understanding of VLMs adaptability in healthcare but also points to significant avenues for future investigations into model tuning and language-specific adaptations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Explanations: An Explanatory Virtues Framework for Mechanistic Interpretability -- The Strange Science Part I.ii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. Though MI has many explanation-generating methods, progress has been limited by the lack of a universal approach to evaluating explanations. Here we analyse the fundamental question "What makes a good explanation?" We introduce a pluralist Explanatory Virtues Framework drawing on four perspectives from the Philosophy of Science - the Bayesian, Kuhnian, Deutschian, and Nomological - to systematically evaluate and improve explanations in MI. We find that Compact Proofs consider many explanatory virtues and are hence a promising approach. Fruitful research directions implied by our framework include (1) clearly defining explanatory simplicity, (2) focusing on unifying explanations and (3) deriving universal principles for neural networks. Improved MI methods enhance our ability to monitor, predict, and steer AI systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects. This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations. Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries. In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains. This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Do Vision &amp; Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.</description>

      <title>REFFLY: Melody-Constrained Lyrics Editing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic melody-to-lyric (M2L) generation aims to create lyrics that align with a given melody. While most previous approaches generate lyrics from scratch, revision, editing plain text draft to fit it into the melody, offers a much more flexible and practical alternative. This enables broad applications, such as generating lyrics from flexible inputs (keywords, themes, or full text that needs refining to be singable), song translation (preserving meaning across languages while keeping the melody intact), or style transfer (adapting lyrics to different genres). This paper introduces REFFLY (REvision Framework For LYrics), the first revision framework for editing and generating melody-aligned lyrics. We train the lyric revision module using our curated synthesized melody-aligned lyrics dataset, enabling it to transform plain text into lyrics that align with a given melody. To further enhance the revision ability, we propose training-free heuristics aimed at preserving both semantic meaning and musical consistency throughout the editing process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of REFFLY across various tasks (e.g. lyrics generation, song translation), showing that our model outperforms strong baselines, including Lyra (Tian et al., 2023) and GPT-4, by 25% in both musicality and text quality.</description>

      <title>Does Self-Attention Need Separate Weights in Transformers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of self-attention lies in its ability to capture long-range dependencies and enhance context understanding, but it is limited by its computational complexity and challenges in handling sequential data with inherent directionality. This work introduces a shared weight self-attention-based BERT model that only learns one weight matrix for (Key, Value, and Query) representations instead of three individual matrices for each of them. Our shared weight attention reduces the training parameter size by more than half and training time by around one-tenth. Furthermore, we demonstrate higher prediction accuracy on small tasks of GLUE over the BERT baseline and in particular a generalization power on noisy and out-of-domain data. Experimental results indicate that our shared self-attention method achieves a parameter size reduction of 66.53% in the attention block. In the GLUE dataset, the shared weight self-attention-based BERT model demonstrates accuracy improvements of 0.38%, 5.81%, and 1.06% over the standard, symmetric, and pairwise attention-based BERT models, respectively. The model and source code are available at Anonymous.</description>

      <title>When Every Token Counts: Optimal Segmentation for Low-Resource Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</description>

      <title>AutoPrep: Natural Language Question-Aware Data Preparation with a Multi-Agent Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation...</description>

      <title>ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.</description>

      <title>TableMaster: A Recipe to Advance Table Understanding with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tables serve as a fundamental format for representing structured relational data. While current language models (LMs) excel at many text-based tasks, they still face challenges in table understanding due to the complex characteristics of tabular data, such as their structured nature. In this paper, we aim to enhance LMs for improved table understanding. We identify four key challenges: 1) difficulty in locating target data, 2) deficiency in table semantics, 3) numerical inaccuracies in textual reasoning, and 4) semantic inflexibility in symbolic reasoning. To address these issues, we propose TableMaster, a recipe and comprehensive framework that integrates multiple solutions to overcome these obstacles. TableMaster first extracts relevant table content and verbalizes it with enriched semantic context. Additionally, we introduce adaptive reasoning, a flexible approach that dynamically adjusts between textual and symbolic reasoning, tailoring the reasoning process to each query. Extensive analyses and experiments demonstrate our findings and the effectiveness of TableMaster. On the WikiTQ dataset, TableMaster achieves an accuracy of 78.13% using GPT-4o-mini, surpassing existing baselines.</description>

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \&amp; LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.</description>

      <title>Accuracy is Not Agreement: Expert-Aligned Evaluation of Crash Narrative Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between deep learning (DL) model accuracy and expert agreement in classifying crash narratives. We evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, USE, and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert labels and narratives, and extend the analysis to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our findings reveal an inverse relationship: models with higher technical accuracy often show lower agreement with human experts, while LLMs demonstrate stronger expert alignment despite lower accuracy. We use Cohen's Kappa and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify and visualize model-expert agreement, and employ SHAP analysis to explain misclassifications. Results show that expert-aligned models rely more on contextual and temporal cues than location-specific keywords. These findings suggest that accuracy alone is insufficient for safety-critical NLP tasks. We argue for incorporating expert agreement into model evaluation frameworks and highlight the potential of LLMs as interpretable tools in crash analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a relative 33.9\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a relative 14.5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.</description>

      <title>Clustering Internet Memes Through Template Matching and Multi-Dimensional Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content, text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent research.</description>

      <title>100 Days After DeepSeek-R1: A Survey on Replication Studies and More Directions for Reasoning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.</description>

      <title>Automating the Generation of Prompts for LLM-based Action Choice in PDDL Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09830v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL. Our NL prompts yield better performance than PDDL prompts and simple template-based NL prompts. Compared to symbolic planners, LLM planning lags far behind; but in some domains, our best LLM configuration scales up further than A$^\star$ using LM-cut.</description>

      <title>FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and Parameter-Efficient Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet serving stacks today isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in solving table interpretation tasks has grown over the years, yet it still relies on existing datasets that may be overly simplified. This is potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dataset for thorough evaluation and failing to accurately represent tables as they appear in the real-world. To enrich the existing benchmark datasets, we extract and annotate a new, more challenging dataset. The proposed Wiki-TabNER dataset features complex tables containing several entities per cell, with named entities labeled using DBpedia classes. This dataset is specifically designed to address named entity recognition (NER) task within tables, but it can also be used as a more challenging dataset for evaluating the entity linking task. In this paper we describe the distinguishing features of the Wiki-TabNER dataset and the labeling process. In addition, we propose a prompting framework for evaluating the new large language models on the within tables NER task. Finally, we perform qualitative analysis to gain insights into the challenges encountered by the models and to understand the limitations of the proposed~dataset.</description>

      <title>MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</description>

      <title>Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction: Exploring GPT in a Controlled Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for text summarization. We define the summarizer rate-distortion function and show that it provides a fundamental lower bound on summarizer performance. We describe an iterative procedure, similar to Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, for computing this function. To handle real-world text datasets, we also propose a practical method that can calculate the summarizer rate-distortion function with limited data. Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>A False Sense of Privacy: Evaluating Textual Data Sanitization Beyond Surface-level Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.</description>

      <title>Self-Generated In-Context Examples Improve LLM Agents for Sequential Decision-Making Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.</description>
