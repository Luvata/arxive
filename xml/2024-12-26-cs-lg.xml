      <title>LaMI-GO: Latent Mixture Integration for Goal-Oriented Communications Achieving High Spectrum Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rise of semantic-style communications includes the development of goal-oriented communications (GOCOMs) remarkably efficient multimedia information transmissions. The concept of GO-COMS leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to address the rising demand for bandwidth efficiency in applications, such as edge computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Unlike traditional communication systems focusing on source data accuracy, GO-COMs provide intelligent message delivery catering to the special needs critical to accomplishing downstream tasks at the receiver. In this work, we present a novel GO-COM framework, namely LaMI-GO that utilizes emerging generative AI for better quality-of-service (QoS) with ultra-high communication efficiency. Specifically, we design our LaMI-GO system backbone based on a latent diffusion model followed by a vector-quantized generative adversarial network (VQGAN) for efficient latent embedding and information representation. The system trains a common feature codebook the receiver side. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvement in perceptual quality, accuracy of downstream tasks, and bandwidth consumption over the state-of-the-art GOCOM systems and establish the power of our proposed LaMI-GO communication framework.</description>

      <title>Zero Shot Time Series Forecasting Using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate energy price forecasting is crucial for participants in day-ahead energy markets, as it significantly influences their decision-making processes. While machine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these forecasts, they often remain confined to the specific markets on which they are trained, thereby limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. In this paper, we introduce a cross-domain adaptation model designed to forecast energy prices by learning market-invariant representations across different markets during the training phase. We propose a doubly residual N-BEATS network with Kolmogorov Arnold networks at its core for time series forecasting. These networks, grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a powerful way to approximate multivariate continuous functions. The cross domain adaptation model was generated with an adversarial framework. The model's effectiveness was tested in predicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero shot fashion. In comparison with baseline models, our proposed framework shows promising results. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can potentially enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in energy price data, thus improving forecast accuracy across diverse market conditions. This addition not only enriches the model's representational capacity but also contributes to a more robust and flexible forecasting tool adaptable to various energy markets.</description>

      <title>Active Geospatial Search for Efficient Tenant Eviction Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tenant evictions threaten housing stability and are a major concern for many cities. An open question concerns whether data-driven methods enhance outreach programs that target at-risk tenants to mitigate their risk of eviction. We propose a novel active geospatial search (AGS) modeling framework for this problem. AGS integrates property-level information in a search policy that identifies a sequence of rental units to canvas to both determine their eviction risk and provide support if needed. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to learn a search policy for AGS that scales to large urban areas containing thousands of parcels, balancing exploration and exploitation and accounting for travel costs and a budget constraint. Crucially, the search policy adapts online to newly discovered information about evictions. Evaluation using eviction data for a large urban area demonstrates that the proposed framework and algorithmic approach are considerably more effective at sequentially identifying eviction cases than baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Structure Refinement with Energy-based Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained widespread attention as a successful tool for analyzing graph-structured data. However, imperfect graph structure with noisy links lacks enough robustness and may damage graph representations, therefore limiting the GNNs' performance in practical tasks. Moreover, existing generative architectures fail to fit discriminative graph-related tasks. To tackle these issues, we introduce an unsupervised method based on a joint of generative training and discriminative training to learn graph structure and representation, aiming to improve the discriminative performance of generative models. We propose an Energy-based Contrastive Learning (ECL) guided Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) framework, denoted as ECL-GSR. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine energy-based models with contrastive learning for GSR. Specifically, we leverage ECL to approximate the joint distribution of sample pairs, which increases the similarity between representations of positive pairs while reducing the similarity between negative ones. Refined structure is produced by augmenting and removing edges according to the similarity metrics among node representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECL-GSR outperforms \textit{the state-of-the-art on eight benchmark datasets} in node classification. ECL-GSR achieves \textit{faster training with fewer samples and memories} against the leading baseline, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>In Defence of Post-hoc Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning in scientific research has created a fundamental tension between model opacity and scientific understanding. Whilst some advocate for intrinsically interpretable models, we introduce Computational Interpretabilism (CI) as a philosophical framework for post-hoc interpretability in scientific AI. Drawing parallels with human expertise, where post-hoc rationalisation coexists with reliable performance, CI establishes that scientific knowledge emerges through structured model interpretation when properly bounded by empirical validation. Through mediated understanding and bounded factivity, we demonstrate how post-hoc methods achieve epistemically justified insights without requiring complete mechanical transparency, resolving tensions between model complexity and scientific comprehension.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Balance Convenience and Nutrition in Meals With Long-Term Group Recommendations and Reasoning on Multimodal Recipes and its Implementation in BEACON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "A common decision made by people, whether healthy or with health conditions, is choosing meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, comprising combinations of foods for appetizer, main course, side dishes, desserts, and beverages. Often, this decision involves tradeoffs between nutritious choices (e.g., salt and sugar levels, nutrition content) and convenience (e.g., cost and accessibility, cuisine type, food source type). We present a data-driven solution for meal recommendations that considers customizable meal configurations and time horizons. This solution balances user preferences while accounting for food constituents and cooking processes. Our contributions include introducing goodness measures, a recipe conversion method from text to the recently introduced multimodal rich recipe representation (R3) format, learning methods using contextual bandits that show promising preliminary results, and the prototype, usage-inspired, BEACON system."</description>

      <title>VITRO: Vocabulary Inversion for Time-series Representation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating textual data, their pre-trained vocabularies are ill-suited for capturing the nuanced temporal dynamics and patterns inherent in time series. The discrete, symbolic nature of natural language tokens, which these vocabularies are designed to represent, does not align well with the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose VITRO. Our method adapts textual inversion optimization from the vision-language domain in order to learn a new time series per-dataset vocabulary that bridges the gap between the discrete, semantic nature of natural language and the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. We show that learnable time series-specific pseudo-word embeddings represent time series data better than existing general language model vocabularies, with VITRO-enhanced methods achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across most datasets.</description>

      <title>Extending Graph Condensation to Multi-Label Datasets: A Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As graph data grows increasingly complicate, training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale datasets presents significant challenges, including computational resource constraints, data redundancy, and transmission inefficiencies. While existing graph condensation techniques have shown promise in addressing these issues, they are predominantly designed for single-label datasets, where each node is associated with a single class label. However, many real-world applications, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics, involve multi-label graph datasets, where one node can have various related labels. To deal with this problem, we extends traditional graph condensation approaches to accommodate multi-label datasets by introducing modifications to synthetic dataset initialization and condensing optimization. Through experiments on eight real-world multi-label graph datasets, we prove the effectiveness of our method. In experiment, the GCond framework, combined with K-Center initialization and binary cross-entropy loss (BCELoss), achieves best performance in general. This benchmark for multi-label graph condensation not only enhances the scalability and efficiency of GNNs for multi-label graph data, but also offering substantial benefits for diverse real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Parameterized Nonlinear Fluid Dynamical Systems with a Dynamics-embedded Conditional Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven solution to accurately predict parameterized nonlinear fluid dynamical systems using a dynamics-generator conditional GAN (Dyn-cGAN) as a surrogate model. The Dyn-cGAN includes a dynamics block within a modified conditional GAN, enabling the simultaneous identification of temporal dynamics and their dependence on system parameters. The learned Dyn-cGAN model takes into account the system parameters to predict the flow fields of the system accurately. We evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of the developed Dyn-cGAN through numerical studies of various parameterized nonlinear fluid dynamical systems, including flow over a cylinder and a 2-D cavity problem, with different Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, we examine how Reynolds number affects the accuracy of the predictions for both case studies. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the number of time steps involved in the process of dynamics block training on the accuracy of predictions, and we find that an optimal value exists based on errors and mutual information relative to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware ML methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy struggles with non-associativity and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Constraints on the Expressive Power of $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Attention extends traditional attention mechanisms by capturing high-order correlations across multiple modalities, addressing the limitations of classical matrix-based attention. Meanwhile, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has shown superior performance in encoding positional information in long-context scenarios, significantly enhancing transformer models' expressiveness. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical limitations of these technologies remain underexplored. In this study, we analyze the circuit complexity of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention, showing that with polynomial precision, constant-depth layers, and linear or sublinear hidden dimension, they cannot solve fixed membership problems or $(A_{F,r})^*$ closure problems, under the assumption that $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. These findings highlight a gap between the empirical performance and theoretical constraints of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention Transformers, offering insights that could guide the development of more theoretically grounded approaches to Transformer model design and scaling.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gradient Averaging in Parallel Optimization: Improved Robustness through Gradient Agreement Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Gradient Agreement Filtering (GAF) to improve on gradient averaging in distributed deep learning optimization. Traditional distributed data-parallel stochastic gradient descent involves averaging gradients of microbatches to calculate a macrobatch gradient that is then used to update model parameters. We find that gradients across microbatches are often orthogonal or negatively correlated, especially in late stages of training, which leads to memorization of the training set, reducing generalization. In this paper, we introduce a simple, computationally effective way to reduce gradient variance by computing the cosine distance between micro-gradients during training and filtering out conflicting updates prior to averaging. We improve validation accuracy with significantly smaller microbatch sizes. We also show this reduces memorizing noisy labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on standard image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-100N-Fine. We show this technique consistently outperforms validation accuracy, in some cases by up to 18.2\% compared to traditional training approaches while reducing the computation required nearly an order of magnitude because we can now rely on smaller microbatch sizes without destabilizing training.</description>

      <title>Diverse Concept Proposals for Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models are interpretable predictive models that are often used in domains where model trust is a key priority, such as healthcare. They identify a small number of human-interpretable concepts in the data, which they then use to make predictions. Learning relevant concepts from data proves to be a challenging task. The most predictive concepts may not align with expert intuition, thus, failing interpretability with no recourse. Our proposed approach identifies a number of predictive concepts that explain the data. By offering multiple alternative explanations, we allow the human expert to choose the one that best aligns with their expectation. To demonstrate our method, we show that it is able discover all possible concept representations on a synthetic dataset. On EHR data, our model was able to identify 4 out of the 5 pre-defined concepts without supervision.</description>

      <title>An Attention-based Framework with Multistation Information for Earthquake Early Warnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems play crucial roles in reducing the risk of seismic disasters. Previously, the dominant modeling system was the single-station models. Such models digest signal data received at a given station and predict earth-quake parameters, such as the p-phase arrival time, intensity, and magnitude at that location. Various methods have demonstrated adequate performance. However, most of these methods present the challenges of the difficulty of speeding up the alarm time, providing early warning for distant areas, and considering global information to enhance performance. Recently, deep learning has significantly impacted many fields, including seismology. Thus, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework, called SENSE, for the intensity prediction task of earthquake early warning systems. To explicitly consider global information from a regional or national perspective, the input to SENSE comprises statistics from a set of stations in a given region or country. The SENSE model is designed to learn the relationships among the set of input stations and the locality-specific characteristics of each station. Thus, SENSE is not only expected to provide more reliable forecasts by considering multistation data but also has the ability to provide early warnings to distant areas that have not yet received signals. This study conducted extensive experiments on datasets from Taiwan and Japan. The results revealed that SENSE can deliver competitive or even better performances compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Randomized Reductions and Program Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correctness of computations remains a significant challenge in computer science, with traditional approaches relying on automated testing or formal verification. Self-testing/correcting programs introduce an alternative paradigm, allowing a program to verify and correct its own outputs via randomized reductions, a concept that previously required manual derivation. In this paper, we present Bitween, a method and tool for automated learning of randomized (self)-reductions and program properties in numerical programs. Bitween combines symbolic analysis and machine learning, with a surprising finding: polynomial-time linear regression, a basic optimization method, is not only sufficient but also highly effective for deriving complex randomized self-reductions and program invariants, often outperforming sophisticated mixed-integer linear programming solvers. We establish a theoretical framework for learning these reductions and introduce RSR-Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating Bitween's capabilities on scientific and machine learning functions. Our empirical results show that Bitween surpasses state-of-the-art tools in scalability, stability, and sample efficiency when evaluated on nonlinear invariant benchmarks like NLA-DigBench. Bitween is open-source as a Python package and accessible via a web interface that supports C language programs.</description>

      <title>Neural Conformal Control for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a neural network conformal prediction method for time series that enhances adaptivity in non-stationary environments. Our approach acts as a neural controller designed to achieve desired target coverage, leveraging auxiliary multi-view data with neural network encoders in an end-to-end manner to further enhance adaptivity. Additionally, our model is designed to enhance the consistency of prediction intervals in different quantiles by integrating monotonicity constraints and leverages data from related tasks to boost few-shot learning performance. Using real-world datasets from epidemics, electric demand, weather, and others, we empirically demonstrate significant improvements in coverage and probabilistic accuracy, and find that our method is the only one that combines good calibration with consistency in prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control for Fine-tuning Diffusion Models: Optimality, Regularity, and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Online Continual Learning with Plug-and-Play State Space Model and Class-Conditional Mixture of Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online continual learning (OCL) seeks to learn new tasks from data streams that appear only once, while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. Most existing methods rely on replay, focusing on enhancing memory retention through regularization or distillation. However, they often overlook the adaptability of the model, limiting the ability to learn generalizable and discriminative features incrementally from online training data. To address this, we introduce a plug-and-play module, S6MOD, which can be integrated into most existing methods and directly improve adaptability. Specifically, S6MOD introduces an extra branch after the backbone, where a mixture of discretization selectively adjusts parameters in a selective state space model, enriching selective scan patterns such that the model can adaptively select the most sensitive discretization method for current dynamics. We further design a class-conditional routing algorithm for dynamic, uncertainty-based adjustment and implement a contrastive discretization loss to optimize it. Extensive experiments combining our module with various models demonstrate that S6MOD significantly enhances model adaptability, leading to substantial performance gains and achieving the state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>Learning Sign Language Representation using CNN LSTM, 3DCNN, CNN RNN LSTM and CCN TD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Sign Language Learning applications focus on the demonstration of the sign in the hope that the student will copy a sign correctly. In these cases, only a teacher can confirm that the sign was completed correctly, by reviewing a video captured manually. Sign Language Translation is a widely explored field in visual recognition. This paper seeks to explore the algorithms that will allow for real-time, video sign translation, and grading of sign language accuracy for new sign language users. This required algorithms capable of recognizing and processing spatial and temporal features. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and identify the best neural network algorithm that can facilitate a sign language tuition system of this nature. Modern popular algorithms including CNN and 3DCNN are compared on a dataset not yet explored, Trinidad and Tobago Sign Language as well as an American Sign Language dataset. The 3DCNN algorithm was found to be the best performing neural network algorithm from these systems with 91% accuracy in the TTSL dataset and 83% accuracy in the ASL dataset.</description>

      <title>Developing Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Based on Autoencoder-CNN-GANs Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

      <title>Sharper Error Bounds in Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering Using Eigenvalue Proportion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to integrate complementary information from multiple views to enhance clustering performance. Late Fusion Multi-View Clustering (LFMVC) has shown promise by synthesizing diverse clustering results into a unified consensus. However, current LFMVC methods struggle with noisy and redundant partitions and often fail to capture high-order correlations across views. To address these limitations, we present a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization error bounds of multiple kernel $k$-means, leveraging local Rademacher complexity and principal eigenvalue proportions. Our analysis establishes a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, significantly improving upon the existing rate in the order of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k/n})$. Building on this insight, we propose a low-pass graph filtering strategy within a multiple linear $k$-means framework to mitigate noise and redundancy, further refining the principal eigenvalue proportion and enhancing clustering accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clustering performance and robustness.

      <title>Accelerating AIGC Services with Latent Action Diffusion Scheduling in Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has gained significant popularity for creating diverse content. Current AIGC models primarily focus on content quality within a centralized framework, resulting in a high service delay and negative user experiences. However, not only does the workload of an AIGC task depend on the AIGC model's complexity rather than the amount of data, but the large model and its multi-layer encoder structure also result in a huge demand for computational and memory resources. These unique characteristics pose new challenges in its modeling, deployment, and scheduling at edge networks. Thus, we model an offloading problem among edges for providing real AIGC services and propose LAD-TS, a novel Latent Action Diffusion-based Task Scheduling method that orchestrates multiple edge servers for expedited AIGC services. The LAD-TS generates a near-optimal offloading decision by leveraging the diffusion model's conditional generation capability and the reinforcement learning's environment interaction ability, thereby minimizing the service delays under multiple resource constraints. Meanwhile, a latent action diffusion strategy is designed to guide decision generation by utilizing historical action probability, enabling rapid achievement of near-optimal decisions. Furthermore, we develop DEdgeAI, a prototype edge system with a refined AIGC model deployment to implement and evaluate our LAD-TS method. DEdgeAI provides a real AIGC service for users, demonstrating up to 29.18% shorter service delays than the current five representative AIGC platforms. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/ChangfuXu/DEdgeAI/.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Adversarial Training on Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely applied to harden learning-based classifiers against adversarial evasive attacks. However, its effectiveness in identifying and strengthening vulnerable areas of the model's decision space while maintaining high performance on clean data of malware classifiers remains an under-explored area. In this context, the robustness that AT achieves has often been assessed against unrealistic or weak adversarial attacks, which negatively affect performance on clean data and are arguably no longer threats. Previous work seems to suggest robustness is a task-dependent property of AT. We instead argue it is a more complex problem that requires exploring AT and the intertwined roles played by certain factors within data, feature representations, classifiers, and robust optimization settings, as well as proper evaluation factors, such as the realism of evasion attacks, to gain a true sense of AT's effectiveness. In our paper, we address this gap by systematically exploring the role such factors have in hardening malware classifiers through AT. Contrary to recent prior work, a key observation of our research and extensive experiments confirm the hypotheses that all such factors influence the actual effectiveness of AT, as demonstrated by the varying degrees of success from our empirical analysis. We identify five evaluation pitfalls that affect state-of-the-art studies and summarize our insights in ten takeaways to draw promising research directions toward better understanding the factors' settings under which adversarial training works at best.</description>

      <title>Towards Macro-AUC oriented Imbalanced Multi-Label Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Continual Learning (CL), while existing work primarily focuses on the multi-class classification task, there has been limited research on Multi-Label Learning (MLL). In practice, MLL datasets are often class-imbalanced, making it inherently challenging, a problem that is even more acute in CL. Due to its sensitivity to imbalance, Macro-AUC is an appropriate and widely used measure in MLL. However, there is no research to optimize Macro-AUC in MLCL specifically. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a new memory replay-based method to tackle the imbalance issue for Macro-AUC-oriented MLCL. Specifically, inspired by recent theory work, we propose a new Reweighted Label-Distribution-Aware Margin (RLDAM) loss. Furthermore, to be compatible with the RLDAM loss, a new memory-updating strategy named Weight Retain Updating (WRU) is proposed to maintain the numbers of positive and negative instances of the original dataset in memory. Theoretically, we provide superior generalization analyses of the RLDAM-based algorithm in terms of Macro-AUC, separately in batch MLL and MLCL settings. This is the first work to offer theoretical generalization analyses in MLCL to our knowledge. Finally, a series of experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method over several baselines. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ML-Group-SDU/Macro-AUC-CL.</description>

      <title>Conditional Deep Canonical Time Warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal alignment of sequences is a fundamental challenge in many applications, such as computer vision and bioinformatics, where local time shifting needs to be accounted for. Misalignment can lead to poor model generalization, especially in high-dimensional sequences. Existing methods often struggle with optimization when dealing with high-dimensional sparse data, falling into poor alignments. Feature selection is frequently used to enhance model performance for sparse data. However, a fixed set of selected features would not generally work for dynamically changing sequences and would need to be modified based on the state of the sequence. Therefore, modifying the selected feature based on contextual input would result in better alignment. Our suggested method, Conditional Deep Canonical Temporal Time Warping (CDCTW), is designed for temporal alignment in sparse temporal data to address these challenges. CDCTW enhances alignment accuracy for high dimensional time-dependent views be performing dynamic time warping on data embedded in maximally correlated subspace which handles sparsity with novel feature selection method. We validate the effectiveness of CDCTW through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating superior performance over previous techniques.</description>

      <title>Sch\"odinger Bridge Type Diffusion Models as an Extension of Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models use time-forward and backward stochastic differential equations to connect the data and prior distributions. While conventional diffusion models (e.g., score-based models) only learn the backward process, more flexible frameworks have been proposed to also learn the forward process by employing the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB). However, due to the complexity of the mathematical structure behind SB-type models, we can not easily give an intuitive understanding of their objective function. In this work, we propose a unified framework to construct diffusion models by reinterpreting the SB-type models as an extension of variational autoencoders. In this context, the data processing inequality plays a crucial role. As a result, we find that the objective function consists of the prior loss and drift matching parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease, especially in its early stages, can be a challenging task. The application of machine learning techniques helps improve the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson disease detection but only few studies have presented work towards the prediction of disease progression. In this research work, Long Short Term Memory LSTM was trained using the diagnostic features on Parkinson patients speech signals, to predict the disease progression while a Multilayer Perceptron MLP was trained on the same diagnostic features to detect the disease. Diagnostic features selected using two well-known feature selection methods named Relief-F and Sequential Forward Selection and applied on LSTM and MLP have shown to accurately predict the disease progression as stage 2 and 3 and its existence respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Semi-Supervised Learning in Open Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to improve performance by exploiting unlabeled data when labels are scarce. Conventional SSL studies typically assume close environments where important factors (e.g., label, feature, distribution) between labeled and unlabeled data are consistent. However, more practical tasks involve open environments where important factors between labeled and unlabeled data are inconsistent. It has been reported that exploiting inconsistent unlabeled data causes severe performance degradation, even worse than the simple supervised learning baseline. Manually verifying the quality of unlabeled data is not desirable, therefore, it is important to study robust SSL with inconsistent unlabeled data in open environments. This paper briefly introduces some advances in this line of research, focusing on techniques concerning label, feature, and data distribution inconsistency in SSL, and presents the evaluation benchmarks. Open research problems are also discussed for reference purposes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Contrastive Explanations on Demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work revealed a tight connection between adversarial robustness and restricted forms of symbolic explanations, namely distance-based (formal) explanations. This connection is significant because it represents a first step towards making the computation of symbolic explanations as efficient as deciding the existence of adversarial examples, especially for highly complex machine learning (ML) models. However, a major performance bottleneck remains, because of the very large number of features that ML models may possess, in particular for deep neural networks. This paper proposes novel algorithms to compute the so-called contrastive explanations for ML models with a large number of features, by leveraging on adversarial robustness. Furthermore, the paper also proposes novel algorithms for listing explanations and finding smallest contrastive explanations. The experimental results demonstrate the performance gains achieved by the novel algorithms proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Free the Design Space of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in &lt;0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>NoiseHGNN: Synthesized Similarity Graph-Based Neural Network For Noised Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graph data environments intrinsically exist noise (e.g., link and structure errors) that inevitably disturb the effectiveness of graph representation and downstream learning tasks. For homogeneous graphs, the latest works use original node features to synthesize a similarity graph that can correct the structure of the noised graph. This idea is based on the homogeneity assumption, which states that similar nodes in the homogeneous graph tend to have direct links in the original graph. However, similar nodes in heterogeneous graphs usually do not have direct links, which can not be used to correct the original noise graph. This causes a significant challenge in noised heterogeneous graph learning. To this end, this paper proposes a novel synthesized similarity-based graph neural network compatible with noised heterogeneous graph learning. First, we calculate the original feature similarities of all nodes to synthesize a similarity-based high-order graph. Second, we propose a similarity-aware encoder to embed original and synthesized graphs with shared parameters. Then, instead of graph-to-graph supervising, we synchronously supervise the original and synthesized graph embeddings to predict the same labels. Meanwhile, a target-based graph extracted from the synthesized graph contrasts the structure of the metapath-based graph extracted from the original graph to learn the mutual information. Extensive experiments in numerous real-world datasets show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art records in the noised heterogeneous graph learning tasks. In highlights, +5$\sim$6\% improvements are observed in several noised datasets compared with previous SOTA methods. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kg-cc/NoiseHGNN.</description>

      <title>On the Local Complexity of Linear Regions in Deep ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the local complexity of a neural network with continuous piecewise linear activations as a measure of the density of linear regions over an input data distribution. We show theoretically that ReLU networks that learn low-dimensional feature representations have a lower local complexity. This allows us to connect recent empirical observations on feature learning at the level of the weight matrices with concrete properties of the learned functions. In particular, we show that the local complexity serves as an upper bound on the total variation of the function over the input data distribution and thus that feature learning can be related to adversarial robustness. Lastly, we consider how optimization drives ReLU networks towards solutions with lower local complexity. Overall, this work contributes a theoretical framework towards relating geometric properties of ReLU networks to different aspects of learning such as feature learning and representation cost.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Credit Card Fraud Detection via Attribute-Driven Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit card fraud incurs a considerable cost for both cardholders and issuing banks. Contemporary methods apply machine learning-based classifiers to detect fraudulent behavior from labeled transaction records. But labeled data are usually a small proportion of billions of real transactions due to expensive labeling costs, which implies that they do not well exploit many natural features from unlabeled data. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised graph neural network for fraud detection. Specifically, we leverage transaction records to construct a temporal transaction graph, which is composed of temporal transactions (nodes) and interactions (edges) among them. Then we pass messages among the nodes through a Gated Temporal Attention Network (GTAN) to learn the transaction representation. We further model the fraud patterns through risk propagation among transactions. The extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world transaction dataset and two publicly available fraud detection datasets. The result shows that our proposed method, namely GTAN, outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on three fraud detection datasets. Semi-supervised experiments demonstrate the excellent fraud detection performance of our model with only a tiny proportion of labeled data.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding how attention mechanism works in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention mechanism has been extensively integrated within mainstream neural network architectures, such as Transformers and graph attention networks. Yet, its underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence? Are there any connections between it and traditional machine learning algorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using classic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering, and supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity computation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles but operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention mechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information propagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the self-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through continuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric and certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed into a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order analysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This study aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism through physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism called metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to facilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms self-attention regarding training efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Navigating Data Corruption in Machine Learning: Balancing Quality, Quantity, and Imputation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data corruption, including missing and noisy data, poses significant challenges in real-world machine learning. This study investigates the effects of data corruption on model performance and explores strategies to mitigate these effects through two experimental setups: supervised learning with NLP tasks (NLP-SL) and deep reinforcement learning for traffic signal optimization (Signal-RL). We analyze the relationship between data corruption levels and model performance, evaluate the effectiveness of data imputation methods, and assess the utility of enlarging datasets to address data corruption.
  Our results show that model performance under data corruption follows a diminishing return curve, modeled by the exponential function. Missing data, while detrimental, is less harmful than noisy data, which causes severe performance degradation and training instability, particularly in sequential decision-making tasks like Signal-RL. Imputation strategies involve a trade-off: they recover missing information but may introduce noise. Their effectiveness depends on imputation accuracy and corruption ratio. We identify distinct regions in the imputation advantage heatmap, including an "imputation advantageous corner" and an "imputation disadvantageous edge" and classify tasks as "noise-sensitive" or "noise-insensitive" based on their decision boundaries.
  Furthermore, we find that increasing dataset size mitigates but cannot fully overcome the effects of data corruption. The marginal utility of additional data diminishes as corruption increases. An empirical rule emerges: approximately 30% of the data is critical for determining performance, while the remaining 70% has minimal impact.
  These findings provide actionable insights into data preprocessing, imputation strategies, and data collection practices, guiding the development of robust machine learning systems in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised graph representation learning (SSGRL) is a representation learning paradigm used to reduce or avoid manual labeling. An essential part of SSGRL is graph data augmentation. Existing methods usually rely on heuristics commonly identified through trial and error and are effective only within some application domains. Also, it is not clear why one heuristic is better than another. Moreover, recent studies have argued against some techniques (e.g., dropout: that can change the properties of molecular graphs or destroy relevant signals for graph-based document classification tasks).
  In this study, we propose a novel data-driven SSGRL approach that automatically learns a suitable graph augmentation from the signal encoded in the graph (i.e., the nodes' predictive feature and topological information). We propose two complementary approaches that produce learnable feature and topological augmentations. The former learns multi-view augmentation of node features, and the latter learns a high-order view of the topology. Moreover, the augmentations are jointly learned with the representation. Our approach is general that it can be applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. We perform extensive experiments on node classification (using nine homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets) and graph property prediction (using another eight datasets). The results show that the proposed method matches or outperforms the SOTA SSGRL baselines and performs similarly to semi-supervised methods.

      <title>Point-DeepONet: A Deep Operator Network Integrating PointNet for Nonlinear Analysis of Non-Parametric 3D Geometries and Load Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear structural analyses in engineering often require extensive finite element simulations, limiting their applicability in design optimization, uncertainty quantification, and real-time control. Conventional deep learning surrogates, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and fourier neural operators (FNOs), face challenges with complex non-parametric three-dimensional (3D) geometries, directionally varying loads, and high-fidelity predictions on unstructured meshes. This work presents Point-DeepONet, an operator-learning-based surrogate that integrates PointNet into the DeepONet framework. By directly processing non-parametric point clouds and incorporating signed distance functions (SDF) for geometric context, Point-DeepONet accurately predicts three-dimensional displacement and von Mises stress fields without mesh parameterization or retraining. Trained using only about 5,000 nodes (2.5% of the original 200,000-node mesh), Point-DeepONet can still predict the entire mesh at high fidelity, achieving a coefficient of determination reaching 0.987 for displacement and 0.923 for von Mises stress under a horizontal load case. Compared to nonlinear finite element analyses that require about 19.32 minutes per case, Point-DeepONet provides predictions in mere seconds-approximately 400 times faster-while maintaining excellent scalability and accuracy with increasing dataset sizes. These findings highlight the potential of Point-DeepONet to enable rapid, high-fidelity structural analyses, ultimately supporting more effective design exploration and informed decision-making in complex engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Attacks via Injecting Homogeneous Nodes into Elite Hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing approaches focus on hypergraph modification attacks guided by gradients, overlooking node spanning in the hypergraph and the group identity of hyperedges, thereby resulting in limited attack performance and detectable attacks. In this manuscript, we present a novel framework, i.e., Hypergraph Attacks via Injecting Homogeneous Nodes into Elite Hyperedges (IE-Attack), to tackle these challenges. Initially, utilizing the node spanning in the hypergraph, we propose the elite hyperedges sampler to identify hyperedges to be injected. Subsequently, a node generator utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is proposed to generate the homogeneous node with the group identity of hyperedges. Finally, by injecting the homogeneous node into elite hyperedges, IE-Attack improves the attack performance and enhances the imperceptibility of attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on five authentic datasets to validate the effectiveness of IE-Attack and the corresponding superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Threat of Fraud Gangs to Graph Neural Networks: Multi-Target Graph Injection Attacks against GNN-Based Fraud Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective tool for fraud detection, identifying fraudulent users, and uncovering malicious behaviors. However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing a suitable deep learning architecture for multimodal data fusion is a challenging task, as it requires the effective integration and processing of diverse data types, each with distinct structures and characteristics. In this paper, we introduce MixMAS, a novel framework for sampling-based mixer architecture search tailored to multimodal learning. Our approach automatically selects the optimal MLP-based architecture for a given multimodal machine learning (MML) task. Specifically, MixMAS utilizes a sampling-based micro-benchmarking strategy to explore various combinations of modality-specific encoders, fusion functions, and fusion networks, systematically identifying the architecture that best meets the task's performance metrics.</description>

      <title>GeFL: Model-Agnostic Federated Learning with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm in distributed learning while preserving the privacy of users. However, the increasing size of recent models makes it unaffordable for a few users to encompass the model. It leads the users to adopt heterogeneous models based on their diverse computing capabilities and network bandwidth. Correspondingly, FL with heterogeneous models should be addressed, given that FL typically involves training a single global model. In this paper, we propose Generative Model-Aided Federated Learning (GeFL), incorporating a generative model that aggregates global knowledge across users of heterogeneous models. Our experiments on various classification tasks demonstrate notable performance improvements of GeFL compared to baselines, as well as limitations in terms of privacy and scalability. To tackle these concerns, we introduce a novel framework, GeFL-F. It trains target networks aided by feature-generative models.

      <title>An Overview and Discussion of the Suitability of Existing Speech Datasets to Train Machine Learning Models for Collective Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report characterized the suitability of existing datasets for devising new Machine Learning models, decision making methods, and analysis algorithms to improve Collaborative Problem Solving and then enumerated requirements for future datasets to be devised. Problem solving was assumed to be performed in teams of about three, four members, which talked to each other. A dataset consists of the speech recordings of such teams. The characterization methodology was based on metrics that capture cognitive, social, and emotional activities and situations. The report presented the analysis of a large group of datasets developed for Spoken Language Understanding, a research area with some similarity to Collaborative Problem Solving.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Federated Learning Models Subject to Label-Flipping Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we empirically analyze adversarial attacks on selected federated learning models. The specific learning models considered are Multinominal Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), %Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). For each model, we simulate label-flipping attacks, experimenting extensively with 10 federated clients and 100 federated clients. We vary the percentage of adversarial clients from 10% to 100% and, simultaneously, the percentage of labels flipped by each adversarial client is also varied from 10% to 100%. Among other results, we find that models differ in their inherent robustness to the two vectors in our label-flipping attack, i.e., the percentage of adversarial clients, and the percentage of labels flipped by each adversarial client. We discuss the potential practical implications of our results.</description>

      <title>FedGIG: Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA), which can recover private training data from shared gradients. However, existing methods are designed for dense, continuous data such as images or vectorized texts, and cannot be directly applied to sparse and discrete graph data. This paper first explores GIA's impact on Federated Graph Learning (FGL) and introduces Graph Inversion from Gradient in Federated Learning (FedGIG), a novel GIA method specifically designed for graph-structured data. FedGIG includes the adjacency matrix constraining module, which ensures the sparsity and discreteness of the reconstructed graph data, and the subgraph reconstruction module, which is designed to complete missing common subgraph structures. Extensive experiments on molecular datasets demonstrate FedGIG's superior accuracy over existing GIA techniques.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Bilevel Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, a hierarchical mathematical framework where one optimization problem is nested within another, has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex decision-making processes in various fields such as economics, engineering, and machine learning. This paper focuses on bilevel optimization where both upper-level and lower-level functions are black boxes and expensive to evaluate. We propose a Bayesian Optimization framework that models the upper and lower-level functions as Gaussian processes over the combined space of upper and lower-level decisions, allowing us to exploit knowledge transfer between different sub-problems. Additionally, we propose a novel acquisition function for this model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly sample-efficient and outperforms existing methods in finding high-quality solutions.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Language Generation With Breadth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, introduced by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24], building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin [Ang79]. [KM24] proposed an algorithm that generates strings from any countable language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually outputs strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices breadth, i.e., the ability to generate all strings in $K$. A key open question in [KM24] is whether this trade-off between consistency and breadth is inherrent.
  Recent works proposed different notions of consistent generation with breadth. Kalavasis, Mehrotra, and Velegkas [KVM24] introduced three definitions: generation with exact breadth, approximate breadth, and unambiguous generation. Concurrently and independently, Charikar and Pabbaraju [CP24a] proposed exhaustive generation. Both works examined when generation with these notions of breadth is possible.
  Building on [CP24a, KVM24], we fully characterize language generation for these notions and their natural combinations. For exact breadth, we provide an unconditional lower bound, removing a technical condition from [KVM24] and extending the result of [CP24a] that holds for specific collections of languages. We show that generation with exact breadth is characterized by Angluin's condition for identification. We further introduce a weaker version of Angluin's condition that tightly characterizes both approximate breadth and exhaustive generation, proving their equivalence. Additionally, we show that unambiguous generation is also characterized by Angluin's condition as a special case of a broader result. Finally, we strengthen [KVM24] by giving unconditional lower bounds for stable generators, showing that Angluin's condition characterizes the previous breadth notions for stable generators. This shows a separation between stable and unstable generation with approximate breadth.</description>

      <title>Graph Structure Learning for Spatial-Temporal Imputation: Adapting to Node and Feature Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.</description>

      <title>Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.</description>

      <title>FedVCK: Non-IID Robust and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Valuable Condensed Knowledge for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning has become a promising solution for collaboration among medical institutions. However, data owned by each institution would be highly heterogeneous and the distribution is always non-independent and identical distribution (non-IID), resulting in client drift and unsatisfactory performance. Despite existing federated learning methods attempting to solve the non-IID problems, they still show marginal advantages but rely on frequent communication which would incur high costs and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning method: \textbf{Fed}erated learning via \textbf{V}aluable \textbf{C}ondensed \textbf{K}nowledge (FedVCK). We enhance the quality of condensed knowledge and select the most necessary knowledge guided by models, to tackle the non-IID problem within limited communication budgets effectively. Specifically, on the client side, we condense the knowledge of each client into a small dataset and further enhance the condensation procedure with latent distribution constraints, facilitating the effective capture of high-quality knowledge. During each round, we specifically target and condense knowledge that has not been assimilated by the current model, thereby preventing unnecessary repetition of homogeneous knowledge and minimizing the frequency of communications required. On the server side, we propose relational supervised contrastive learning to provide more supervision signals to aid the global model updating. Comprehensive experiments across various medical tasks show that FedVCK can outperform state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it's non-IID robust and communication-efficient.</description>

      <title>Efficient Aircraft Design Optimization Using Multi-Fidelity Models and Multi-fidelity Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aircraft design optimization traditionally relies on computationally expensive simulation techniques such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Volume Method (FVM), which, while accurate, can significantly slow down the design iteration process. The challenge lies in reducing the computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy for quick evaluations of multiple design alternatives. This research explores advanced methods, including surrogate models, reduced-order models (ROM), and multi-fidelity machine learning techniques, to achieve more efficient aircraft design evaluations. Specifically, the study investigates the application of Multi-fidelity Physics-Informed Neural Networks (MPINN) and autoencoders for manifold alignment, alongside the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for refining design geometries. Through a proof-of-concept task, the research demonstrates the ability to predict high-fidelity results from low-fidelity simulations, offering a path toward faster and more cost effective aircraft design iterations.</description>

      <title>Structure Learning in Gaussian Graphical Models from Glauber Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian graphical model selection is an important paradigm with numerous applications, including biological network modeling, financial network modeling, and social network analysis. Traditional approaches assume access to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address Gaussian graphical model selection under observations from a more realistic dependent stochastic process known as Glauber dynamics. Glauber dynamics, also called the Gibbs sampler, is a Markov chain that sequentially updates the variables of the underlying model based on the statistics of the remaining model. Such models, aside from frequently being employed to generate samples from complex multivariate distributions, naturally arise in various settings, such as opinion consensus in social networks and clearing/stock-price dynamics in financial networks.
  In contrast to the extensive body of existing work, we present the first algorithm for Gaussian graphical model selection when data are sampled according to the Glauber dynamics. We provide theoretical guarantees on the computational and statistical complexity of the proposed algorithm's structure learning performance. Additionally, we provide information-theoretic lower bounds on the statistical complexity and show that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal for a broad class of problems.</description>

      <title>GOPT: Generalizable Online 3D Bin Packing via Transformer-based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05344v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic object packing has broad practical applications in the logistics and automation industry, often formulated by researchers as the online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). However, existing DRL-based methods primarily focus on enhancing performance in limited packing environments while neglecting the ability to generalize across multiple environments characterized by different bin dimensions. To this end, we propose GOPT, a generalizable online 3D Bin Packing approach via Transformer-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, we design a Placement Generator module to yield finite subspaces as placement candidates and the representation of the bin. Second, we propose a Packing Transformer, which fuses the features of the items and bin, to identify the spatial correlation between the item to be packed and available sub-spaces within the bin. Coupling these two components enables GOPT's ability to perform inference on bins of varying dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that GOPT not only achieves superior performance against the baselines, but also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the deployment with a robot showcases the practical applicability of our method in the real world. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiong5Heng/GOPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare diagnosis demands systematic frameworks that can handle complex medical scenarios while maintaining specialized expertise. We present KG4Diagnosis, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that combines LLMs with automated knowledge graph construction, encompassing 362 common diseases across medical specialties. Our framework mirrors real-world medical systems through a two-tier architecture: a general practitioner (GP) agent for initial assessment and triage, coordinating with specialized agents for in-depth diagnosis in specific domains. The core innovation lies in our end-to-end knowledge graph generation methodology, incorporating: (1) semantic-driven entity and relation extraction optimized for medical terminology, (2) multi-dimensional decision relationship reconstruction from unstructured medical texts, and (3) human-guided reasoning for knowledge expansion. KG4Diagnosis serves as an extensible foundation for specialized medical diagnosis systems, with capabilities to incorporate new diseases and medical knowledge. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration of domain-specific enhancements, making it valuable for developing targeted medical diagnosis systems. We provide architectural guidelines and protocols to facilitate adoption across medical contexts.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Mental Imagery Task Adaptation via Ensemble of Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely researched for neural decoding in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) as it is non-invasive, portable, and economical. However, EEG signals suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability, leading to poor performance. Recent technological advancements have led to deep learning (DL) models that have achieved high performance in various fields. However, such large models are compute- and resource-intensive and are a bottleneck for real-time neural decoding. Data distribution shift can be handled with the help of domain adaptation techniques of transfer learning (fine-tuning) and adversarial training that requires model parameter updates according to the target domain. One such recent technique is Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which requires only a small fraction of the total trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the whole model. Therefore, we explored PEFT methods for adapting EEG-based mental imagery tasks. We considered two mental imagery tasks: speech imagery and motor imagery, as both of these tasks are instrumental in post-stroke neuro-rehabilitation. We proposed a novel ensemble of weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation methods, EDoRA, for parameter-efficient mental imagery task adaptation through EEG signal classification. The performance of the proposed PEFT method is validated on two publicly available datasets, one speech imagery, and the other motor imagery dataset. In extensive experiments and analysis, the proposed method has performed better than full fine-tune and state-of-the-art PEFT methods for mental imagery EEG classification.</description>

      <title>RUL forecasting for wind turbine predictive maintenance based on deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</description>

      <title>CPFI-EIT: A CNN-PINN Framework for Full-Inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography on Non-Smooth Conductivity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to address the challenging problem of full-inverse electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is a noninvasive imaging technique that reconstructs the spatial distribution of internal conductivity based on boundary voltage measurements from injected currents. This method has applications across medical imaging, multiphase flow detection, and tactile sensing. However, solving EIT involves a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) derived from Maxwell's equations, posing significant computational challenges as an ill-posed inverse problem. Existing PINN approaches primarily address semi-inverse EIT, assuming full access to internal potential data, which limits practical applications in realistic, full-inverse scenarios. Our framework employs a forward CNN-based supervised network to map differential boundary voltage measurements to a discrete potential distribution under fixed Neumann boundary conditions, while an inverse PINN-based unsupervised network enforces PDE constraints for conductivity reconstruction. Instead of traditional automatic differentiation, we introduce discrete numerical differentiation to bridge the forward and inverse networks, effectively decoupling them, enhancing modularity, and reducing computational demands. We validate our framework under realistic conditions, using a 16-electrode setup and rigorous testing on complex conductivity distributions with sharp boundaries, without Gaussian smoothing. This approach demonstrates robust flexibility and improved applicability in full-inverse EIT, establishing a practical solution for real-world imaging challenges.</description>

      <title>Decoding individual words from non-invasive brain recordings across 723 participants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has recently enabled the decoding of language from the neural activity of a few participants with electrodes implanted inside their brain. However, reliably decoding words from non-invasive recordings remains an open challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel deep learning pipeline to decode individual words from non-invasive electro- (EEG) and magneto-encephalography (MEG) signals. We train and evaluate our approach on an unprecedentedly large number of participants (723) exposed to five million words either written or spoken in English, French or Dutch. Our model outperforms existing methods consistently across participants, devices, languages, and tasks, and can decode words absent from the training set. Our analyses highlight the importance of the recording device and experimental protocol: MEG and reading are easier to decode than EEG and listening, respectively, and it is preferable to collect a large amount of data per participant than to repeat stimuli across a large number of participants. Furthermore, decoding performance consistently increases with the amount of (i) data used for training and (ii) data used for averaging during testing. Finally, single-word predictions show that our model effectively relies on word semantics but also captures syntactic and surface properties such as part-of-speech, word length and even individual letters, especially in the reading condition. Overall, our findings delineate the path and remaining challenges towards building non-invasive brain decoders for natural language.</description>

      <title>A Beginner's Guide to Power and Energy Measurement and Estimation for Computing and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerns about the environmental footprint of machine learning are increasing. While studies of energy use and emissions of ML models are a growing subfield, most ML researchers and developers still do not incorporate energy measurement as part of their work practices. While measuring energy is a crucial step towards reducing carbon footprint, it is also not straightforward. This paper introduces the main considerations necessary for making sound use of energy measurement tools and interpreting energy estimates, including the use of at-the-wall versus on-device measurements, sampling strategies and best practices, common sources of error, and proxy measures. It also contains practical tips and real-world scenarios that illustrate how these considerations come into play. It concludes with a call to action for improving the state of the art of measurement methods and standards for facilitating robust comparisons between diverse hardware and software environments.</description>

      <title>MANGO: Multimodal Acuity traNsformer for intelliGent ICU Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of patient acuity in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is vital to ensure timely and appropriate interventions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly improved the accuracy of acuity predictions. However, prior studies using machine learning for acuity prediction have predominantly relied on electronic health records (EHR) data, often overlooking other critical aspects of ICU stay, such as patient mobility, environmental factors, and facial cues indicating pain or agitation. To address this gap, we present MANGO: the Multimodal Acuity traNsformer for intelliGent ICU Outcomes, designed to enhance the prediction of patient acuity states, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. We collected a multimodal dataset ICU-Multimodal, incorporating four key modalities, EHR data, wearable sensor data, video of patient's facial cues, and ambient sensor data, which we utilized to train MANGO. The MANGO model employs a multimodal feature fusion network powered by Transformer masked self-attention method, enabling it to capture and learn complex interactions across these diverse data modalities even when some modalities are absent. Our results demonstrated that integrating multiple modalities significantly improved the model's ability to predict acuity status, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. The best-performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79) for predicting transitions in acuity status and the need for life-sustaining therapy, while 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69-0.89) for acuity status prediction...</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Active Sampling for Rapid Training and Calibration in BCI-P300 Across Health States and Multi-centre Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning advancements have boosted Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) performance, but their wide-scale applicability is limited due to factors like individual health, hardware variations, and cultural differences affecting neural data. Studies often focus on uniform single-site experiments in uniform settings, leading to high performance that may not translate well to real-world diversity. Deep learning models aim to enhance BCI classification accuracy, and transfer learning has been suggested to adapt models to individual neural patterns using a base model trained on others' data. This approach promises better generalizability and reduced overfitting, yet challenges remain in handling diverse and imbalanced datasets from different equipment, subjects, multiple centres in different countries, and both healthy and patient populations for effective model transfer and tuning.
  In a setting characterized by maximal heterogeneity, we proposed P300 wave detection in BCIs employing a convolutional neural network fitted with adaptive transfer learning based on Poison Sampling Disk (PDS) called Active Sampling (AS), which flexibly adjusts the transition from source data to the target domain. Our results reported for subject adaptive with 40% of adaptive fine-tuning that the averaged classification accuracy improved by 5.36% and standard deviation reduced by 12.22% using two distinct, internationally replicated datasets. These results outperformed in classification accuracy, computational time, and training efficiency, mainly due to the proposed Active Sampling (AS) method for transfer learning.</description>

      <title>EEG-GMACN: Interpretable EEG Graph Mutual Attention Convolutional Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable technique to record brain electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. Analyzing EEG signals contributes to the understanding of neurological conditions and developing brain-computer interface. Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has emerged as a promising method for EEG spatial-temporal analysis, by further considering the topological relationships between electrodes. However, existing GSP studies lack interpretability of electrode importance and the credibility of prediction confidence. This work proposes an EEG Graph Mutual Attention Convolutional Network (EEG-GMACN), by introducing an 'Inverse Graph Weight Module' to output interpretable electrode graph weights, enhancing the clinical credibility and interpretability of EEG classification results. Additionally, we incorporate a mutual attention mechanism module into the model to improve its capability to distinguish critical electrodes and introduce credibility calibration to assess the uncertainty of prediction results. This study enhances the transparency and effectiveness of EEG analysis, paving the way for its widespread use in clinical and neuroscience research.</description>

Abstract: Epilepsy and epileptiform discharges are common harmful brain activities, and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used to monitor the onset status of patients. However, due to the lack of unified EEG signal acquisition standards, there are many obstacles in practical applications, especially the difficulty in transferring and using models trained on different numbers of channels. To address this issue, we proposes a neural network architecture with a single-channel feature extraction (Singal Channel Feature) model backend fusion (SCFNet). The feature extractor of the model is an RCNN network with single-channel input, which does not depend on other channels, thereby enabling easier migration to data with different numbers of channels. Experimental results show that on the IIIC-Seizure dataset, the accuracy of EEG-SCFNet has improved by 4% compared to the baseline model and also increased by 1.3% compared to the original RCNN neural network model. Even with only fine-tuning the classification head, its performance can still maintain a level comparable to the baseline. In addition, in terms of cross-dataset transfer, EEG-SCFNet can still maintain certain performance even if the channel leads are different.</description>

      <title>Cross-Species and Cross-Modality Epileptic Seizure Detection via Multi-Space Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy significantly impacts global health, affecting about 65 million people worldwide, along with various animal species. The diagnostic processes of epilepsy are often hindered by the transient and unpredictable nature of seizures. Here we propose a multi-space alignment approach based on cross-species and cross-modality electroencephalogram (EEG) data to enhance the detection capabilities and understanding of epileptic seizures. By employing deep learning techniques, including domain adaptation and knowledge distillation, our framework aligns cross-species and cross-modality EEG signals to enhance the detection capability beyond traditional within-species and with-modality models. Experiments on multiple surface and intracranial EEG datasets of humans and canines demonstrated substantial improvements in the detection accuracy, achieving over 90% AUC scores for cross-species and cross-modality seizure detection with extremely limited labeled data from the target species/modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous data from different species and modalities to improve EEG-based seizure detection performance. The approach may also be generalizable to different brain-computer interface paradigms, and suggests the possibility to combine data from different species/modalities to increase the amount of training data for large EEG models.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Data Provenance Gap Across Text, Speech and Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data. Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text, speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and video.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performance, compact electrocardiogram (ECG)-based system for automatic classification of arrhythmias, integrating machine learning approaches to achieve robust cardiac diagnostics. Our method combines a compact artificial neural network with feature enhancement techniques, including mathematical transformations, signal analysis and data extraction algorithms, to capture both morphological and time-frequency features from ECG signals. A novel aspect of this work is the addition of 17 newly engineered features, which complement the algorithm's capability to extract significant data and physiological patterns from the ECG signal. This combination enables the classifier to detect multiple arrhythmia types, such as atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and other common arrhythmic disorders. The system achieves an accuracy of 97.36% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, using a lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art models. This compact tool shows potential for clinical deployment, as well as adaptation for portable devices in long-term cardiac health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Foxtsage vs. Adam: Revolution or Evolution in Optimization?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization techniques are pivotal in neural network training, shaping both predictive performance and convergence efficiency. This study introduces Foxtsage, a novel hybrid optimisation approach that integrates the Hybrid FOX-TSA with Stochastic Gradient Descent for training Multi-Layer Perceptron models. The proposed Foxtsage method is benchmarked against the widely adopted Adam optimizer across multiple standard datasets, focusing on key performance metrics such as training loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational time. Experimental results demonstrate that Foxtsage achieves a 42.03% reduction in loss mean (Foxtsage: 9.508, Adam: 16.402) and a 42.19% improvement in loss standard deviation (Foxtsage: 20.86, Adam: 36.085), reflecting enhanced consistency and robustness. Modest improvements in accuracy mean (0.78%), precision mean (0.91%), recall mean (1.02%), and F1-score mean (0.89%) further underscore its predictive performance. However, these gains are accompanied by an increased computational cost, with a 330.87% rise in time mean (Foxtsage: 39.541 seconds, Adam: 9.177 seconds). By effectively combining the global search capabilities of FOX-TSA with the stability and adaptability of SGD, Foxtsage presents itself as a robust and viable alternative for neural network optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Open Science in AI: A Replication Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reproducibility crisis has been reported in science, but the extent to which it affects AI research is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we performed a systematic replication study including 30 highly cited AI studies relying on original materials when available. In the end, eight articles were rejected because they required access to data or hardware that was practically impossible to acquire as part of the project. Six articles were successfully reproduced, while five were partially reproduced. In total, 50% of the articles included was reproduced to some extent. The availability of code and data correlate strongly with reproducibility, as 86% of articles that shared code and data were fully or partly reproduced, while this was true for 33% of articles that shared only data. The quality of the data documentation correlates with successful replication. Poorly documented or miss-specified data will probably result in unsuccessful replication. Surprisingly, the quality of the code documentation does not correlate with successful replication. Whether the code is poorly documented, partially missing, or not versioned is not important for successful replication, as long as the code is shared. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of open science and the importance of properly documenting data work.</description>

      <title>EnhancePPG: Improving PPG-based Heart Rate Estimation with Self-Supervision and Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) estimation from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is a key feature of modern wearable devices for health and wellness monitoring. While deep learning models show promise, their performance relies on the availability of large datasets. We present EnhancePPG, a method that enhances state-of-the-art models by integrating self-supervised learning with data augmentation (DA). Our approach combines self-supervised pre-training with DA, allowing the model to learn more generalizable features, without needing more labelled data. Inspired by a U-Net-like autoencoder architecture, we utilize unsupervised PPG signal reconstruction, taking advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase combined with data augmentation, to improve state-of-the-art models' performance. Thanks to our approach and minimal modification to the state-of-the-art model, we improve the best HR estimation by 12.2%, lowering from 4.03 Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) to 3.54 BPM the error on PPG-DaLiA. Importantly, our EnhancePPG approach focuses exclusively on the training of the selected deep learning model, without significantly increasing its inference latency</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Emotion Recognition System: Integrating Facial Expressions, Body Movement, Speech, and Spoken Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional psychological evaluations rely heavily on human observation and interpretation, which are prone to subjectivity, bias, fatigue, and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this work presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that provides a standardised, objective, and data-driven tool to support evaluators, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinicians. The system integrates recognition of facial expressions, speech, spoken language, and body movement analysis to capture subtle emotional cues that are often overlooked in human evaluations. By combining these modalities, the system provides more robust and comprehensive emotional state assessment, reducing the risk of mis- and overdiagnosis. Preliminary testing in a simulated real-world condition demonstrates the system's potential to provide reliable emotional insights to improve the diagnostic accuracy. This work highlights the promise of automated multimodal analysis as a valuable complement to traditional psychological evaluation practices, with applications in clinical and therapeutic settings.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Priors in the Maximum Entropy on the Mean Method for Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for implementing the maximumn entropy on the mean (MEM) method for linear inverse problems in the setting of approximate (data-driven) priors. We prove a.s. convergence for empirical means and further develop general estimates for the difference between the MEM solutions with different priors $\mu$ and $\nu$ based upon the epigraphical distance between their respective log-moment generating functions. These estimates allow us to establish a rate of convergence in expectation for empirical means. We illustrate our results with denoising on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets.</description>

      <title>Causal Composition Diffusion Model for Closed-loop Traffic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation is critical for safety evaluation in autonomous driving, particularly in capturing complex interactive behaviors. However, generating realistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a significant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting objective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which is amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal Compositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework to address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable and realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem. Then, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by automatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the diffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and controllability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a closed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred trajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and leveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on key metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.</description>

      <title>Study of the Proper NNUE Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks) has revolutionized chess engine development, with nearly all top engines adopting NNUE models to maintain competitive performance. A key challenge in NNUE training is the creation of high-quality datasets, particularly in complex domains like chess, where tactical and strategic evaluations are essential. However, methods for constructing effective datasets remain poorly understood and under-documented. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for generating and filtering datasets composed of "quiet" positions that are stable and free from tactical volatility. Our approach provides a clear methodology for dataset creation, which can be replicated and generalized across various evaluation functions. Testing demonstrates significant improvements in engine performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>ArchComplete: Autoregressive 3D Architectural Design Generation with Hierarchical Diffusion-Based Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textit{ArchComplete}$ is a two-stage dense voxel-based 3D generative pipeline developed to tackle the high complexity in architectural geometries and topologies, assisting with ideation and geometric detailisation in the early design process. In stage 1, a $\textit{3D Voxel VQGAN}$ model is devised, whose composition is then modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse models. Subsequently, in stage 2, $\textit{Hierarchical Voxel Upsampling Networks}$ consisting of a set of 3D conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models are defined to augment the coarse shapes with fine geometric details. The first stage is trained on a dataset of house models with fully modelled exteriors and interiors with a novel 2.5D perceptual loss to capture input complexities across multiple abstraction levels, while the second stage trains on randomly cropped local volumetric patches, requiring significantly less compute and memory. For inference, the pipeline first autoregressively generates house models at a resolution of $64^3$ and then progressively refines them to resolution of $256^3$ with voxel sizes as small as $18\text{cm}$. ArchComplete supports a range of interaction modes solving a variety of tasks, including interpolation, variation generation, unconditional synthesis, and two conditional synthesis tasks: shape completion and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation. The results demonstrate notable improvements against state-of-the-art on established metrics.</description>

      <title>tuGEMM: Area-Power-Efficient Temporal Unary GEMM Architecture for Low-Precision Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a ubiquitous computing kernel/algorithm for data processing in diverse applications, including artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Recent shift towards edge computing has inspired GEMM architectures based on unary computing, which are predominantly stochastic and rate-coded systems. This paper proposes a novel GEMM architecture based on temporal-coding, called tuGEMM, that performs exact computation. We introduce two variants of tuGEMM, serial and parallel, with distinct area/power-latency trade-offs. Post-synthesis Power-Performance-Area (PPA) in 45 nm CMOS are reported for 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit computations. The designs illustrate significant advantages in area-power efficiency over state-of-the-art stochastic unary systems especially at low precisions, e.g. incurring just 0.03 mm^2 and 9 mW for 4 bits, and 0.01 mm^2 and 4 mW for 2 bits. This makes tuGEMM ideal for power constrained mobile and edge devices performing always-on real-time sensory processing.</description>

      <title>CARL-GT: Evaluating Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal reasoning capabilities are essential for large language models (LLMs) in a wide range of applications, such as education and healthcare. But there is still a lack of benchmarks for a better understanding of such capabilities. Current LLM benchmarks are mainly based on conversational tasks, academic math tests, and coding tests. Such benchmarks evaluate LLMs in well-regularized settings, but they are limited in assessing the skills and abilities to solve real-world problems. In this work, we provide a benchmark, named by CARL-GT, which evaluates CAusal Reasoning capabilities of large Language models using Graphs and Tabular data. The benchmark has a diverse range of tasks for evaluating LLMs from causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making aspects. In addition, effective zero-shot learning prompts are developed for the tasks. In our experiments, we leverage the benchmark for evaluating open-source LLMs and provide a detailed comparison of LLMs for causal reasoning abilities. We found that LLMs are still weak in casual reasoning, especially with tabular data to discover new insights. Furthermore, we investigate and discuss the relationships of different benchmark tasks by analyzing the performance of LLMs. The experimental results show that LLMs have different strength over different tasks and that their performance on tasks in different categories, i.e., causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making, shows stronger correlation than tasks in the same category.</description>

      <title>Improving Sickle Cell Disease Classification: A Fusion of Conventional Classifiers, Segmented Images, and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sickle cell anemia, which is characterized by abnormal erythrocyte morphology, can be detected using microscopic images. Computational techniques in medicine enhance the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. However, many computational techniques, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), require high resources and time for training, highlighting the research opportunities in methods with low computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining conventional classifiers, segmented images, and CNNs for the automated classification of sickle cell disease. We evaluated the impact of segmented images on classification, providing insight into deep learning integration. Our results demonstrate that using segmented images and CNN features with an SVM achieves an accuracy of 96.80%. This finding is relevant for computationally efficient scenarios, paving the way for future research and advancements in medical-image analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Path Finding in Continuous Spaces with Projected Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents moving from their respective start to goal positions. Coordinating multiple agents in a shared environment poses significant challenges, especially in continuous spaces where traditional optimization algorithms struggle with scalability. Moreover, these algorithms often depend on discretized representations of the environment, which can be impractical in image-based or high-dimensional settings. Recently, diffusion models have shown promise in single-agent path planning, capturing complex trajectory distributions and generating smooth paths that navigate continuous, high-dimensional spaces. However, directly extending diffusion models to MAPF introduces new challenges since these models struggle to ensure constraint feasibility, such as inter-agent collision avoidance. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel approach that integrates constrained optimization with diffusion models for MAPF in continuous spaces. This unique combination directly produces feasible multi-agent trajectories that respect collision avoidance and kinematic constraints. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated across various challenging simulated scenarios of varying dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Shifted Composition III: Local Error Framework for KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling arguments are a central tool for bounding the deviation between two stochastic processes, but traditionally have been limited to Wasserstein metrics. In this paper, we apply the shifted composition rule--an information-theoretic principle introduced in our earlier work--in order to adapt coupling arguments to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our framework combine the strengths of two previously disparate approaches: local error analysis and Girsanov's theorem. Akin to the former, it yields tight bounds by incorporating the so-called weak error, and is user-friendly in that it only requires easily verified local assumptions; and akin to the latter, it yields KL divergence guarantees and applies beyond Wasserstein contractivity.
  We apply this framework to the problem of sampling from a target distribution $\pi$. Here, the two stochastic processes are the Langevin diffusion and an algorithmic discretization thereof. Our framework provides a unified analysis when $\pi$ is assumed to be strongly log-concave (SLC), weakly log-concave (WLC), or to satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality (LSI). Among other results, this yields KL guarantees for the randomized midpoint discretization of the Langevin diffusion. Notably, our result: (1) yields the optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt d/\epsilon)$ rate in the SLC and LSI settings; (2) is the first result to hold beyond the 2-Wasserstein metric in the SLC setting; and (3) is the first result to hold in \emph{any} metric in the WLC and LSI settings.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Regularity for Relatively Perfect Discrete Morse Gradient Vector Fields of ReLU Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One common function class in machine learning is the class of ReLU neural networks. ReLU neural networks induce a piecewise linear decomposition of their input space called the canonical polyhedral complex. It has previously been established that it is decidable whether a ReLU neural network is piecewise linear Morse. In order to expand computational tools for analyzing the topological properties of ReLU neural networks, and to harness the strengths of discrete Morse theory, we introduce a schematic for translating between a given piecewise linear Morse function (e.g. parameters of a ReLU neural network) on a canonical polyhedral complex and a compatible (``relatively perfect") discrete Morse function on the same complex. Our approach is constructive, producing an algorithm that can be used to determine if a given vertex in a canonical polyhedral complex corresponds to a piecewise linear Morse critical point. Furthermore we provide an algorithm for constructing a consistent discrete Morse pairing on cells in the canonical polyhedral complex which contain this vertex. We additionally provide some new realizability results with respect to sublevel set topology in the case of shallow ReLU neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years generative artificial intelligence has been used to create data to support science analysis. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been trained using Monte Carlo simulated input and then used to generate data for the same problem. This has the advantage that a GAN creates data in a significantly reduced computing time. N training events for a GAN can result in GN generated events with the gain factor, G, being more than one. This appears to violate the principle that one cannot get information for free. This is not the only way to amplify data so this process will be referred to as data amplification which is studied using information theoretic concepts. It is shown that a gain of greater than one is possible whilst keeping the information content of the data unchanged. This leads to a mathematical bound which only depends on the number of generated and training events. This study determines conditions on both the underlying and reconstructed probability distributions to ensure this bound. In particular, the resolution of variables in amplified data is not improved by the process but the increase in sample size can still improve statistical significance. The bound is confirmed using computer simulation and analysis of GAN generated data from the literature.</description>

      <title>Emoji Retrieval from Gibberish or Garbled Social Media Text: A Novel Methodology and A Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emojis are widely used across social media platforms but are often lost in noisy or garbled text, posing challenges for data analysis and machine learning. Conventional preprocessing approaches recommend removing such text, risking the loss of emojis and their contextual meaning. This paper proposes a three-step reverse-engineering methodology to retrieve emojis from garbled text in social media posts. The methodology also identifies reasons for the generation of such text during social media data mining. To evaluate its effectiveness, the approach was applied to 509,248 Tweets about the Mpox outbreak, a dataset referenced in about 30 prior works that failed to retrieve emojis from garbled text. Our method retrieved 157,748 emojis from 76,914 Tweets. Improvements in text readability and coherence were demonstrated through metrics such as Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, Dale-Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time. Additionally, the frequency of individual emojis and their patterns of usage in these Tweets were analyzed, and the results are presented.</description>

      <title>Fair Knowledge Tracing in Second Language Acquisition</title>

Abstract: In second-language acquisition, predictive modeling aids educators in implementing diverse teaching strategies, attracting significant research attention. However, while model accuracy is widely explored, model fairness remains under-examined. Model fairness ensures equitable treatment of groups, preventing unintentional biases based on attributes such as gender, ethnicity, or economic background. A fair model should produce impartial outcomes that do not systematically disadvantage any group.
  This study evaluates the fairness of two predictive models using the Duolingo dataset's en\_es (English learners speaking Spanish), es\_en (Spanish learners speaking English), and fr\_en (French learners speaking English) tracks. We analyze: 1. Algorithmic fairness across platforms (iOS, Android, Web). 2. Algorithmic fairness between developed and developing countries.
  Key findings include: 1. Deep learning outperforms machine learning in second-language knowledge tracing due to improved accuracy and fairness. 2. Both models favor mobile users over non-mobile users. 3. Machine learning exhibits stronger bias against developing countries compared to deep learning. 4. Deep learning strikes a better balance of fairness and accuracy in the en\_es and es\_en tracks, while machine learning is more suitable for fr\_en.
  This study highlights the importance of addressing fairness in predictive models to ensure equitable educational strategies across platforms and regions.</description>

      <title>MMFactory: A Universal Solution Search Engine for Vision-Language Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in foundational and vision-language models, and effective fine-tuning techniques, a large number of both general and special-purpose models have been developed for a variety of visual tasks. Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

      <title>Heterogeneous transfer learning for high dimensional regression with feature mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of transferring knowledge from a source, or proxy, domain to a new target domain for learning a high-dimensional regression model with possibly different features. Recently, the statistical properties of homogeneous transfer learning have been investigated. However, most homogeneous transfer and multi-task learning methods assume that the target and proxy domains have the same feature space, limiting their practical applicability. In applications, target and proxy feature spaces are frequently inherently different, for example, due to the inability to measure some variables in the target data-poor environments. Conversely, existing heterogeneous transfer learning methods do not provide statistical error guarantees, limiting their utility for scientific discovery. We propose a two-stage method that involves learning the relationship between the missing and observed features through a projection step in the proxy data and then solving a joint penalized regression optimization problem in the target data. We develop an upper bound on the method's parameter estimation risk and prediction risk, assuming that the proxy and the target domain parameters are sparsely different. Our results elucidate how estimation and prediction error depend on the complexity of the model, sample size, the extent of overlap, and correlation between matched and mismatched features.</description>

      <title>Generating Traffic Scenarios via In-Context Learning to Learn Better Motion Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model (LLM) translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

      <title>BRIDGE: Bundle Recommendation via Instruction-Driven Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to suggest a set of interconnected items to users. However, diverse interaction types and sparse interaction matrices often pose challenges for previous approaches in accurately predicting user-bundle adoptions. Inspired by the distant supervision strategy and generative paradigm, we propose BRIDGE, a novel framework for bundle recommendation. It consists of two main components namely the correlation-based item clustering and the pseudo bundle generation modules. Inspired by the distant supervision approach, the former is to generate more auxiliary information, e.g., instructive item clusters, for training without using external data. This information is subsequently aggregated with collaborative signals from user historical interactions to create pseudo `ideal' bundles. This capability allows BRIDGE to explore all aspects of bundles, rather than being limited to existing real-world bundles. It effectively bridging the gap between user imagination and predefined bundles, hence improving the bundle recommendation performance. Experimental results validate the superiority of our models over state-of-the-art ranking-based methods across five benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Age Optimal Sampling for Unreliable Channels under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system in which a sensor forwards status updates to a receiver through an error-prone channel, while the receiver sends the transmission results back to the sensor via a reliable channel. Both channels are subject to random delays. To evaluate the timeliness of the status information at the receiver, we use the Age of Information (AoI) metric. The objective is to design a sampling policy that minimizes the expected time-average AoI, even when the channel statistics (e.g., delay distributions) are unknown. We first review the threshold structure of the optimal offline policy under known channel statistics and then reformulate the design of the online algorithm as a stochastic approximation problem. We propose a Robbins-Monro algorithm to solve this problem and demonstrate that the optimal threshold can be approximated almost surely. Moreover, we prove that the cumulative AoI regret of the online algorithm increases with rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln K)$, where $K$ is the number of successful transmissions. In addition, our algorithm is shown to be minimax order optimal, in the sense that for any online learning algorithm, the cumulative AoI regret up to the $K$-th successful transmissions grows with the rate at least $\Omega(\ln K)$ in the worst case delay distribution. Finally, we improve the stability of the proposed online learning algorithm through a momentum-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits in the Search for Less Discriminatory Algorithms -- and How to Avoid Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disparate impact doctrine offers an important legal apparatus for targeting unfair data-driven algorithmic decisions. A recent body of work has focused on conceptualizing and operationalizing one particular construct from this doctrine -- the less discriminatory alternative, an alternative policy that reduces disparities while meeting the same business needs of a status quo or baseline policy. This paper puts forward four fundamental results, which each represent limits to searching for and using less discriminatory algorithms (LDAs). (1) Statistically, although LDAs are almost always identifiable in retrospect on fixed populations, making conclusions about how alternative classifiers perform on an unobserved distribution is more difficult. (2) Mathematically, a classifier can only exhibit certain combinations of accuracy and selection rate disparity between groups, given the size of each group and the base rate of the property or outcome of interest in each group. (3) Computationally, a search for a lower-disparity classifier at some baseline level of utility is NP-hard. (4) From a modeling and consumer welfare perspective, defining an LDA only in terms of business needs can lead to LDAs that leave consumers strictly worse off, including members of the disadvantaged group. These findings, which may seem on their face to give firms strong defenses against discrimination claims, only tell part of the story. For each of our negative results limiting what is attainable in this setting, we offer positive results demonstrating that there exist effective and low-cost strategies that are remarkably effective at identifying viable lower-disparity policies.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Value for Data Production and its Application to Data Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How much value does a dataset or a data production process have to an agent who wishes to use the data to assist decision-making? This is a fundamental question towards understanding the value of data as well as further pricing of data. This paper develops an approach for capturing the instrumental value of data production processes, which takes two key factors into account: (a) the context of the agent's decision-making problem; (b) prior data or information the agent already possesses. We ''micro-found'' our valuation concepts by showing how they connect to classic notions of information design and signals in information economics. When instantiated in the domain of Bayesian linear regression, our value naturally corresponds to information gain. Based on our designed data value, we then study a basic monopoly pricing setting with a buyer looking to purchase from a seller some labeled data of a certain feature direction in order to improve a Bayesian regression model. We show that when the seller has the ability to fully customize any data request, she can extract the first-best revenue (i.e., full surplus) from any population of buyers, i.e., achieving first-degree price discrimination. If the seller can only sell data that are derived from an existing data pool, this limits her ability to customize, and achieving first-best revenue becomes generally impossible. However, we design a mechanism that achieves seller revenue at most $\log (\kappa)$ less than the first-best revenue, where $\kappa$ is the condition number associated with the data matrix. A corollary of this result is that the seller can extract the first-best revenue in the multi-armed bandits special case.</description>

      <title>PCM Selector: Penalized Covariate-Mediator Selection Operator for Evaluating Linear Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a data-generating process for random variables that can be described with a linear structural equation model, we consider a situation in which (i) a set of covariates satisfying the back-door criterion cannot be observed or (ii) such a set can be observed, but standard statistical estimation methods cannot be applied to estimate causal effects because of multicollinearity/high-dimensional data problems. We propose a novel two-stage penalized regression approach, the penalized covariate-mediator selection operator (PCM Selector), to estimate the causal effects in such scenarios. Unlike existing penalized regression analyses, when a set of intermediate variables is available, PCM Selector provides a consistent or less biased estimator of the causal effect. In addition, PCM Selector provides a variable selection procedure for intermediate variables to obtain better estimation accuracy of the causal effects than does the back-door criterion.</description>

      <title>Robustness-aware Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is based on the quality of the prompts and the semantic and structural integrity information of the input data. However, current prompt generation methods primarily focus on generating prompts for clean input data, often overlooking the impact of perturbed inputs on prompt performance. To address this limitation, we propose BATprompt (By Adversarial Training prompt), a novel method for prompt generation designed to withstand input perturbations (such as typos in the input). Inspired by adversarial training techniques, BATprompt demonstrates strong performance on a variety of perturbed tasks through a two-step process: adversarial perturbation and iterative optimization on unperturbed input via LLM. Unlike conventional adversarial attack methods, BATprompt avoids reliance on real gradients or model parameters. Instead, it leverages the advanced reasoning, language understanding and self reflection capabilities of LLMs to simulate gradients, guiding the generation of adversarial perturbations and optimizing prompt performance. In our experiments, we evaluate BATprompt on multiple datasets across both language understanding and generation tasks. The results indicate that BATprompt outperforms existing prompt generation methods, delivering superior robustness and performance under diverse perturbation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Deep Learning with Multi-Head Attention for Accurate Extraction of Medicine from Handwritten Prescriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting medication names from handwritten doctor prescriptions is challenging due to the wide variability in handwriting styles and prescription formats. This paper presents a robust method for extracting medicine names using a combination of Mask R-CNN and Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (TrOCR) with Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings. A novel dataset, featuring diverse handwritten prescriptions from various regions of Pakistan, was utilized to fine-tune the model on different handwriting styles. The Mask R-CNN model segments the prescription images to focus on the medicinal sections, while the TrOCR model, enhanced by Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings, transcribes the isolated text. The transcribed text is then matched against a pre-existing database for accurate identification. The proposed approach achieved a character error rate (CER) of 1.4% on standard benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for automating medicine name extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quantum framework for addressing reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, grounded in the quantum principles and leveraging a fully quantum model of the classical Markov Decision Process (MDP). By employing quantum concepts and a quantum search algorithm, this work presents the implementation and optimization of the agent-environment interactions entirely within the quantum domain, eliminating reliance on classical computations. Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum advantage in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks. This work not only underscores the applicability of quantum computing in machine learning but also contributes the field of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) by offering a robust framework for understanding and exploiting quantum computing in RL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topic of speech separation involves separating mixed speech with multiple overlapping speakers into several streams, with each stream containing speech from only one speaker. Many highly effective models have emerged and proliferated rapidly over time. However, the size and computational load of these models have also increased accordingly. This is a disaster for the community, as researchers need more time and computational resources to reproduce and compare existing models. In this paper, we propose U-mamba-net: a lightweight Mamba-based U-style model for speech separation in complex environments. Mamba is a state space sequence model that incorporates feature selection capabilities. U-style network is a fully convolutional neural network whose symmetric contracting and expansive paths are able to learn multi-resolution features. In our work, Mamba serves as a feature filter, alternating with U-Net. We test the proposed model on Libri2mix. The results show that U-Mamba-Net achieves improved performance with quite low computational cost.</description>

      <title>GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

      <title>Leveraging Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer Synergy for Predictive Modeling in Risk-Based Applications</title>

Abstract: With the development of the financial industry, credit default prediction, as an important task in financial risk management, has received increasing attention. Traditional credit default prediction methods mostly rely on machine learning models, such as decision trees and random forests, but these methods have certain limitations in processing complex data and capturing potential risk patterns. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning model based on the combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer for credit user default prediction. The model combines the advantages of CNN in local feature extraction with the ability of Transformer in global dependency modeling, effectively improving the accuracy and robustness of credit default prediction. Through experiments on public credit default datasets, the results show that the CNN+Transformer model outperforms traditional machine learning models, such as random forests and XGBoost, in multiple evaluation indicators such as accuracy, AUC, and KS value, demonstrating its powerful ability in complex financial data modeling. Further experimental analysis shows that appropriate optimizer selection and learning rate adjustment play a vital role in improving model performance. In addition, the ablation experiment of the model verifies the advantages of the combination of CNN and Transformer and proves the complementarity of the two in credit default prediction. This study provides a new idea for credit default prediction and provides strong support for risk assessment and intelligent decision-making in the financial field. Future research can further improve the prediction effect and generalization ability by introducing more unstructured data and improving the model architecture.</description>

      <title>OMG-HD: A High-Resolution AI Weather Model for End-to-End Forecasts from Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence Weather Prediction (AIWP) models have achieved performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models by leveraging reanalysis data. However, a less-explored approach involves training AIWP models directly on observational data, enhancing computational efficiency and improving forecast accuracy by reducing the uncertainties introduced through data assimilation processes. In this study, we propose OMG-HD, a novel AI-based regional high-resolution weather forecasting model designed to make predictions directly from observational data sources, including surface stations, radar, and satellite, thereby removing the need for operational data assimilation. Our evaluation shows that OMG-HD outperforms both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)'s high-resolution operational forecasting system, IFS-HRES, and the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model at lead times of up to 12 hours across the contiguous United States (CONUS) region. We achieve up to a 13% improvement on RMSE for 2-meter temperature, 17% on 10-meter wind speed, 48% on 2-meter specific humidity, and 32% on surface pressure compared to HRRR. Our method shows that it is possible to use AI-driven approaches for rapid weather predictions without relying on NWP-derived weather fields as model input. This is a promising step towards using observational data directly to make operational forecasts with AIWP models.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet regression for multi-label feature selection with implicit regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet regression extends linear regression to model complex responses
  in metric spaces, making it particularly relevant for multi-label regression,
  where each instance can have multiple associated labels. However, variable
  selection within this framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we pro pose a novel variable selection method that employs implicit regularization
  instead of traditional explicit regularization approaches, which can introduce
  bias. Our method effectively captures nonlinear interactions between predic tors and responses while promoting model sparsity. We provide theoretical
  results demonstrating selection consistency and illustrate the performance of
  our approach through numerical examples</description>

      <title>Towards Modality Generalization: A Benchmark and Prospective Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers significant advantages in spectral and energy efficiencies, positioning it as a cornerstone technology of fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication systems and a promising solution for the burgeoning data demands anticipated in sixth-generation (6G) networks. In recent years, with the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), a multitude of task-oriented generative foundation models (GFMs) have emerged, achieving remarkable performance in various fields such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and autonomous driving. As a pioneering force, these models are driving the paradigm shift in AI towards generative AI (GenAI). Among them, the generative diffusion model (GDM), as one of state-of-the-art families of generative models, demonstrates an exceptional capability to learn implicit prior knowledge and robust generalization capabilities, thereby enhancing its versatility and effectiveness across diverse applications. In this paper, we delve into the potential applications of GDM in massive MIMO communications. Specifically, we first provide an overview of massive MIMO communication, the framework of GFMs, and the working mechanism of GDM. Following this, we discuss recent research advancements in the field and present a case study of near-field channel estimation based on GDM, demonstrating its promising potential for facilitating efficient ultra-dimensional channel statement information (CSI) acquisition in the context of massive MIMO communications. Finally, we highlight several pressing challenges in future mobile communications and identify promising research directions surrounding GDM.</description>

      <title>Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</description>

      <title>DeepCRCEval: Revisiting the Evaluation of Code Review Comment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code review is a vital but demanding aspect of software development, generating significant interest in automating review comments. Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.
  This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.
  Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively. Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Against Unknown Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a learning agent who has to repeatedly play a general sum game against a strategic opponent who acts to maximize their own payoff by optimally responding against the learner's algorithm. The learning agent knows their own payoff function, but is uncertain about the payoff of their opponent (knowing only that it is drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$). What learning algorithm should the agent run in order to maximize their own total utility?
  We demonstrate how to construct an $\varepsilon$-optimal learning algorithm (obtaining average utility within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal utility) for this problem in time polynomial in the size of the input and $1/\varepsilon$ when either the size of the game or the support of $\mathcal{D}$ is constant. When the learning algorithm is further constrained to be a no-regret algorithm, we demonstrate how to efficiently construct an optimal learning algorithm (asymptotically achieving the optimal utility) in polynomial time, independent of any other assumptions. Both results make use of recently developed machinery that converts the analysis of learning algorithms to the study of the class of corresponding geometric objects known as menus.</description>

      <title>Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>FameBias: Embedding Manipulation Bias Attack in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images that align closely with textual descriptions. However, this progress has also raised concerns about their misuse for propaganda and other malicious activities. Recent studies reveal that attackers can embed biases into these models through simple fine-tuning, causing them to generate targeted imagery when triggered by specific phrases. This underscores the potential for T2I models to act as tools for disseminating propaganda, producing images aligned with an attacker's objective for end-users.
  Building on this concept, we introduce FameBias, a T2I biasing attack that manipulates the embeddings of input prompts to generate images featuring specific public figures. Unlike prior methods, Famebias operates solely on the input embedding vectors without requiring additional model training. We evaluate FameBias comprehensively using Stable Diffusion V2, generating a large corpus of images based on various trigger nouns and target public figures. Our experiments demonstrate that FameBias achieves a high attack success rate while preserving the semantic context of the original prompts across multiple trigger-target pairs.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Label Noise using Prompt-Based Hyperbolic Meta-Learning in Open-Set Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) is a challenging task requiring models to accurately predict familiar categories while minimizing confidence for unknown categories to effectively reject them in unseen domains. While the OSDG field has seen considerable advancements, the impact of label noise--a common issue in real-world datasets--has been largely overlooked. Label noise can mislead model optimization, thereby exacerbating the challenges of open-set recognition in novel domains. In this study, we take the first step towards addressing Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) by constructing dedicated benchmarks derived from widely used OSDG datasets, including PACS and DigitsDG. We evaluate baseline approaches by integrating techniques from both label denoising and OSDG methodologies, highlighting the limitations of existing strategies in handling label noise effectively. To address these limitations, we propose HyProMeta, a novel framework that integrates hyperbolic category prototypes for label noise-aware meta-learning alongside a learnable new-category agnostic prompt designed to enhance generalization to unseen classes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HyProMeta compared to state-of-the-art methods across the newly established benchmarks. The source code of this work is released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HyProMeta.</description>

      <title>Predator Prey Scavenger Model using Holling's Functional Response of Type III and Physics-Informed Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear mathematical models introduce the relation between various physical and biological interactions present in nature. One of the most famous models is the Lotka-Volterra model which defined the interaction between predator and prey species present in nature. However, predators, scavengers, and prey populations coexist in a natural system where scavengers can additionally rely on the dead bodies of predators present in the system. Keeping this in mind, the formulation and simulation of the predator prey scavenger model is introduced in this paper. For the predation response, respective prey species are assumed to have Holling's functional response of type III. The proposed model is tested for various simulations and is found to be showing satisfactory results in different scenarios. After simulations, the American forest dataset is taken for parameter estimation which imitates the real-world case. For parameter estimation, a physics-informed deep neural network is used with the Adam backpropagation method which prevents the avalanche effect in trainable parameters updation. For neural networks, mean square error and physics-informed informed error are considered. After the neural network, the hence-found parameters are fine-tuned using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Finally, the hence-found parameters using a natural dataset are tested for stability using Jacobian stability analysis. Future research work includes minimization of error induced by parameters, bifurcation analysis, and sensitivity analysis of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Addressing Spatial-Temporal Data Heterogeneity in Federated Continual Learning via Tail Anchor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</description>

Abstract: The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>Weak Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Observation from Large Vision Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling capability has been widely validated with respect to the number of parameters and the size of training data. One important question that is unexplored is that does scaling capability also exists similarly with respect to the number of vision tokens? This study fills the gap by investigating the relationship between the number of vision tokens and the performance of vision-language models. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations reveal that the model exhibits weak scaling capabilities on the length \(N_l\), with performance approximately \(S(N_l) \approx (c/N_l)^{\alpha}\), where \(c, \alpha\) are hyperparameters. Interestingly, this scaling behavior remains largely unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the user's question in the input. Furthermore, fusing the user's question with the vision token can enhance model performance when the question is relevant to the task. To address the computational challenges associated with large-scale vision tokens, we propose a novel architecture that efficiently reduces the token count while integrating user question tokens into the representation. Our findings may offer insights for developing more efficient and effective vision-language models under specific task constraints.</description>

      <title>RDPM: Solve Diffusion Probabilistic Models via Recurrent Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</description>

      <title>Extract Free Dense Misalignment from CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models still frequently produce outputs misaligned with their inputs, evidenced by object hallucination in captioning and prompt misalignment in the text-to-image generation model. Recent studies have explored methods for identifying misaligned elements, aiming not only to enhance interpretability but also to improve model performance. However, current approaches primarily rely on large foundation models in a zero-shot manner or fine-tuned models with human annotations, which limits scalability due to significant computational costs. This work proposes a novel approach, dubbed CLIP4DM, for detecting dense misalignments from pre-trained CLIP, specifically focusing on pinpointing misaligned words between image and text. We carefully revamp the gradient-based attribution computation method, enabling negative gradient of individual text tokens to indicate misalignment. We also propose F-CLIPScore, which aggregates misaligned attributions with a global alignment score. We evaluate our method on various dense misalignment detection benchmarks, covering various image and text domains and misalignment types. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot models and competitive performance with fine-tuned models while maintaining superior efficiency. Our qualitative examples show that our method has a unique strength to detect entity-level objects, intangible objects, and attributes that can not be easily detected for existing works. We conduct ablation studies and analyses to highlight the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/CLIP4DM.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Ranking LLM-Based Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 2D Materials via Symmetry-Constrained Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in accelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of these materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However, existing generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints, which limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here, we introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates space group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff positions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the generation of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to evaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural relaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy stability criteria (Ehull &lt; 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six candidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band structure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which exhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a symmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure prediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints enhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to the discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Offensive Potential of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laymen -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</description>

      <title>VORTEX: A Spatial Computing Framework for Optimized Drone Telemetry Extraction from First-Person View Flight Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.</description>

      <title>Subsampling, aligning, and averaging to find circular coordinates in recurrent time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for finding robust circular coordinates on data that is expected to exhibit recurrence, such as that which appears in neuronal recordings of C. elegans. Techniques exist to create circular coordinates on a simplicial complex from a dimension 1 cohomology class, and these can be applied to the Rips complex of a dataset when it has a prominent class in its dimension 1 cohomology. However, it is known this approach is extremely sensitive to uneven sampling density.
  Our algorithm comes with a new method to correct for uneven sampling density, adapting our prior work on averaging coordinates in manifold learning. We use rejection sampling to correct for inhomogeneous sampling and then apply Procrustes matching to align and average the subsamples. In addition to providing a more robust coordinate than other approaches, this subsampling and averaging approach has better efficiency.
  We validate our technique on both synthetic data sets and neuronal activity recordings. Our results reveal a topological model of neuronal trajectories for C. elegans that is constructed from loops in which different regions of the brain state space can be mapped to specific and interpretable macroscopic behaviors in the worm.</description>

Abstract: Process control and optimization have been widely used to solve decision-making problems in chemical engineering applications. However, identifying and tuning the best solution algorithm is challenging and time-consuming. Machine learning tools can be used to automate these steps by learning the behavior of a numerical solver from data. In this paper, we discuss recent advances in (i) the representation of decision-making problems for machine learning tasks, (ii) algorithm selection, and (iii) algorithm configuration for monolithic and decomposition-based algorithms. Finally, we discuss open problems related to the application of machine learning for accelerating process optimization and control.</description>

      <title>GCN-ABFT: Low-Cost Online Error Checking for Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are popular for building machine-learning application for graph-structured data. This widespread adoption led to the development of specialized GCN hardware accelerators. In this work, we address a key architectural challenge for GCN accelerators: how to detect errors in GCN computations arising from random hardware faults with the least computation cost. Each GCN layer performs a graph convolution, mathematically equivalent to multiplying three matrices, computed through two separate matrix multiplications. Existing Algorithm-based Fault Tolerance(ABFT) techniques can check the results of individual matrix multiplications. However, for a GCN layer, this check should be performed twice. To avoid this overhead, this work introduces GCN-ABFT that directly calculates a checksum for the entire three-matrix product within a single GCN layer, providing a cost-effective approach for error detection in GCN accelerators. Experimental results demonstrate that GCN-ABFT reduces the number of operations needed for checksum computation by over 21% on average for representative GCN applications. These savings are achieved without sacrificing fault-detection accuracy, as evidenced by the presented fault-injection analysis.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in statistical learning theory have revealed profound connections between mutual information (MI) bounds, PAC-Bayesian theory, and Bayesian nonparametrics. This work introduces a novel mutual information bound for statistical models. The derived bound has wide-ranging applications in statistical inference. It yields improved contraction rates for fractional posteriors in Bayesian nonparametrics. It can also be used to study a wide range of estimation methods, such as variational inference or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). By bridging these diverse areas, this work advances our understanding of the fundamental limits of statistical inference and the role of information in learning from data. We hope that these results will not only clarify connections between statistical inference and information theory but also help to develop a new toolbox to study a wide range of estimators.</description>

      <title>Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

      <title>HNCI: High-Dimensional Network Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment or policy commonly appears in causal inference applications under network interference. In this paper, we suggest the new method of high-dimensional network causal inference (HNCI) that provides both valid confidence interval on the average direct treatment effect on the treated (ADET) and valid confidence set for the neighborhood size for interference effect. We exploit the model setting in Belloni et al. (2022) and allow certain type of heterogeneity in node interference neighborhood sizes. We propose a linear regression formulation of potential outcomes, where the regression coefficients correspond to the underlying true interference function values of nodes and exhibit a latent homogeneous structure. Such a formulation allows us to leverage existing literature from linear regression and homogeneity pursuit to conduct valid statistical inferences with theoretical guarantees. The resulting confidence intervals for the ADET are formally justified through asymptotic normalities with estimable variances. We further provide the confidence set for the neighborhood size with theoretical guarantees exploiting the repro samples approach. The practical utilities of the newly suggested methods are demonstrated through simulation and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Dynamic Qubit Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard combinatorial optimization problems, often mapped to Ising models, promise potential solutions with quantum advantage but are constrained by limited qubit counts in near-term devices. We present an innovative quantum-inspired framework that dynamically compresses large Ising models to fit available quantum hardware of different sizes. Thus, we aim to bridge the gap between large-scale optimization and current hardware capabilities. Our method leverages a physics-inspired GNN architecture to capture complex interactions in Ising models and accurately predict alignments among neighboring spins (aka qubits) at ground states. By progressively merging such aligned spins, we can reduce the model size while preserving the underlying optimization structure. It also provides a natural trade-off between the solution quality and size reduction, meeting different hardware constraints of quantum computing devices. Extensive numerical studies on Ising instances of diverse topologies show that our method can reduce instance size at multiple levels with virtually no losses in solution quality on the latest D-wave quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>ReducedLUT: Table Decomposition with "Don't Care" Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lookup tables (LUTs) are frequently used to efficiently store arrays of precomputed values for complex mathematical computations. When used in the context of neural networks, these functions exhibit a lack of recognizable patterns which presents an unusual challenge for conventional logic synthesis techniques. Several approaches are known to break down a single large lookup table into multiple smaller ones that can be recombined. Traditional methods, such as plain tabulation, piecewise linear approximation, and multipartite table methods, often yield inefficient hardware solutions when applied to LUT-based NNs.
  This paper introduces ReducedLUT, a novel method to reduce the footprint of the LUTs by injecting don't cares into the compression process. This additional freedom introduces more self-similarities which can be exploited using known decomposition techniques. We then demonstrate a particular application to machine learning; by replacing unobserved patterns within the training data of neural network models with don't cares, we enable greater compression with minimal model accuracy degradation. In practice, we achieve up to $1.63\times$ reduction in Physical LUT utilization, with a test accuracy drop of no more than $0.01$ accuracy points.</description>

      <title>Exploring Embedding Priors in Prompt-Tuning for Improved Interpretability and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt-Tuning is an efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks with minimal computational overhead by modifying prompt embeddings. In this work, we investigate how crucial the phenomenon of embedding collapse, frequently observed in Prompt-Tuning, is for the final performance of the model. To address this question, we designed embedding priors and compared them with posteriors of the converged Soft and Deep Prompt-Tuning methods. Our findings suggest that priors strongly affect the position of the tuned embeddings, and models can effectively work with embeddings from different parts of activation spaces, including completely new regions. As the final Prompt-Tuning capabilities are limited, we hypothesize that controllable Prompt-Tuning posteriors may serve as a good starting point for tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT) distillation. Our experiments also show that generated trajectories are not localized in the activation space of the models. However, there are distinct clusters of activations for distant tasks (e.g., NLP and arithmetic), while activations between NLP tasks (e.g., Question-Answering and MLM) lie in the same cluster. These observations raise questions about the importance of a single activation cluster for the generalization abilities of large language models.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Robust 3D MRI Reconstruction with 2D Diffusion Priors: Diverse-Resolution Training Outperforms Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based 3D imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is challenging because of limited availability of 3D training data. Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction. However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors. As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices. This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI. In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence in GameFi: Embodied AI Agents and the Convergence of DeFi and Virtual Ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Trust Intervals for Out of Distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of a deep learning network to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems. Existing OOD detection methods often involve complex architectural innovations, such as ensemble models, which, while enhancing detection accuracy, significantly increase model complexity and training time. Other methods utilize surrogate samples to simulate OOD inputs, but these may not generalize well across different types of OOD data. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet novel technique to enhance OOD detection in pre-trained networks without altering its original parameters. Our approach defines probabilistic trust intervals for each network weight, determined using in-distribution data. During inference, additional weight values are sampled, and the resulting disagreements among outputs are utilized for OOD detection. We propose a metric to quantify this disagreement and validate its effectiveness with empirical evidence. Our method significantly outperforms various baseline methods across multiple OOD datasets without requiring actual or surrogate OOD samples. We evaluate our approach on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10-C (a corruption-augmented version of CIFAR-10), across various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-20, DenseNet-100). On the MNIST-FashionMNIST setup, our method achieves a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 12.46\% at 95\% True Positive Rate (TPR), compared to 27.09\% achieved by the best baseline. On adversarial and corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-10-C, our proposed method easily differentiate between clean and noisy inputs. These results demonstrate the robustness of our approach in identifying corrupted and adversarial inputs, all without requiring OOD samples during training.</description>

Abstract: Temporal point process as the stochastic process on continuous domain of time is commonly used to model the asynchronous event sequence featuring with occurrence timestamps. Thanks to the strong expressivity of deep neural networks, they are emerging as a promising choice for capturing the patterns in asynchronous sequences, in the context of temporal point process. In this paper, we first review recent research emphasis and difficulties in modeling asynchronous event sequences with deep temporal point process, which can be concluded into four fields: encoding of history sequence, formulation of conditional intensity function, relational discovery of events and learning approaches for optimization. We introduce most of recently proposed models by dismantling them into the four parts, and conduct experiments by remodularizing the first three parts with the same learning strategy for a fair empirical evaluation. Besides, we extend the history encoders and conditional intensity function family, and propose a Granger causality discovery framework for exploiting the relations among multi-types of events. Because the Granger causality can be represented by the Granger causality graph, discrete graph structure learning in the framework of Variational Inference is employed to reveal latent structures of the graph. Further experiments show that the proposed framework with latent graph discovery can both capture the relations and achieve an improved fitting and predicting performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to disentangle complex sensory inputs (e.g., image, text) into simple factors of variation (e.g., shape, color) without much supervision. This ability has inspired many works that attempt to solve the following question: how do we invert the data generation process to extract those factors with minimal or no supervision? Several works in the literature on non-linear independent component analysis have established this negative result; without some knowledge of the data generation process or appropriate inductive biases, it is impossible to perform this inversion. In recent years, a lot of progress has been made on disentanglement under structural assumptions, e.g., when we have access to auxiliary information that makes the factors of variation conditionally independent. However, existing work requires a lot of auxiliary information, e.g., in supervised classification, it prescribes that the number of label classes should be at least equal to the total dimension of all factors of variation. In this work, we depart from these assumptions and ask: a) How can we get disentanglement when the auxiliary information does not provide conditional independence over the factors of variation? b) Can we reduce the amount of auxiliary information required for disentanglement? For a class of models where auxiliary information does not ensure conditional independence, we show theoretically and experimentally that disentanglement (to a large extent) is possible even when the auxiliary information dimension is much less than the dimension of the true latent representation.</description>

      <title>Level Up with ML Vulnerability Identification: Leveraging Domain Constraints in Feature Space for Robust Android Malware Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) promises to enhance the efficacy of Android Malware Detection (AMD); however, ML models are vulnerable to realistic evasion attacks--crafting realizable Adversarial Examples (AEs) that satisfy Android malware domain constraints. To eliminate ML vulnerabilities, defenders aim to identify susceptible regions in the feature space where ML models are prone to deception. The primary approach to identifying vulnerable regions involves investigating realizable AEs, but generating these feasible apps poses a challenge. For instance, previous work has relied on generating either feature-space norm-bounded AEs or problem-space realizable AEs in adversarial hardening. The former is efficient but lacks full coverage of vulnerable regions while the latter can uncover these regions by satisfying domain constraints but is known to be time-consuming. To address these limitations, we propose an approach to facilitate the identification of vulnerable regions. Specifically, we introduce a new interpretation of Android domain constraints in the feature space, followed by a novel technique that learns them. Our empirical evaluations across various evasion attacks indicate effective detection of AEs using learned domain constraints, with an average of 89.6%. Furthermore, extensive experiments on different Android malware detectors demonstrate that utilizing our learned domain constraints in Adversarial Training (AT) outperforms other AT-based defenses that rely on norm-bounded AEs or state-of-the-art non-uniform perturbations. Finally, we show that retraining a malware detector with a wide variety of feature-space realizable AEs results in a 77.9% robustness improvement against realizable AEs generated by unknown problem-space transformations, with up to 70x faster training than using problem-space realizable AEs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to Enable Foundation Models in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01708v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the "Foundation Models." In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00181v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the exponential growth of the volume of the ball w.r.t. its radius, the hyperbolic space is capable of embedding trees with arbitrarily small distortion and hence has received wide attention for representing hierarchical datasets. However, this exponential growth property comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we carefully analyze the limitation of two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincar\'e ball and the Lorentz model. We first show that, under the 64 bit arithmetic system, the Poincar\'e ball has a relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points. Then, we theoretically validate the superiority of the Lorentz model over the Poincar\'e ball from the perspective of optimization. Given the numerical limitations of both models, we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate these limitations. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes and exhibits its ability in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.</description>

Abstract: Robust coordination skills enable agents to operate cohesively in shared environments, together towards a common goal and, ideally, individually without hindering each other's progress. To this end, this paper presents Coordinated QMIX (CoMIX), a novel training framework for decentralized agents that enables emergent coordination through flexible policies, allowing at the same time independent decision-making at individual level. CoMIX models selfish and collaborative behavior as incremental steps in each agent's decision process. This allows agents to dynamically adapt their behavior to different situations balancing independence and collaboration. Experiments using a variety of simulation environments demonstrate that CoMIX outperforms baselines on collaborative tasks. The results validate our incremental approach as effective technique for improving coordination in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Conditioning of Score-Based Diffusion Models by Neuro-Symbolic Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when a classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose a method that, given a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model, samples from the conditional distribution under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Differently from other zero-shot techniques, that rather aim at generating valid conditional samples, our method is designed for approximating the true conditional distribution. Firstly, we show how to manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in approximating conditional distributions for various types of constraints and data: tabular data, images and time series.</description>

      <title>Tackling Intertwined Data and Device Heterogeneities in Federated Learning with Unlimited Staleness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13536v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be affected by data and device heterogeneities, caused by clients' different local data distributions and latencies in uploading model updates (i.e., staleness). Traditional schemes consider these heterogeneities as two separate and independent aspects, but this assumption is unrealistic in practical FL scenarios where these heterogeneities are intertwined. In these cases, traditional FL schemes are ineffective, and a better approach is to convert a stale model update into a unstale one. In this paper, we present a new FL framework that ensures the accuracy and computational efficiency of this conversion, hence effectively tackling the intertwined heterogeneities that may cause unlimited staleness in model updates. Our basic idea is to estimate the distributions of clients' local training data from their uploaded stale model updates, and use these estimations to compute unstale client model updates. In this way, our approach does not require any auxiliary dataset nor the clients' local models to be fully trained, and does not incur any additional computation or communication overhead at client devices. We compared our approach with the existing FL strategies on mainstream datasets and models, and showed that our approach can improve the trained model accuracy by up to 25% and reduce the number of required training epochs by up to 35%.

      <title>Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

      <title>Fast and Interpretable Mortality Risk Scores for Critical Care Patients</title>

Abstract: Prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients typically relies on black box models (that are unacceptable for use in hospitals) or hand-tuned interpretable models (that might lead to the loss in performance). We aim to bridge the gap between these two categories by building on modern interpretable ML techniques to design interpretable mortality risk scores that are as accurate as black boxes. We developed a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several important benefits: it uses both hard and soft direct sparsity regularization, it incorporates group sparsity to allow more cohesive models, it allows for monotonicity constraint to include domain knowledge, and it produces many equally-good models, which allows domain experts to choose among them. For evaluation, we leveraged the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets (MIMIC III and eICU). Models produced by GroupFasterRisk outperformed OASIS and SAPS II scores and performed similarly to APACHE IV/IVa while using at most a third of the parameters. For patients with sepsis/septicemia, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and acute kidney failure, GroupFasterRisk models outperformed OASIS and SOFA. Finally, different mortality prediction ML approaches performed better based on variables selected by GroupFasterRisk as compared to OASIS variables. GroupFasterRisk's models performed better than risk scores currently used in hospitals, and on par with black box ML models, while being orders of magnitude sparser. Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of risk scores, it allows design flexibility - the key enabler of practical model creation. GroupFasterRisk is a fast, accessible, and flexible procedure that allows learning a diverse set of sparse risk scores for mortality prediction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Neural Networks Through Causal Discovery and Integration of Domain Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generic methodology to encode hierarchical causality structure among observed variables into a neural network in order to improve its predictive performance. The proposed methodology, called causality-informed neural network (CINN), leverages three coherent steps to systematically map the structural causal knowledge into the layer-to-layer design of neural network while strictly preserving the orientation of every causal relationship. In the first step, CINN discovers causal relationships from observational data via directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning, where causal discovery is recast as a continuous optimization problem to avoid the combinatorial nature. In the second step, the discovered hierarchical causality structure among observed variables is systematically encoded into neural network through a dedicated architecture and customized loss function. By categorizing variables in the causal DAG as root, intermediate, and leaf nodes, the hierarchical causal DAG is translated into CINN with a one-to-one correspondence between nodes in the causal DAG and units in the CINN while maintaining the relative order among these nodes. Regarding the loss function, both intermediate and leaf nodes in the DAG graph are treated as target outputs during CINN training so as to drive co-learning of causal relationships among different types of nodes. As multiple loss components emerge in CINN, we leverage the projection of conflicting gradients to mitigate gradient interference among the multiple learning tasks. Computational experiments across a broad spectrum of UCI data sets demonstrate substantial advantages of CINN in predictive performance over other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, an ablation study underscores the value of integrating structural and quantitative causal knowledge in enhancing the neural network's predictive performance incrementally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91\% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include a novel document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.</description>

      <title>Tracking Changing Probabilities via Dynamic Learners</title>

Abstract: Consider a predictor, a learner, whose input is a stream of discrete items. The predictor's task, at every time point, is probabilistic multiclass prediction, i.e. to predict which item may occur next by outputting zero or more candidate items, each with a probability, after which the actual item is revealed and the predictor updates. To output probabilities, the predictor keeps track of the proportions of the items it has seen. The stream is unbounded (lifelong), and the predictor has finite limited space. The task is open-ended: the set of items is unknown to the predictor and their totality can also grow unbounded. Moreover, there is non-stationarity: the underlying frequencies of items may change, substantially, from time to time. For instance, new items may start appearing and a few recently frequent items may cease to occur again. The predictor, being space-bounded, need only provide probabilities for those items which, at the time of prediction, have sufficiently high frequency, i.e., the salient items. This problem is motivated in the setting of Prediction Games, a self-supervised learning regime where concepts serve as both the predictors and the predictands, and the set of concepts grows over time, resulting in non-stationarities as new concepts are generated and used. We design and study a number of predictors, sparse moving averages(SMAs), for the task. One SMA adapts the sparse exponentiated moving average and another is based on queuing a few counts, keeping dynamic per-item histories. Evaluating the predicted probabilities, under noise and non-stationarity, presents challenges, and we discuss and develop evaluation methods, one based on bounding log-loss. We show that a combination of ideas, supporting dynamic predictand-specific learning rates, offers advantages in terms of faster adaption to change (plasticity), while also supporting low variance (stability).</description>

      <title>Advancing Additive Manufacturing through Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review of Current Progress and Future Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive literature review of deep learning (DL) applications in additive manufacturing (AM). It addresses the need for a thorough analysis in this rapidly growing yet scattered field, aiming to bring together existing knowledge and encourage further development. Our research questions cover three major areas of AM: (i) design for AM, (ii) AM modeling, and (iii) monitoring and control in AM. We use a step-by-step approach following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to select papers from Scopus and Web of Science databases, aligning with our research questions. We include only those papers that implement DL across seven major AM categories - binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization. Our analysis reveals a trend towards using deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks, for generative design in AM. It also highlights an increasing effort to incorporate process physics into DL models to improve AM process modeling and reduce data requirements. Additionally, there is growing interest in using 3D point cloud data for AM process monitoring, alongside traditional 1D and 2D formats. Finally, this paper summarizes the current challenges and recommends some of the promising opportunities in this domain for further investigation with a special focus on (i) generalizing DL models for a wide range of geometry types, (ii) managing uncertainties both in AM data and DL models, (iii) overcoming limited, imbalanced, and noisy AM data issues by incorporating deep generative models, and (iv) unveiling the potential of interpretable DL for AM.</description>

      <title>Locally Convex Global Loss Network for Decision-Focused Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decision-making problems under uncertainty, predicting unknown parameters is often considered independent of the optimization part. Decision-focused learning (DFL) is a task-oriented framework that integrates prediction and optimization by adapting the predictive model to give better decisions for the corresponding task. Here, an inevitable challenge arises when computing the gradients of the optimal decision with respect to the parameters. Existing research copes with this issue by smoothly reforming surrogate optimization or constructing surrogate loss functions that mimic task loss. However, they are applied to restricted optimization domains. In this paper, we propose Locally Convex Global Loss Network (LCGLN), a global surrogate loss model that can be implemented in a general DFL paradigm. LCGLN learns task loss via a partial input convex neural network which is guaranteed to be convex for chosen inputs while keeping the non-convex global structure for the other inputs. This enables LCGLN to admit general DFL through only a single surrogate loss without any sense for choosing appropriate parametric forms. We confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of LCGLN by evaluating our proposed model with three stochastic decision-making problems.</description>

      <title>The Effectiveness of Local Updates for Decentralized Learning under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit two fundamental decentralized optimization methods, Decentralized Gradient Tracking (DGT) and Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD), with multiple local updates. We consider two settings and demonstrate that incorporating local update steps can reduce communication complexity. Specifically, for $\mu$-strongly convex and $L$-smooth loss functions, we proved that local DGT achieves communication complexity {}{$\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big(\frac{L}{\mu(K+1)} + \frac{\delta + {}{\mu}}{\mu (1 - \rho)} + \frac{\rho }{(1 - \rho)^2} \cdot \frac{L+ \delta}{\mu}\Big)$}, %\zhize{seems to be $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$} {where $K$ is the number of additional local update}, $\rho$ measures the network connectivity and $\delta$ measures the second-order heterogeneity of the local losses. Our results reveal the tradeoff between communication and computation and show increasing $K$ can effectively reduce communication costs when the data heterogeneity is low and the network is well-connected. We then consider the over-parameterization regime where the local losses share the same minimums. We proved that employing local updates in DGD, even without gradient correction, achieves exact linear convergence under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, which can yield a similar effect as DGT in reducing communication complexity. {}{Customization of the result to linear models is further provided, with improved rate expression. }Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This work studies sparse adversarial perturbations, including both unstructured and structured ones. We propose a framework based on a white-box PGD-like attack method named Sparse-PGD to effectively and efficiently generate such perturbations. Furthermore, we combine Sparse-PGD with a black-box attack to comprehensively and more reliably evaluate the models' robustness against unstructured and structured sparse adversarial perturbations. Moreover, the efficiency of Sparse-PGD enables us to conduct adversarial training to build robust models against various sparse perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed attack algorithm exhibits strong performance in different scenarios. More importantly, compared with other robust models, our adversarially trained model demonstrates state-of-the-art robustness against various sparse attacks.</description>

Abstract: The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.</description>

      <title>Quantile Activation: Correcting a Failure Mode of ML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An established failure mode for machine learning models occurs when the same features are equally likely to belong to class 0 and class 1. In such cases, existing ML models cannot correctly classify the sample. However, a solvable case emerges when the probabilities of class 0 and 1 vary with the context distribution. To the best of our knowledge, standard neural network architectures like MLPs or CNNs are not equipped to handle this.
  In this article, we propose a simple activation function, quantile activation (QACT), that addresses this problem without significantly increasing computational costs. The core idea is to adapt the outputs of each neuron to its context distribution. The proposed quantile activation, QACT, produces the relative quantile of the sample in its context distribution, rather than the actual values, as in traditional networks.
  A practical example where the same sample can have different labels arises in cases of inherent distribution shift. We validate the proposed activation function under such shifts, using datasets designed to test robustness against distortions : CIFAR10C, CIFAR100C, MNISTC, TinyImagenetC. Our results demonstrate significantly better generalization across distortions compared to conventional classifiers, across various architectures. Although this paper presents a proof of concept, we find that this approach unexpectedly outperforms DINOv2 (small) under large distortions, despite DINOv2 being trained with a much larger network and dataset.</description>

      <title>ARC: A Generalist Graph Anomaly Detector with In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention. However, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset, resulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited generalizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its powerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Gradient Unrolling for Large-Scale Bi-level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi-level optimization (BO) has become a fundamental mathematical framework for addressing hierarchical machine learning problems. As deep learning models continue to grow in size, the demand for scalable bi-level optimization solutions has become increasingly critical. Traditional gradient-based bi-level optimization algorithms, due to their inherent characteristics, are ill-suited to meet the demands of large-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{G}$radient $\textbf{U}$nrolling with $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{F}$radient, abbreviated as $(\textbf{FG})^2\textbf{U}$, which achieves an unbiased stochastic approximation of the meta gradient for bi-level optimization. $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ circumvents the memory and approximation issues associated with classical bi-level optimization approaches, and delivers significantly more accurate gradient estimates than existing large-scale bi-level optimization approaches. Additionally, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ is inherently designed to support parallel computing, enabling it to effectively leverage large-scale distributed computing systems to achieve significant computational efficiency. In practice, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ and other methods can be strategically placed at different stages of the training process to achieve a more cost-effective two-phase paradigm. Further, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ is easy to implement within popular deep learning frameworks, and can be conveniently adapted to address more challenging zeroth-order bi-level optimization scenarios.

      <title>Applications of Scientific Machine Learning for the Analysis of Functionally Graded Porous Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates different Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) approaches for the analysis of functionally graded (FG) porous beams and compares them under a new framework. The beam material properties are assumed to vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The methods consider the output of a neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and derive the equations governing beam behavior based on the continuum formulation. The methods are implemented in the framework and formulated by three approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), (b) the energy approach brings about the Deep Energy Method (DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, which results in a class of Neural Operator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the response of the porous beam with functionally graded material under any porosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results are validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions. The data and code accompanying this manuscript will be publicly available at https://github.com/eshaghi-ms/DeepNetBeam.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph. The source code can be found in https://github.com/zhongjian-zhang/LLM4RGNN.</description>

      <title>Criticality Leveraged Adversarial Training (CLAT) for Boosted Performance via Parameter Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial training enhances neural network robustness but suffers from a tendency to overfit and increased generalization errors on clean data. This work introduces CLAT, an innovative approach that mitigates adversarial overfitting by introducing parameter efficiency into the adversarial training process, improving both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Instead of tuning the entire model, CLAT identifies and fine-tunes robustness-critical layers - those predominantly learning non-robust features - while freezing the remaining model to enhance robustness. It employs dynamic critical layer selection to adapt to changes in layer criticality throughout the fine-tuning process. Empirically, CLAT can be applied on top of existing adversarial training methods, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 95%, and achieves more than a 2% improvement in adversarial robustness compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressive evaluation metrics are indispensable for informative experiments in all areas, and while several metrics are established in some areas, in others, such as feature selection, only indirect or otherwise limited evaluation metrics are found. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric to address several problems of its predecessors and allow for flexible and reliable evaluation of feature selection algorithms. The proposed metric is a dynamic metric with two properties that can be used to evaluate both the performance and the stability of a feature selection algorithm. We conduct several empirical experiments to illustrate the use of the proposed metric in the successful evaluation of feature selection algorithms. We also provide a comparison and analysis to show the different aspects involved in the evaluation of the feature selection algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed metric is successful in carrying out the evaluation task for feature selection algorithms.

      <title>Flow Matching for Optimal Reaction Coordinates of Biomolecular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present flow matching for reaction coordinates (FMRC), a novel deep learning algorithm designed to identify optimal reaction coordinates (RC) in biomolecular reversible dynamics. FMRC is based on the mathematical principles of lumpability and decomposability, which we reformulate into a conditional probability framework for efficient data-driven optimization using deep generative models. While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established transfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics of leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its low-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov state models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the superiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems. In addition, we successfully demonstrated the efficacy of FMRC for bias deposition in the enhanced sampling of a simple model system. Finally, we discuss its potential applications in downstream applications such as enhanced sampling methods and MSM construction.</description>

      <title>The FIX Benchmark: Extracting Features Interpretable to eXperts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</description>

      <title>SageAttention: Accurate 8-Bit Attention for Plug-and-play Inference Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transformer architecture predominates across various models. As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of O(N^2), compared to O(N) for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1 times and 2.7 times, respectively. SageAttention also achieves superior accuracy performance over FlashAttention3. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs almost no end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Horizon-Length Prediction: Advancing Fill-in-the-Middle Capabilities for Code Generation with Lookahead Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) has become integral to code language models, enabling generation of missing code given both left and right contexts. However, the current FIM training paradigm, which reorders original training sequences and then performs regular next-token prediction (NTP), often leads to models struggling to generate content that aligns smoothly with the surrounding context. Crucially, while existing works rely on rule-based post-processing to circumvent this weakness, such methods are not practically usable in open-domain code completion tasks as they depend on restrictive, dataset-specific assumptions (e.g., generating the same number of lines as in the ground truth). Moreover, model performance on FIM tasks deteriorates significantly without these unrealistic assumptions.
  We hypothesize that NTP alone is insufficient for models to learn effective planning conditioned on the distant right context, a critical factor for successful code infilling. To overcome this, we propose Horizon-Length Prediction (HLP), a novel training objective that teaches models to predict the number of remaining middle tokens (i.e., horizon length) at each step. HLP advances FIM with lookahead planning, enabling models to inherently learn infilling boundaries for arbitrary left and right contexts without relying on dataset-specific post-processing. Our evaluation across different models and sizes shows that HLP significantly improves FIM performance by up to 24% relatively on diverse benchmarks, across file-level and repository-level, and without resorting to unrealistic post-processing methods. Furthermore, the enhanced planning capability gained through HLP boosts model performance on code reasoning. Importantly, HLP only incurs negligible training overhead and no additional inference cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cluster-wise Graph Transformer with Dual-granularity Kernelized Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of graph learning, there is a category of methods that conceptualize graphs as hierarchical structures, utilizing node clustering to capture broader structural information. While generally effective, these methods often rely on a fixed graph coarsening routine, leading to overly homogeneous cluster representations and loss of node-level information. In this paper, we envision the graph as a network of interconnected node sets without compressing each cluster into a single embedding. To enable effective information transfer among these node sets, we propose the Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism. N2C-Attn incorporates techniques from Multiple Kernel Learning into the kernelized attention framework, effectively capturing information at both node and cluster levels. We then devise an efficient form for N2C-Attn using the cluster-wise message-passing framework, achieving linear time complexity. We further analyze how N2C-Attn combines bi-level feature maps of queries and keys, demonstrating its capability to merge dual-granularity information. The resulting architecture, Cluster-wise Graph Transformer (Cluster-GT), which uses node clusters as tokens and employs our proposed N2C-Attn module, shows superior performance on various graph-level tasks.

      <title>Is Parameter Collision Hindering Continual Learning in LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, making continual learning (CL) essential for their dynamic deployment. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as O-LoRA, typically focus on constructing orthogonality tasks to decouple parameter interdependence from various domains.In this paper, we reveal that building non-collision parameters is a more critical factor in addressing CL challenges. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that non-collision parameters can provide better task orthogonality, which is a sufficient but unnecessary condition. Furthermore, knowledge from multiple domains will be preserved in non-collision parameter subspaces, making it more difficult to forget previously seen data. Leveraging this insight, we propose Non-collision Low-Rank Adaptation (N-LoRA), a simple yet effective approach leveraging low collision rates to enhance CL in LLMs. Experimental results on multiple CL benchmarks indicate that N-LoRA achieves superior performance (+2.9), higher task orthogonality (*4.1 times), and lower parameter collision (*58.1 times) than SOTA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) studies the problem where agents receive only preferences over pairs of trajectories in each episode. Traditional approaches in this field have predominantly focused on the mean reward or utility criterion. However, in RLHF scenarios demanding heightened risk awareness, such as in AI systems, healthcare, and agriculture, risk-aware measures are requisite. Traditional risk-aware objectives and algorithms are not applicable in such one-episode-reward settings. To address this, we explore and prove the applicability of two risk-aware objectives to RLHF: nested and static quantile risk objectives. We also introduce Risk-Aware-RLHF (RA-RLHF), an algorithm designed to optimize both nested and static objectives. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regret upper bounds, demonstrating that they are sublinear with respect to the number of episodes, and present empirical results to support our findings.

      <title>Identifiability Guarantees for Causal Disentanglement from Purely Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal disentanglement aims to learn about latent causal factors behind data, holding the promise to augment existing representation learning methods in terms of interpretability and extrapolation. Recent advances establish identifiability results assuming that interventions on (single) latent factors are available; however, it remains debatable whether such assumptions are reasonable due to the inherent nature of intervening on latent variables. Accordingly, we reconsider the fundamentals and ask what can be learned using just observational data.
  We provide a precise characterization of latent factors that can be identified in nonlinear causal models with additive Gaussian noise and linear mixing, without any interventions or graphical restrictions. In particular, we show that the causal variables can be identified up to a layer-wise transformation and that further disentanglement is not possible. We transform these theoretical results into a practical algorithm consisting of solving a quadratic program over the score estimation of the observed data. We provide simulation results to support our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our algorithm can derive meaningful causal representations from purely observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction helps to achieve supply-demand balance in energy systems, supporting decision-making and scheduling. Traditional models, lacking AI-assisted automation, rely on experts, incur high costs, and struggle with sparse data prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Energy Forecasting Large Language Model (EF-LLM), which integrates domain knowledge and temporal data for time-series forecasting, supporting both pre-forecast operations and post-forecast decision-support. EF-LLM's human-AI interaction capabilities lower the entry barrier in forecasting tasks, reducing the need for extra expert involvement. To achieve this, we propose a continual learning approach with updatable LoRA and a multi-channel architecture for aligning heterogeneous multimodal data, enabling EF-LLM to continually learn heterogeneous multimodal knowledge. In addition, EF-LLM enables accurate predictions under sparse data conditions through its ability to process multimodal data. We propose Fusion Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (F-PEFT) method to effectively leverage both time-series data and text for this purpose. EF-LLM is also the first energy-specific LLM to detect hallucinations and quantify their occurrence rate, achieved via multi-task learning, semantic similarity analysis, and ANOVA. We have achieved success in energy prediction scenarios for load, photovoltaic, and wind power forecast.</description>

      <title>FPPL: An Efficient and Non-IID Robust Federated Continual Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to learn from sequential data stream in the decentralized federated learning setting, while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in classical continual learning. Existing FCL methods usually employ typical rehearsal mechanisms, which could result in privacy violations or additional onerous storage and computational burdens. In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting.

      <title>MrSteve: Instruction-Following Agents in Minecraft with What-Where-When Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</description>

      <title>SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

      <description>arXiv:2411.11465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for easily adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to various tasks. However, our understanding of how ICL works remains limited. We explore a simple model of ICL in a controlled setup with synthetic training data to investigate ICL of univariate linear functions. We experiment with a range of GPT-2-like transformer models trained from scratch. Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative that transformers adopt algorithmic approaches like linear regression to learn a linear function in-context. These models fail to generalize beyond their training distribution, highlighting fundamental limitations in their capacity to infer abstract task structures. Our experiments lead us to propose a mathematically precise hypothesis of what the model might be learning.</description>

      <title>Go With the Flow: Fast Diffusion for Gaussian Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges (SB) are diffusion processes that steer, in finite time, a given initial distribution to another final one while minimizing a suitable cost functional. Although various methods for computing SBs have recently been proposed in the literature, most of these approaches require computationally expensive training schemes, even for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an analytic parametrization of a set of feasible policies for steering the distribution of a dynamical system from one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to another. Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization techniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the solution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly with the number of components in each mixture. Furthermore, our method generalizes naturally to more general classes of dynamical systems such as controllable Linear Time-Varying systems that cannot currently be solved using traditional neural SB approaches. We showcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems such as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder, and various other examples. We also benchmark our approach on an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while requiring virtually no training.</description>

      <title>CwA-T: A Channelwise AutoEncoder with Transformer for EEG Abnormality Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CwA-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CwA-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

      <title>Explainable AI for Multivariate Time Series Pattern Exploration: Latent Space Visual Analytics with Temporal Fusion Transformer and Variational Autoencoders in Power Grid Event Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.</description>

      <title>HashEvict: A Pre-Attention KV Cache Eviction Strategy using Locality-Sensitive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.</description>

      <title>GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has become a hot topic in the field of graph representation learning. In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations. Theoretical analysis verifies the trustworthiness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art empirical performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked the possibility of about Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a hypothetical AI system surpassing human intelligence. However, existing alignment paradigms struggle to guide such advanced AI systems. Superalignment, the alignment of AI systems with human values and safety requirements at superhuman levels of capability aims to addresses two primary goals -- scalability in supervision to provide high-quality guidance signals and robust governance to ensure alignment with human values. In this survey, we examine scalable oversight methods and potential solutions for superalignment. Specifically, we explore the concept of ASI, the challenges it poses, and the limitations of current alignment paradigms in addressing the superalignment problem. Then we review scalable oversight methods for superalignment. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and propose pathways for the safe and continual improvement of ASI systems. By comprehensively reviewing the current literature, our goal is provide a systematical introduction of existing methods, analyze their strengths and limitations, and discuss potential future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, achieving impressive results on diverse data types, including images, videos, and texts. However, DNNs still lag behind Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) on tabular data, a format extensively utilized across various domains. In this paper, we propose DOFEN, short for \textbf{D}eep \textbf{O}blivious \textbf{F}orest \textbf{EN}semble, a novel DNN architecture inspired by oblivious decision trees. DOFEN constructs relaxed oblivious decision trees (rODTs) by randomly combining conditions for each column and further enhances performance with a two-level rODT forest ensembling process. By employing this approach, DOFEN achieves state-of-the-art results among DNNs and further narrows the gap between DNNs and tree-based models on the well-recognized benchmark: Tabular Benchmark \citep{grinsztajn2022tree}, which includes 73 total datasets spanning a wide array of domains. The code of DOFEN is available at: \url{https://github.com/Sinopac-Digital-Technology-Division/DOFEN}.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design for Continual Learning in IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a new online learning technique over sequentially generated streaming data from different tasks, aiming to maintain a small forgetting loss on previously-learned tasks. Existing work focuses on reducing the forgetting loss under a given task sequence. However, if similar tasks continuously appear to the end time, the forgetting loss is still huge on prior distinct tasks. In practical IoT networks, an autonomous vehicle to sample data and learn different tasks can route and alter the order of task pattern at increased travelling cost. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how to opportunistically route the testing object and alter the task sequence in CL. We formulate a new optimization problem and prove it NP-hard. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm to achieve approximation ratios of $\frac{3}{2}$ for underparameterized case and $\frac{3}{2} + r^{1-T}$ for overparameterized case, respectively, where $r:=1-\frac{n}{m}$ is a parameter of feature number $m$ and sample number $n$ and $T$ is the task number. Simulation results verify our algorithm's close-to-optimum performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks typically rely on a single forward pass for inference, which can limit their capacity to resolve ambiguous inputs. We introduce Contextual Backpropagation Loops (CBLs) as an iterative mechanism that incorporates top-down feedback to refine intermediate representations, thereby improving accuracy and robustness. This repeated process mirrors how humans continuously re-interpret sensory information in daily life-by checking and re-checking our perceptions using contextual cues. Our results suggest that CBLs can offer a straightforward yet powerful way to incorporate such contextual reasoning in modern deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory for IV-Based Reinforcement Learning with Potential Endogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.04021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard data analysis framework, data is collected (once and for all), and then data analysis is carried out. However, with the advancement of digital technology, decision-makers constantly analyze past data and generate new data through their decisions. We model this as a Markov decision process and show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis leads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the endogeneity problem in standard data analysis. We propose a class of instrument variable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the bias and establish their theoretical properties by incorporating them into a stochastic approximation (SA) framework. Our analysis accommodates iterate-dependent Markovian structures and, therefore, can be used to study RL algorithms with policy improvement. We also provide formulas for inference on optimal policies of the IV-RL algorithms. These formulas highlight how intertemporal dependencies of the Markovian environment affect the inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to optimize the binary detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on emphysema presence in the lung with convolutional neural networks (CNN) by exploring manually adjusted versus automated window-setting optimization (WSO) on computed tomography (CT) images. 7,194 CT images (3,597 with COPD; 3,597 healthy controls) from 78 subjects were selected retrospectively (10.2018-12.2021) and preprocessed. For each image, intensity values were manually clipped to the emphysema window setting and a baseline 'full-range' window setting. Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained 3,392, 1,114, and 2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by comparing various CNN architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented by adding a customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95% confidence] was utilized to compare model variations. Repeated inference (n=7) on the test set showed that the DenseNet was the most efficient backbone and achieved a mean AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] without WSO. Comparably, with input images manually adjusted to the emphysema window, the DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean AUC of 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]. By adding a customized WSO layer to the DenseNet, an optimal window in the proximity of the emphysema window setting was learned automatically, and a mean AUC of 0.82 [0.78, 0.86] was achieved. Detection of COPD with DenseNet models was improved by WSO of CT data to the emphysema window setting range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA). Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to construct various MBQC-based Ans\"atze for parameterized quantum circuits, demonstrating that the different Ans\"atze may lead to significantly different performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of Hardware-efficient Ans\"atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally invariant gates such as neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>AgentBoard: An Analytical Evaluation Board of Multi-turn LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis. This not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the interpretability of their performance to the forefront. Ultimately, AgentBoard serves as a step towards demystifying agent behaviors and accelerating the development of stronger LLM agents.</description>

      <title>ProCNS: Progressive Prototype Calibration and Noise Suppression for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) has emerged as a solution to mitigate the conflict between annotation cost and model performance by adopting sparse annotation formats (e.g., point, scribble, block, etc.). Typical approaches attempt to exploit anatomy and topology priors to directly expand sparse annotations into pseudo-labels. However, due to a lack of attention to the ambiguous edges in medical images and insufficient exploration of sparse supervision, existing approaches tend to generate erroneous and overconfident pseudo proposals in noisy regions, leading to cumulative model error and performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel WSS approach, named ProCNS, encompassing two synergistic modules devised with the principles of progressive prototype calibration and noise suppression. Specifically, we design a Prototype-based Regional Spatial Affinity (PRSA) loss to maximize the pair-wise affinities between spatial and semantic elements, providing our model of interest with more reliable guidance. The affinities are derived from the input images and the prototype-refined predictions. Meanwhile, we propose an Adaptive Noise Perception and Masking (ANPM) module to obtain more enriched and representative prototype representations, which adaptively identifies and masks noisy regions within the pseudo proposals, reducing potential erroneous interference during prototype computation. Furthermore, we generate specialized soft pseudo-labels for the noisy regions identified by ANPM, providing supplementary supervision. Extensive experiments on six medical image segmentation tasks involving different modalities demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Mutual Excitation for Hand-to-Hand and Human-to-Human Interaction Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing interactive actions, including hand-to-hand interaction and human-to-human interaction, has attracted increasing attention for various applications in the field of video analysis and human-robot interaction. Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.</description>

Abstract: Bandit convex optimisation is a fundamental framework for studying zeroth-order convex optimisation. These notes cover the many tools used for this problem, including cutting plane methods, interior point methods, continuous exponential weights, gradient descent and online Newton step. The nuances between the many assumptions and setups are explained. Although there is not much truly new here, some existing tools are applied in novel ways to obtain new algorithms. A few bounds are improved in minor ways.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition in Diffusion Models Reveals the Hierarchical Nature of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of real data is paramount in advancing modern deep-learning methodologies. Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organized in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying compositional structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time $t$ is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed, but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.</description>

      <title>DelGrad: Exact event-based gradients in spiking networks for training delays and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in less number of required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.</description>

      <title>Improving robustness to corruptions with multiplicative weight perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations.</description>

      <title>Future Events as Backdoor Triggers: Investigating Temporal Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Flow Map Learning of PDEs from Incomplete, Limited, and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational technique for modeling the evolution of dynamical systems in a reduced basis, with a focus on the challenging problem of modeling partially-observed partial differential equations (PDEs) on high-dimensional non-uniform grids. We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This allows for rapid high-resolution simulations, enabled by smaller training data sets and reduced training times.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source EEG Emotion Recognition via Dynamic Contrastive Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides reliable indications of human cognition and mental states. Accurate emotion recognition from EEG remains challenging due to signal variations among individuals and across measurement sessions. We introduce a multi-source dynamic contrastive domain adaptation method (MS-DCDA) based on differential entropy (DE) features, in which coarse-grained inter-domain and fine-grained intra-class adaptations are modeled through a multi-branch contrastive neural network and contrastive sub-domain discrepancy learning. Leveraging domain knowledge from each individual source and a complementary source ensemble, our model uses dynamically weighted learning to achieve an optimal tradeoff between domain transferability and discriminability. The proposed MS-DCDA model was evaluated using the SEED and SEED-IV datasets, achieving respectively the highest mean accuracies of $90.84\%$ and $78.49\%$ in cross-subject experiments as well as $95.82\%$ and $82.25\%$ in cross-session experiments. Our model outperforms several alternative domain adaptation methods in recognition accuracy, inter-class margin, and intra-class compactness. Our study also suggests greater emotional sensitivity in the frontal and parietal brain lobes, providing insights for mental health interventions, personalized medicine, and preventive strategies.</description>

      <title>SpikingSSMs: Learning Long Sequences with Sparse and Parallel Spiking State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Global Optimality in Bilevel Optimization: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization has witnessed a resurgence of interest, driven by its critical role in trustworthy and efficient AI applications. While many recent works have established convergence to stationary points or local minima, obtaining the global optimum of bilevel optimization remains an important yet open problem. The difficulty lies in the fact that, unlike many prior non-convex single-level problems, bilevel problems often do not admit a benign landscape, and may indeed have multiple spurious local solutions. Nevertheless, attaining global optimality is indispensable for ensuring reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness, particularly in high-stakes engineering applications that rely on bilevel optimization. In this paper, we first explore the challenges of establishing a global convergence theory for bilevel optimization, and present two sufficient conditions for global convergence. We provide algorithm-dependent proofs to rigorously substantiate these sufficient conditions on two specific bilevel learning scenarios: representation learning and data hypercleaning (a.k.a. reweighting). Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating convergence to the global minimum in both cases.</description>

      <title>Deep Adaptive Interest Network: Personalized Recommendation with Context-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In personalized recommendation systems, accurately capturing users' evolving interests and combining them with contextual information is a critical research area. This paper proposes a novel model called the Deep Adaptive Interest Network (DAIN), which dynamically models users' interests while incorporating context-aware learning mechanisms to achieve precise and adaptive personalized recommendations. DAIN leverages deep learning techniques to build an adaptive interest network structure that can capture users' interest changes in real-time while further optimizing recommendation results by integrating contextual information. Experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that DAIN excels in both recommendation performance and computational efficiency. This research not only provides a new solution for personalized recommendation systems but also offers fresh insights into the application of context-aware learning in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>PIETRA: Physics-Informed Evidential Learning for Traversing Out-of-Distribution Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful approach for developing traversability models for off-road navigation, but these models often struggle with inputs unseen during training. Existing methods utilize techniques like evidential deep learning to quantify model uncertainty, helping to identify and avoid out-of-distribution terrain. However, always avoiding out-of-distribution terrain can be overly conservative, e.g., when novel terrain can be effectively analyzed using a physics-based model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability (PIETRA), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates physics priors directly into the mathematical formulation of evidential neural networks and introduces physics knowledge implicitly through an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed training loss. Our evidential network seamlessly transitions between learned and physics-based predictions for out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, the physics-informed loss regularizes the learned model, ensuring better alignment with the physics model. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that PIETRA improves both learning accuracy and navigation performance in environments with significant distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Data-driven decision-making under uncertainty with entropic risk measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entropic risk measure is widely used in high-stakes decision making to account for tail risks associated with an uncertain loss. With limited data, the empirical entropic risk estimator, i.e. replacing the expectation in the entropic risk measure with a sample average, underestimates the true risk. To debias the empirical entropic risk estimator, we propose a strongly asymptotically consistent bootstrapping procedure. The first step of the procedure involves fitting a distribution to the data, whereas the second step estimates the bias of the empirical entropic risk estimator using bootstrapping, and corrects for it. We show that naively fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data using the maximum likelihood criterion typically leads to an underestimation of the risk. To mitigate this issue, we consider two alternative methods: a more computationally demanding one that fits the distribution of empirical entropic risk, and a simpler one that fits the extreme value distribution. As an application of the approach, we study a distributionally robust entropic risk minimization problem with type-$\infty$ Wasserstein ambiguity set, where debiasing the validation performance using our techniques significantly improves the calibration of the size of the ambiguity set. Furthermore, we propose a distributionally robust optimization model for a well-studied insurance contract design problem. The model considers multiple (potential) policyholders that have dependent risks and the insurer and policyholders use entropic risk measure. We show that cross validation methods can result in significantly higher out-of-sample risk for the insurer if the bias in validation performance is not corrected for. This improvement can be explained from the observation that our methods suggest a higher (and more accurate) premium to homeowners.</description>

      <title>TableRAG: Million-Token Table Understanding with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</description>

      <title>Variational Diffusion Posterior Sampling with Midpoint Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown considerable potential in solving Bayesian inverse problems when used as priors. However, sampling from the resulting denoising posterior distributions remains a challenge as it involves intractable terms. To tackle this issue, state-of-the-art approaches formulate the problem as that of sampling from a surrogate diffusion model targeting the posterior and decompose its scores into two terms: the prior score and an intractable guidance term. While the former is replaced by the pre-trained score of the considered diffusion model, the guidance term has to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilises a decomposition of the transitions which, in contrast to previous methods, allows a trade-off between the complexity of the intractable guidance term and that of the prior transitions. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, including challenging cases with latent diffusion models as priors. We then demonstrate its applicability to various modalities and its promising impact on public health by tackling cardiovascular disease diagnosis through the reconstruction of incomplete electrocardiograms.

      <title>Adversarial Score identity Distillation: Rapidly Surpassing the Teacher in One Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved SOTA performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, its ultimate performance is constrained by how accurate the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, allowing it to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when distilled from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models, achieving FID scores of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. When distilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet 512x512, our SiDA method surpasses even the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL, which achieved an FID of 1.81 using classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 63 generation steps. In contrast, SiDA achieves FID scores of 2.156 for size XS, 1.669 for S, 1.488 for M, 1.413 for L, 1.379 for XL, and 1.366 for XXL, all without CFG and in a single generation step. These results highlight substantial improvements across all model sizes. Our code is available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD/tree/sida.</description>

      <title>ConSinger: Efficient High-Fidelity Singing Voice Generation with Minimal Steps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is expected to generate high-fidelity singing voice from given music scores (lyrics, duration and pitch). Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality.

      <title>Diff-Instruct*: Towards Human-Preferred One-step Text-to-image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct* (DI*), an image data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides the strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also confirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving image layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors. We have released our industry-ready model on the homepage: \url{https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_star}.</description>

      <title>On the loss of context-awareness in general instruction fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, where context awareness is defined as the ability to extract and understand information from user-provided context and respond accordingly. We are the first to identify and show that the loss of context awareness, as reflected by the performance drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test, occurs in instruction fine-tuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to input prompts. We identify that the performance decline is partially caused by an attention bias toward different roles learned during conversational instruction fine-tuning. We validate our hypothesis by visualizing changes in attention allocation after the chat template is applied and manually steering the attention heads. Based on these observations, we propose a metric to select context-dependent examples from general instruction fine-tuning datasets. We then apply conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator, enabling the model to learn context awareness from these selected examples. Empirical experiments on four context-dependent downstream tasks and three pre-trained LLMs of different sizes show that our method effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising general instruction-following capabilities. Given our findings, we strongly advocate for careful benchmarking of context awareness after instruction fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Facets of Language Generation in the Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Kleinberg &amp; Mullainathan [KM24] provides a concrete model for language generation in the limit: given a sequence of examples from an unknown target language, the goal is to generate new examples from the target language such that no incorrect examples are generated beyond some point. In sharp contrast to strong negative results for the closely related problem of language identification, they establish positive results for language generation in the limit for all countable collections of languages. Follow-up work by Raman &amp; Tewari [RT24] studies bounds on the number of distinct inputs required by an algorithm before correct language generation is achieved -- namely, whether this is a constant for all languages in the collection (uniform generation) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform generation).
  We show that every countable language collection has a generator which has the stronger property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while the generation algorithm of [KM24] can be implemented using membership queries, we show that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections of just two languages, using only membership queries.
  We also formalize the tension between validity and breadth in the generation algorithm of [KM24] by introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and show a strong negative result for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that a tradeoff between validity and breadth is inherent for generation in the limit. We also provide a precise characterization of the language collections for which exhaustive generation is possible. Finally, inspired by algorithms that can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of uniform generation with feedback, completely characterizing language collections for which such uniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of a complexity measure of the collection.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Dynamic Models Hybridisation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-based dynamic models (PBDMs) are simplified representations of complex dynamical systems. PBDMs take specific processes within a complex system and assign a fragment of variables and an accompanying set of parameters to depict the processes. As this often leads to suboptimal parameterisation of the system, a key challenge requires refining the empirical parameters and variables to reduce uncertainties while maintaining the model s explainability and enhancing its predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that a hybrid mosquito population dynamics model, which integrates a PBDM with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), retains the explainability of the PBDM by incorporating the PINN-learned model parameters in place of its empirical counterparts. Specifically, we address the limitations of traditional PBDMs by modelling the parameters of larva and pupa development rates using a PINN that encodes complex, learned interactions of air temperature, precipitation and humidity. Our results demonstrate improved mosquito population simulations including the difficult-to-predict mosquito population peaks. This opens the possibility of hybridisation concept application on other complex systems based on PBDMs such as cancer growth to address the challenges posed by scarce and noisy data, and to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling to overcome the gap between physics-based and data-driven weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>TransferLight: Zero-Shot Traffic Signal Control on any Road-Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control plays a crucial role in urban mobility. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</description>

      <title>A Pioneering Neural Network Method for Efficient and Robust Fuel Sloshing Simulation in Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</description>

Abstract: Accurately predicting the trajectory of vehicles is critically important for ensuring safety and reliability in autonomous driving. Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541</link>

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</description>

      <title>TH\"OR-MAGNI Act: Actions for Human Motion Modeling in Robot-Shared Industrial Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate human activity and trajectory prediction are crucial for ensuring safe and reliable human-robot interactions in dynamic environments, such as industrial settings, with mobile robots. Datasets with fine-grained action labels for moving people in industrial environments with mobile robots are scarce, as most existing datasets focus on social navigation in public spaces. This paper introduces the TH\"OR-MAGNI Act dataset, a substantial extension of the TH\"OR-MAGNI dataset, which captures participant movements alongside robots in diverse semantic and spatial contexts. TH\"OR-MAGNI Act provides 8.3 hours of manually labeled participant actions derived from egocentric videos recorded via eye-tracking glasses. These actions, aligned with the provided TH\"OR-MAGNI motion cues, follow a long-tailed distribution with diversified acceleration, velocity, and navigation distance profiles. We demonstrate the utility of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act for two tasks: action-conditioned trajectory prediction and joint action and trajectory prediction. We propose two efficient transformer-based models that outperform the baselines to address these tasks. These results underscore the potential of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act to develop predictive models for enhanced human-robot interaction in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Log-Time K-Means Clustering for 1D Data: Novel Approaches with Proof and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a key task in machine learning, with $k$-means being widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. While 1D clustering is common, existing methods often fail to exploit the structure of 1D data, leading to inefficiencies. This thesis introduces optimized algorithms for $k$-means++ initialization and Lloyd's algorithm, leveraging sorted data, prefix sums, and binary search for improved computational performance. The main contributions are: (1) an optimized $k$-cluster algorithm achieving $O(l \cdot k^2 \cdot \log n)$ complexity for greedy $k$-means++ initialization and $O(i \cdot k \cdot \log n)$ for Lloyd's algorithm, where $l$ is the number of greedy $k$-means++ local trials, and $i$ is the number of Lloyd's algorithm iterations, and (2) a binary search-based two-cluster algorithm, achieving $O(\log n)$ runtime with deterministic convergence to a Lloyd's algorithm local minimum. Benchmarks demonstrate over a 4500x speedup compared to scikit-learn for large datasets while maintaining clustering quality measured by within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). Additionally, the algorithms achieve a 300x speedup in an LLM quantization task, highlighting their utility in emerging applications. This thesis bridges theory and practice for 1D $k$-means clustering, delivering efficient and sound algorithms implemented in a JIT-optimized open-source Python library.</description>

      <title>Tacit Learning with Adaptive Information Selection for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework has gained widespread adoption due to its strong performance. However, the further development of CTDE faces two key challenges. First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of input information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making abilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial observability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on information selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually develop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the cooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication, relying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and selection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on environmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Experiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>MacLight: Multi-scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods have proposed promising traffic signal control policy that can be trained on large road networks. Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation.
  In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

      <title>Cross-Attention Graph Neural Networks for Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks with Skewed Degree Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Our codes used in this paper are publicly available at: https://github.com/kikixiong/XATGRN.</description>

      <title>Integrating Random Effects in Variational Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction of Correlated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are widely used for dimensionality reduction of large-scale tabular and image datasets, under the assumption of independence between data observations. In practice, however, datasets are often correlated, with typical sources of correlation including spatial, temporal and clustering structures. Inspired by the literature on linear mixed models (LMM), we propose LMMVAE -- a novel model which separates the classic VAE latent model into fixed and random parts. While the fixed part assumes the latent variables are independent as usual, the random part consists of latent variables which are correlated between similar clusters in the data such as nearby locations or successive measurements. The classic VAE architecture and loss are modified accordingly. LMMVAE is shown to improve squared reconstruction error and negative likelihood loss significantly on unseen data, with simulated as well as real datasets from various applications and correlation scenarios. It also shows improvement in the performance of downstream tasks such as supervised classification on the learned representations.</description>

      <title>Distilled Decoding 1: One-step Sampling of Image Auto-regressive Models with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID&gt;100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

      <title>The Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks for Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of cancer is critical in improving treatment outcomes and increasing survival rates, particularly for common cancers such as lung, breast, and prostate which collectively contribute to a significant global mortality burden. With advancements in imaging technologies and data processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and classifying medical images, enabling more precise cancer detection. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies leveraging CNN models for detecting ten different types of cancer. Each study employs distinct CNN architectures to identify patterns associated with these cancers, utilizing diverse datasets. Key differences and strengths of these architectures are meticulously compared and analyzed, highlighting their efficacy in improving early detection. Beyond reviewing the performance and limitations of CNN-based cancer detection methods, this study explores the feasibility of integrating CNNs into clinical settings as an early detection tool, potentially complementing or replacing traditional methods. Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including data diversity, result interpretation, and ethical considerations. By identifying the best-performing CNN architectures and providing a comparative analysis, this study aims to contribute a comprehensive perspective on the application of CNNs in cancer detection and their role in advancing diagnostic capabilities in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Towards An Unsupervised Learning Scheme for Efficiently Solving Parameterized Mixed-Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised learning scheme for accelerating the solution of a family of mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. Distinct substantially from existing learning-to-optimize methods, our proposal seeks to train an autoencoder (AE) for binary variables in an unsupervised learning fashion, using data of optimal solutions to historical instances for a parametric family of MIPs. By a deliberate design of AE architecture and exploitation of its statistical implication, we present a simple and straightforward strategy to construct a class of cutting plane constraints from the decoder parameters of an offline-trained AE. These constraints reliably enclose the optimal binary solutions of new problem instances thanks to the representation strength of the AE. More importantly, their integration into the primal MIP problem leads to a tightened MIP with the reduced feasible region, which can be resolved at decision time using off-the-shelf solvers with much higher efficiency. Our method is applied to a benchmark batch process scheduling problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of off-the-shelf MILP solvers while retaining a high solution quality.
