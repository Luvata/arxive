      <title>Agents Thinking Fast and Slow: A Talker-Reasoner Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents of all kinds to interact with users through natural conversation. Consequently, agents now have two jobs: conversing and planning/reasoning. Their conversational responses must be informed by all available information, and their actions must help to achieve goals. This dichotomy between conversing with the user and doing multi-step reasoning and planning can be seen as analogous to the human systems of "thinking fast and slow" as introduced by Kahneman. Our approach is comprised of a "Talker" agent (System 1) that is fast and intuitive, and tasked with synthesizing the conversational response; and a "Reasoner" agent (System 2) that is slower, more deliberative, and more logical, and is tasked with multi-step reasoning and planning, calling tools, performing actions in the world, and thereby producing the new agent state. We describe the new Talker-Reasoner architecture and discuss its advantages, including modularity and decreased latency. We ground the discussion in the context of a sleep coaching agent, in order to demonstrate real-world relevance.</description>

      <title>Large Legislative Models: Towards Efficient AI Policymaking in Economic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The improvement of economic policymaking presents an opportunity for broad societal benefit, a notion that has inspired research towards AI-driven policymaking tools. AI policymaking holds the potential to surpass human performance through the ability to process data quickly at scale. However, existing RL-based methods exhibit sample inefficiency, and are further limited by an inability to flexibly incorporate nuanced information into their decision-making processes. Thus, we propose a novel method in which we instead utilize pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), as sample-efficient policymakers in socially complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scenarios. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains, outperforming existing methods across three environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/hegasz/large-legislative-models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Vital Sign Monitoring in Resource-Constrained Maternal Care: An RL-Based Restless Bandit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maternal mortality remains a significant global public health challenge. One promising approach to reducing maternal deaths occurring during facility-based childbirth is through early warning systems, which require the consistent monitoring of mothers' vital signs after giving birth. Wireless vital sign monitoring devices offer a labor-efficient solution for continuous monitoring, but their scarcity raises the critical question of how to allocate them most effectively. We devise an allocation algorithm for this problem by modeling it as a variant of the popular Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) paradigm. In doing so, we identify and address novel, previously unstudied constraints unique to this domain, which render previous approaches for RMABs unsuitable and significantly increase the complexity of the learning and planning problem. To overcome these challenges, we adopt the popular Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from reinforcement learning to learn an allocation policy by training a policy and value function network. We demonstrate in simulations that our approach outperforms the best heuristic baseline by up to a factor of $4$.</description>

      <title>$\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L: Autonomous Evaluation of LLMs for Truth Maintenance and Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on $\forall$uto$\exists$$\lor\!\land$L is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update.</description>

      <title>GIVE: Structured Reasoning with Knowledge Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing retrieval-based reasoning approaches for large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on the density and quality of the non-parametric knowledge source to provide domain knowledge and explicit reasoning chain. However, inclusive knowledge sources are expensive and sometimes infeasible to build for scientific or corner domains. To tackle the challenges, we introduce Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning framework that integrates the parametric and non-parametric memories to enhance both knowledge retrieval and faithful reasoning processes on very sparse knowledge graphs. By leveraging the external structured knowledge to inspire LLM to model the interconnections among relevant concepts, our method facilitates a more logical and step-wise reasoning approach akin to experts' problem-solving, rather than gold answer retrieval. Specifically, the framework prompts LLMs to decompose the query into crucial concepts and attributes, construct entity groups with relevant entities, and build an augmented reasoning chain by probing potential relationships among node pairs across these entity groups. Our method incorporates both factual and extrapolated linkages to enable comprehensive understanding and response generation. Extensive experiments on reasoning-intense benchmarks on biomedical and commonsense QA demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, GIVE enables GPT3.5-turbo to outperform advanced models like GPT4 without any additional training cost, thereby underscoring the efficacy of integrating structured information and internal reasoning ability of LLMs for tackling specialized tasks with limited external resources.</description>

      <title>Baichuan-Omni Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Baichuan-Omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for AI-driven data quality monitoring in high-volume data environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for an AI-driven data quality monitoring system designed to address the challenges of maintaining data quality in high-volume environments. We examine the limitations of traditional methods in managing the scale, velocity, and variety of big data and propose a conceptual approach leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Our framework outlines a system architecture that incorporates anomaly detection, classification, and predictive analytics for real-time, scalable data quality management. Key components include an intelligent data ingestion layer, adaptive preprocessing mechanisms, context-aware feature extraction, and AI-based quality assessment modules. A continuous learning paradigm is central to our framework, ensuring adaptability to evolving data patterns and quality requirements. We also address implications for scalability, privacy, and integration within existing data ecosystems. While practical results are not provided, it lays a robust theoretical foundation for future research and implementations, advancing data quality management and encouraging the exploration of AI-driven solutions in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>What killed the cat? Towards a logical formalization of curiosity (and suspense, and surprise) in narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework in which the three emotions at the heart of narrative tension (curiosity, suspense and surprise) are formalized. This framework is built on nonmonotonic reasoning which allows us to compactly represent the default behavior of the world and to simulate the affective evolution of an agent receiving a story. After formalizing the notions of awareness, curiosity, surprise and suspense, we explore the properties induced by our definitions and study the computational complexity of detecting them. We finally propose means to evaluate these emotions' intensity for a given agent listening to a story.</description>

      <title>Words as Beacons: Guiding RL Agents with High-Level Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse reward environments in reinforcement learning (RL) pose significant challenges for exploration, often leading to inefficient or incomplete learning processes. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a teacher-student RL framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as "teachers" to guide the agent's learning process by decomposing complex tasks into subgoals. Due to their inherent capability to understand RL environments based on a textual description of structure and purpose, LLMs can provide subgoals to accomplish the task defined for the environment in a similar fashion to how a human would do. In doing so, three types of subgoals are proposed: positional targets relative to the agent, object representations, and language-based instructions generated directly by the LLM. More importantly, we show that it is possible to query the LLM only during the training phase, enabling agents to operate within the environment without any LLM intervention. We assess the performance of this proposed framework by evaluating three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) eliciting subgoals across various procedurally generated environment of the MiniGrid benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that this curriculum-based approach accelerates learning and enhances exploration in complex tasks, achieving up to 30 to 200 times faster convergence in training steps compared to recent baselines designed for sparse reward environments.</description>

      <title>Public Transport Network Design for Equality of Accessibility via Message Passing Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing Public Transport (PT) networks able to satisfy mobility needs of people is essential to reduce the number of individual vehicles on the road, and thus pollution and congestion. Urban sustainability is thus tightly coupled to an efficient PT. Current approaches on Transport Network Design (TND) generally aim to optimize generalized cost, i.e., a unique number including operator and users' costs. Since we intend quality of PT as the capability of satisfying mobility needs, we focus instead on PT accessibility, i.e., the ease of reaching surrounding points of interest via PT. PT accessibility is generally unequally distributed in urban regions: suburbs generally suffer from poor PT accessibility, which condemns residents therein to be dependent on their private cars. We thus tackle the problem of designing bus lines so as to minimize the inequality in the geographical distribution of accessibility. We combine state-of-the-art Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Reinforcement Learning. We show the efficacy of our method against metaheuristics (classically used in TND) in a use case representing in simplified terms the city of Montreal.</description>

      <title>Online design of dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a network (e.g., a telecommunication or transport network) is mainly done offline, in a planning phase, prior to the operation of the network. On the other hand, a massive effort has been devoted to characterizing dynamic networks, i.e., those that evolve over time. The novelty of this paper is that we introduce a method for the online design of dynamic networks. The need to do so emerges when a network needs to operate in a dynamic and stochastic environment. In this case, one may wish to build a network over time, on the fly, in order to react to the changes of the environment and to keep certain performance targets. We tackle this online design problem with a rolling horizon optimization based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. The potential of online network design is showcased for the design of a futuristic dynamic public transport network, where bus lines are constructed on the fly to better adapt to a stochastic user demand. In such a scenario, we compare our results with state-of-the-art dynamic vehicle routing problem (VRP) resolution methods, simulating requests from a New York City taxi dataset. Differently from classic VRP methods, that extend vehicle trajectories in isolation, our method enables us to build a structured network of line buses, where complex user journeys are possible, thus increasing system performance.</description>

      <title>Transferable Belief Model on Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An Uncertainty Aware Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been successfully coupled with Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate their hallucinations and enhance their reasoning capability, such as in KG-based retrieval-augmented frameworks. However, current KG-LLM frameworks lack rigorous uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications. Directly incorporating uncertainty quantification into KG-LLM frameworks presents challenges due to their complex architectures and the intricate interactions between the knowledge graph and language model components. To address this gap, we propose a new trustworthy KG-LLM framework, Uncertainty Aware Knowledge-Graph Reasoning (UAG), which incorporates uncertainty quantification into the KG-LLM framework. We design an uncertainty-aware multi-step reasoning framework that leverages conformal prediction to provide a theoretical guarantee on the prediction set. To manage the error rate of the multi-step process, we additionally introduce an error rate control module to adjust the error rate within the individual components. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UAG can achieve any pre-defined coverage rate while reducing the prediction set/interval size by 40% on average over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Myopia: Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data through Holistic Predictive Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning binary classifiers from positive and unlabeled data (PUL) is vital in many real-world applications, especially when verifying negative examples is difficult. Despite the impressive empirical performance of recent PUL methods, challenges like accumulated errors and increased estimation bias persist due to the absence of negative labels. In this paper, we unveil an intriguing yet long-overlooked observation in PUL: \textit{resampling the positive data in each training iteration to ensure a balanced distribution between positive and unlabeled examples results in strong early-stage performance. Furthermore, predictive trends for positive and negative classes display distinctly different patterns.} Specifically, the scores (output probability) of unlabeled negative examples consistently decrease, while those of unlabeled positive examples show largely chaotic trends. Instead of focusing on classification within individual time frames, we innovatively adopt a holistic approach, interpreting the scores of each example as a temporal point process (TPP). This reformulates the core problem of PUL as recognizing trends in these scores. We then propose a novel TPP-inspired measure for trend detection and prove its asymptotic unbiasedness in predicting changes. Notably, our method accomplishes PUL without requiring additional parameter tuning or prior assumptions, offering an alternative perspective for tackling this problem. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of our method, particularly in a highly imbalanced real-world setting, where it achieves improvements of up to $11.3\%$ in key metrics.

      <title>Editing Massive Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models suffer from the risk of generating outdated, copyrighted, incorrect, and biased content. While previous methods have mitigated the issues on a small scale, it is essential to handle them simultaneously in larger-scale real-world scenarios. We propose a two-stage method, Editing Massive Concepts In Diffusion Models (EMCID). The first stage performs memory optimization for each individual concept with dual self-distillation from text alignment loss and diffusion noise prediction loss. The second stage conducts massive concept editing with multi-layer, closed form model editing. We further propose a comprehensive benchmark, named ImageNet Concept Editing Benchmark (ICEB), for evaluating massive concept editing for T2I models with two subtasks, free-form prompts, massive concept categories, and extensive evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on our proposed benchmark and previous benchmarks demonstrate the superior scalability of EMCID for editing up to 1,000 concepts, providing a practical approach for fast adjustment and re-deployment of T2I diffusion models in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Review of Electromagnetic Elimination Methods for low-field portable MRI scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of both conventional and deep learning methods for eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI) in MRI systems. We explore the underlying principles and implementation of traditional analytical and adaptive EMI elimination techniques, as well as cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Through a detailed comparison, the strengths and limitations of each method are highlighted. Recent advancements in active EMI elimination utilizing multiple external EMI receiver coils and analytical techniques are discussed alongside the superior performance of deep learning methods, which leverage neural networks trained on extensive MRI data. While deep learning methods demonstrate significant improvements in EMI suppression, enhancing diagnostic capabilities and accessibility of MRI technology, they also introduce potential security and safety concerns, especially in production and commercial applications. This study underscores the need to address these challenges to fully realize the benefits of deep learning in EMI elimination. The findings suggest a balanced approach, combining the reliability of conventional methods with the advanced capabilities of deep learning, to develop more robust and effective EMI suppression strategies in MRI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Transferable Features for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have demonstrated success in a variety of applications, including inverse problems and neural rendering. An INR is typically trained to capture one signal of interest, resulting in learned neural features that are highly attuned to that signal. Assumed to be less generalizable, we explore the aspect of transferability of such learned neural features for fitting similar signals. We introduce a new INR training framework, STRAINER that learns transferrable features for fitting INRs to new signals from a given distribution, faster and with better reconstruction quality. Owing to the sequential layer-wise affine operations in an INR, we propose to learn transferable representations by sharing initial encoder layers across multiple INRs with independent decoder layers. At test time, the learned encoder representations are transferred as initialization for an otherwise randomly initialized INR. We find STRAINER to yield extremely powerful initialization for fitting images from the same domain and allow for $\approx +10dB$ gain in signal quality early on compared to an untrained INR itself. STRAINER also provides a simple way to encode data-driven priors in INRs. We evaluate STRAINER on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain signal fitting tasks and inverse problems and further provide detailed analysis and discussion on the transferability of STRAINER's features.

      <title>An undetectable watermark for generative image models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/PRC-Watermark.</description>

      <title>Embedding an ANN-Based Crystal Plasticity Model into the Finite Element Framework using an ABAQUS User-Material Subroutine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a practical method for incorporating trained Neural Networks (NNs) into the Finite Element (FE) framework using a user material (UMAT) subroutine. The work exemplifies crystal plasticity, a complex inelastic non-linear path-dependent material response, with a wide range of applications in ABAQUS UMAT. However, this approach can be extended to other material behaviors and FE tools. The use of a UMAT subroutine serves two main purposes: (1) it predicts and updates the stress or other mechanical properties of interest directly from the strain history; (2) it computes the Jacobian matrix either through backpropagation or numerical differentiation, which plays an essential role in the solution convergence. By implementing NNs in a UMAT subroutine, a trained machine learning model can be employed as a data-driven constitutive law within the FEM framework, preserving multiscale information that conventional constitutive laws often neglect or average. The versatility of this method makes it a powerful tool for integrating machine learning into mechanical simulation. While this approach is expected to provide higher accuracy in reproducing realistic material behavior, the reliability of the solution process and the convergence conditions must be paid special attention. While the theory of the model is explained in [Heider et al. 2020], exemplary source code is also made available for interested readers [https://doi.org/10.25835/6n5uu50y]</description>

      <title>New technologies and AI: envisioning future directions for UNSCR 1540</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emerging challenges posed by the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the military domain, particularly within the context of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (UNSCR 1540), which seeks to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). While the resolution initially focused on nuclear, chemical, and biological threats, the rapid advancement of AI introduces new complexities that were previously unanticipated. We critically analyze how AI can both exacerbate existing risks associated with WMDs (e.g., thorough the deployment of kamikaze drones and killer robots) and introduce novel threats (e.g., by exploiting Generative AI potentialities), thereby compromising international peace and security. The paper calls for an expansion of UNSCR 1540 to address the growing influence of AI technologies in the development, dissemination, and potential misuse of WMDs, urging the creation of a governance framework to mitigate these emerging risks.</description>

      <title>LecPrompt: A Prompt-based Approach for Logical Error Correction with CodeBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logical errors in programming don't raise compiler alerts, making them hard to detect. These silent errors can disrupt a program's function or cause run-time issues. Their correction requires deep insight into the program's logic, highlighting the importance of automated detection and repair. In this paper, we introduce LecPrompt to localize and repair logical errors, an prompt-based approach that harnesses the capabilities of CodeBERT, a transformer-based large language model trained on code. First, LecPrompt leverages a large language model to calculate perplexity and log probability metrics, pinpointing logical errors at both token and line levels. Through statistical analysis, it identifies tokens and lines that deviate significantly from the expected patterns recognized by large language models, marking them as potential error sources. Second, by framing the logical error correction challenge as a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task, LecPrompt employs CodeBERT to autoregressively repair the identified error tokens. Finally, the soft-prompt method provides a novel solution in low-cost scenarios, ensuring that the model can be fine-tuned to the specific nuances of the logical error correction task without incurring high computational costs. To evaluate LecPrompt's performance, we created a method to introduce logical errors into correct code and applying this on QuixBugs to produce the QuixBugs-LE dataset. Our evaluations on the QuixBugs-LE dataset for both Python and Java highlight the impressive capabilities of our method, LecPrompt. For Python, LecPrompt achieves a noteworthy 74.58% top-1 token-level repair accuracy and 27.4% program-level repair accuracy. In Java, LecPrompt delivers a 69.23\% top-1 token-level repair accuracy and 24.7% full program-level repair accuracy.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention Mechanism in Multimodal Context for Banking Transaction Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banking Transaction Flow (BTF) is a sequential data found in a number of banking activities such as marketing, credit risk or banking fraud. It is a multimodal data composed of three modalities: a date, a numerical value and a wording. We propose in this work an application of self-attention mechanism to the processing of BTFs. We trained two general models on a large amount of BTFs in a self-supervised way: one RNN-based model and one Transformer-based model. We proposed a specific tokenization in order to be able to process BTFs. The performance of these two models was evaluated on two banking downstream tasks: a transaction categorization task and a credit risk task. The results show that fine-tuning these two pre-trained models allowed to perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches for both tasks.</description>

      <title>RAB$^2$-DEF: Dynamic and explainable defense against adversarial attacks in Federated Learning to fair poor clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the same time that artificial intelligence is becoming popular, concern and the need for regulation is growing, including among other requirements the data privacy. In this context, Federated Learning is proposed as a solution to data privacy concerns derived from different source data scenarios due to its distributed learning. The defense mechanisms proposed in literature are just focused on defending against adversarial attacks and the performance, leaving aside other important qualities such as explainability, fairness to poor quality clients, dynamism in terms of attacks configuration and generality in terms of being resilient against different kinds of attacks. In this work, we propose RAB$^2$-DEF, a $\textbf{r}$esilient $\textbf{a}$gainst $\textbf{b}\text{yzantine}$ and $\textbf{b}$ackdoor attacks which is $\textbf{d}$ynamic, $\textbf{e}$xplainable and $\textbf{f}$air to poor clients using local linear explanations. We test the performance of RAB$^2$-DEF in image datasets and both byzantine and backdoor attacks considering the state-of-the-art defenses and achieve that RAB$^2$-DEF is a proper defense at the same time that it boosts the other qualities towards trustworthy artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Flex-MoE: Modeling Arbitrary Modality Combination via the Flexible Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained increasing importance across various fields, offering the ability to integrate data from diverse sources such as images, text, and personalized records, which are frequently observed in medical domains. However, in scenarios where some modalities are missing, many existing frameworks struggle to accommodate arbitrary modality combinations, often relying heavily on a single modality or complete data. This oversight of potential modality combinations limits their applicability in real-world situations. To address this challenge, we propose Flex-MoE (Flexible Mixture-of-Experts), a new framework designed to flexibly incorporate arbitrary modality combinations while maintaining robustness to missing data. The core idea of Flex-MoE is to first address missing modalities using a new missing modality bank that integrates observed modality combinations with the corresponding missing ones. This is followed by a uniquely designed Sparse MoE framework. Specifically, Flex-MoE first trains experts using samples with all modalities to inject generalized knowledge through the generalized router ($\mathcal{G}$-Router). The $\mathcal{S}$-Router then specializes in handling fewer modality combinations by assigning the top-1 gate to the expert corresponding to the observed modality combination. We evaluate Flex-MoE on the ADNI dataset, which encompasses four modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease domain, as well as on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Flex-MoE highlighting its ability to model arbitrary modality combinations in diverse missing modality scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flex-moe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency department (ED) crowding is a global public health issue that has been repeatedly associated with increased mortality. Predicting future service demand would enable preventative measures aiming to eliminate crowding along with it's detrimental effects. Recent findings in our ED indicate that occupancy ratios exceeding 90% are associated with increased 10-day mortality. In this paper, we aim to predict these crisis periods using retrospective data from a large Nordic ED with a LightGBM model. We provide predictions for the whole ED and individually for it's different operational sections. We demonstrate that afternoon crowding can be predicted at 11 a.m. with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86) and at 8 a.m. with an AUC up to 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.83). Consequently we show that forecasting mortality-associated crowding using anonymous administrative data is feasible.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Learning for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) offers a promising solution to the data sparsity problem by enabling knowledge transfer across source and target domains. However, many recent CDR models overlook crucial issues such as privacy as well as the risk of negative transfer (which negatively impact model performance), especially in multi-domain settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedGCDR, a novel federated graph learning framework that securely and effectively leverages positive knowledge from multiple source domains. First, we design a positive knowledge transfer module that ensures privacy during inter-domain knowledge transmission. This module employs differential privacy-based knowledge extraction combined with a feature mapping mechanism, transforming source domain embeddings from federated graph attention networks into reliable domain knowledge. Second, we design a knowledge activation module to filter out potential harmful or conflicting knowledge from source domains, addressing the issues of negative transfer. This module enhances target domain training by expanding the graph of the target domain to generate reliable domain attentions and fine-tunes the target model for improved negative knowledge filtering and more accurate predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 popular domains of the Amazon dataset, demonstrating that FedGCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of SSL and ASR technologies, the Wav2Vec2 ASR-based model has been fine-tuned for automated speech disorder quality assessment tasks, yielding impressive results and setting a new baseline for Head and Neck Cancer speech contexts. This demonstrates that the ASR dimension from Wav2Vec2 closely aligns with assessment dimensions. Despite its effectiveness, this system remains a black box with no clear interpretation of the connection between the model ASR dimension and clinical assessments. This paper presents the first analysis of this baseline model for speech quality assessment, focusing on intelligibility and severity tasks. We conduct a layer-wise analysis to identify key layers and compare different SSL and ASR Wav2Vec2 models based on pre-trained data. Additionally, post-hoc XAI methods, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and visualization techniques, are used to track model evolution and visualize embeddings for enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by interpretability and reliability, we investigate how neural networks represent knowledge during graph learning, We find hints of universality, where equivalent representations are learned across a range of model sizes (from $10^2$ to $10^9$ parameters) and contexts (MLP toy models, LLM in-context learning and LLM training). We show that these attractor representations optimize generalization to unseen examples by exploiting properties of knowledge graph relations (e.g. symmetry and meta-transitivity). We find experimental support for such universality by showing that LLMs and simpler neural networks can be stitched, i.e., by stitching the first part of one model to the last part of another, mediated only by an affine or almost affine transformation. We hypothesize that this dynamic toward simplicity and generalization is driven by "intelligence from starvation": where overfitting is minimized by pressure to minimize the use of resources that are either scarce or competed for against other tasks.</description>

      <title>AdaShadow: Responsive Test-time Model Adaptation in Non-stationary Mobile Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device adapting to continual, unpredictable domain shifts is essential for mobile applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality to deliver seamless user experiences in evolving environments. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a promising solution by tuning model parameters with unlabeled live data immediately before prediction. However, TTA's unique forward-backward-reforward pipeline notably increases the latency over standard inference, undermining the responsiveness in time-sensitive mobile applications. This paper presents AdaShadow, a responsive test-time adaptation framework for non-stationary mobile data distribution and resource dynamics via selective updates of adaptation-critical layers. Although the tactic is recognized in generic on-device training, TTA's unsupervised and online context presents unique challenges in estimating layer importance and latency, as well as scheduling the optimal layer update plan. AdaShadow addresses these challenges with a backpropagation-free assessor to rapidly identify critical layers, a unit-based runtime predictor to account for resource dynamics in latency estimation, and an online scheduler for prompt layer update planning. Also, AdaShadow incorporates a memory I/O-aware computation reuse scheme to further reduce latency in the reforward pass. Results show that AdaShadow achieves the best accuracy-latency balance under continual shifts. At low memory and energy costs, Adashadow provides a 2x to 3.5x speedup (ms-level) over state-of-the-art TTA methods with comparable accuracy and a 14.8% to 25.4% accuracy boost over efficient supervised methods with similar latency.</description>

      <title>Koala-36M: A Large-scale Video Dataset Improving Consistency between Fine-grained Conditions and Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As visual generation technologies continue to advance, the scale of video datasets has expanded rapidly, and the quality of these datasets is critical to the performance of video generation models. We argue that temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering are three key factors that determine dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The core of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset. Our dataset and code will be released at https://koala36m.github.io/.</description>

      <title>FusionSense: Bridging Common Sense, Vision, and Touch for Robust Sparse-View Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans effortlessly integrate common-sense knowledge with sensory input from vision and touch to understand their surroundings. Emulating this capability, we introduce FusionSense, a novel 3D reconstruction framework that enables robots to fuse priors from foundation models with highly sparse observations from vision and tactile sensors. FusionSense addresses three key challenges: (i) How can robots efficiently acquire robust global shape information about the surrounding scene and objects? (ii) How can robots strategically select touch points on the object using geometric and common-sense priors? (iii) How can partial observations such as tactile signals improve the overall representation of the object? Our framework employs 3D Gaussian Splatting as a core representation and incorporates a hierarchical optimization strategy involving global structure construction, object visual hull pruning and local geometric constraints. This advancement results in fast and robust perception in environments with traditionally challenging objects that are transparent, reflective, or dark, enabling more downstream manipulation or navigation tasks. Experiments on real-world data suggest that our framework outperforms previously state-of-the-art sparse-view methods. All code and data are open-sourced on the project website.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Difficulty of Automatically Generated Questions via Reinforcement Learning with Synthetic Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the cultural heritage sector increasingly adopts technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide more personalised search experiences and enable conversations with collections data, the demand for specialised evaluation datasets has grown. While end-to-end system testing is essential, it's equally important to assess individual components. We target the final, answering task, which is well-suited to Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Although existing MRC datasets address general domains, they lack the specificity needed for cultural heritage information. Unfortunately, the manual creation of such datasets is prohibitively expensive for most heritage institutions. This paper presents a cost-effective approach for generating domain-specific MRC datasets with increased difficulty using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from synthetic preference data. Our method leverages the performance of existing question-answering models on a subset of SQuAD to create a difficulty metric, assuming that more challenging questions are answered correctly less frequently. This research contributes: (1) A methodology for increasing question difficulty using PPO and synthetic data; (2) Empirical evidence of the method's effectiveness, including human evaluation; (3) An in-depth error analysis and study of emergent phenomena; and (4) An open-source codebase and set of three llama-2-chat adapters for reproducibility and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Can Looped Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent for In-context Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capability of Transformers to do reasoning and few-shot learning, without any fine-tuning, is widely conjectured to stem from their ability to implicitly simulate a multi-step algorithms -- such as gradient descent -- with their weights in a single forward pass. Recently, there has been progress in understanding this complex phenomenon from an expressivity point of view, by demonstrating that Transformers can express such multi-step algorithms. However, our knowledge about the more fundamental aspect of its learnability, beyond single layer models, is very limited. In particular, can training Transformers enable convergence to algorithmic solutions? In this work we resolve this for in-context linear regression with linear looped Transformers -- a multi-layer model with weight sharing that is conjectured to have an inductive bias to learn fix-point iterative algorithms. More specifically, for this setting we show that the global minimizer of the population training loss implements multi-step preconditioned gradient descent, with a preconditioner that adapts to the data distribution. Furthermore, we show a fast convergence for gradient flow on the regression loss, despite the non-convexity of the landscape, by proving a novel gradient dominance condition. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis for multi-layer Transformer in this setting. We further validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.</description>

      <title>UNIQ: Offline Inverse Q-learning for Avoiding Undesirable Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of offline learning a policy that avoids undesirable demonstrations. Unlike conventional offline imitation learning approaches that aim to imitate expert or near-optimal demonstrations, our setting involves avoiding undesirable behavior (specified using undesirable demonstrations). To tackle this problem, unlike standard imitation learning where the aim is to minimize the distance between learning policy and expert demonstrations, we formulate the learning task as maximizing a statistical distance, in the space of state-action stationary distributions, between the learning policy and the undesirable policy. This significantly different approach results in a novel training objective that necessitates a new algorithm to address it. Our algorithm, UNIQ, tackles these challenges by building on the inverse Q-learning framework, framing the learning problem as a cooperative (non-adversarial) task. We then demonstrate how to efficiently leverage unlabeled data for practical training. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmark environments, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>Level of agreement between emotions generated by Artificial Intelligence and human evaluation: a methodological proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images are capable of conveying emotions, but emotional experience is highly subjective. Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the generation of images based on emotional descriptions. However, the level of agreement between the generative images and human emotional responses has not yet been evaluated. To address this, 20 artistic landscapes were generated using StyleGAN2-ADA. Four variants evoking positive emotions (contentment, amusement) and negative emotions (fear, sadness) were created for each image, resulting in 80 pictures. An online questionnaire was designed using this material, in which 61 observers classified the generated images. Statistical analyses were performed on the collected data to determine the level of agreement among participants, between the observer's responses, and the AI-generated emotions. A generally good level of agreement was found, with better results for negative emotions. However, the study confirms the subjectivity inherent in emotional evaluation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Natural Language-Based Strategies for Efficient Number Learning in Children through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how children learn numbers using the framework of reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on the impact of language instructions. The motivation for using reinforcement learning stems from its parallels with psychological learning theories in controlled environments. By using state of the art deep reinforcement learning models, we simulate and analyze the effects of various forms of language instructions on number acquisition. Our findings indicate that certain linguistic structures more effectively improve numerical comprehension in RL agents. Additionally, our model predicts optimal sequences for presenting numbers to RL agents which enhance their speed of learning. This research provides valuable insights into the interplay between language and numerical cognition, with implications for both educational strategies and the development of artificial intelligence systems designed to support early childhood learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By merging models, AI systems can combine the distinct strengths of separate language models, achieving a balance between multiple capabilities without requiring substantial retraining. However, the integration process can be intricate due to differences in training methods and fine-tuning, typically necessitating specialized knowledge and repeated refinement. This paper explores model merging techniques across a spectrum of complexity, examining where automated methods like evolutionary strategies stand compared to hyperparameter-driven approaches such as DARE, TIES-Merging and simpler methods like Model Soups. In addition, we introduce Differentiable Adaptive Merging (DAM), an efficient, adaptive merging approach as an alternative to evolutionary merging that optimizes model integration through scaling coefficients, minimizing computational demands. Our findings reveal that even simple averaging methods, like Model Soups, perform competitively when model similarity is high, underscoring each technique's unique strengths and limitations. We open-sourced DAM, including the implementation code and experiment pipeline, on GitHub: https://github.com/arcee-ai/DAM.</description>

      <title>Language model developers should report train-test overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are extensively evaluated, but correctly interpreting evaluation results requires knowledge of train-test overlap which refers to the extent to which the language model is trained on the very data it is being tested on. The public currently lacks adequate information about train-test overlap: most models have no public train-test overlap statistics, and third parties cannot directly measure train-test overlap since they do not have access to the training data. To make this clear, we document the practices of 30 model developers, finding that just 9 developers report train-test overlap: 4 developers release training data under open-source licenses, enabling the community to directly measure train-test overlap, and 5 developers publish their train-test overlap methodology and statistics. By engaging with language model developers, we provide novel information about train-test overlap for three additional developers. Overall, we take the position that language model developers should publish train-test overlap statistics and/or training data whenever they report evaluation results on public test sets. We hope our work increases transparency into train-test overlap to increase the community-wide trust in model evaluations.</description>

      <title>GUS-Net: Social Bias Classification in Text with Generalizations, Unfairness, and Stereotypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of bias in natural language processing (NLP) is a critical challenge, particularly with the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in various domains. This paper introduces GUS-Net, an innovative approach to bias detection that focuses on three key types of biases: (G)eneralizations, (U)nfairness, and (S)tereotypes. GUS-Net leverages generative AI and automated agents to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset, enabling robust multi-label token classification. Our methodology enhances traditional bias detection methods by incorporating the contextual encodings of pre-trained models, resulting in improved accuracy and depth in identifying biased entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GUS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and Hamming Loss. The findings highlight GUS-Net's effectiveness in capturing a wide range of biases across diverse contexts, making it a valuable tool for social bias detection in text. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts in NLP to address implicit bias, providing a pathway for future research and applications in various fields. The Jupyter notebooks used to create the dataset and model are available at: https://github.com/Ethical-Spectacle/fair-ly/tree/main/resources.

      <title>KnowGraph: Knowledge-Enabled Anomaly Detection via Logical Reasoning on Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based anomaly detection is pivotal in diverse security applications, such as fraud detection in transaction networks and intrusion detection for network traffic. Standard approaches, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), often struggle to generalize across shifting data distributions. Meanwhile, real-world domain knowledge is more stable and a common existing component of real-world detection strategies. To explicitly integrate such knowledge into data-driven models such as GCNs, we propose KnowGraph, which integrates domain knowledge with data-driven learning for enhanced graph-based anomaly detection. KnowGraph comprises two principal components: (1) a statistical learning component that utilizes a main model for the overarching detection task, augmented by multiple specialized knowledge models that predict domain-specific semantic entities; (2) a reasoning component that employs probabilistic graphical models to execute logical inferences based on model outputs, encoding domain knowledge through weighted first-order logic formulas. Extensive experiments on these large-scale real-world datasets show that KnowGraph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving substantial gains in average precision when generalizing to completely unseen test graphs. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reasoning component in improving detection performance, especially under extreme class imbalance. These results highlight the potential of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven models for high-stakes, graph-based security applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .</description>

      <title>The Effects of Hallucinations in Synthetic Training Data for Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relation extraction is crucial for constructing knowledge graphs, with large high-quality datasets serving as the foundation for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models. Generative data augmentation (GDA) is a common approach to expand such datasets. However, this approach often introduces hallucinations, such as spurious facts, whose impact on relation extraction remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effects of hallucinations on the performance of relation extraction on the document and sentence levels. Our empirical study reveals that hallucinations considerably compromise the ability of models to extract relations from text, with recall reductions between 19.1% and 39.2%. We identify that relevant hallucinations impair the model's performance, while irrelevant hallucinations have a minimal impact. Additionally, we develop methods for the detection of hallucinations to improve data quality and model performance. Our approaches successfully classify texts as either 'hallucinated' or 'clean,' achieving high F1-scores of 83.8% and 92.2%. These methods not only assist in removing hallucinations but also help in estimating their prevalence within datasets, which is crucial for selecting high-quality data. Overall, our work confirms the profound impact of relevant hallucinations on the effectiveness of relation extraction models.</description>

      <title>VoxelPrompt: A Vision-Language Agent for Grounded Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VoxelPrompt, an agent-driven vision-language framework that tackles diverse radiological tasks through joint modeling of natural language, image volumes, and analytical metrics. VoxelPrompt is multi-modal and versatile, leveraging the flexibility of language interaction while providing quantitatively grounded image analysis. Given a variable number of 3D medical volumes, such as MRI and CT scans, VoxelPrompt employs a language agent that iteratively predicts executable instructions to solve a task specified by an input prompt. These instructions communicate with a vision network to encode image features and generate volumetric outputs (e.g., segmentations). VoxelPrompt interprets the results of intermediate instructions and plans further actions to compute discrete measures (e.g., tumor growth across a series of scans) and present relevant outputs to the user. We evaluate this framework in a sandbox of diverse neuroimaging tasks, and we show that the single VoxelPrompt model can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure many complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt carries out these objectives with accuracy similar to that of fine-tuned, single-task models for segmentation and visual question-answering, while facilitating a much larger range of tasks. Therefore, by supporting accurate image processing with language interaction, VoxelPrompt provides comprehensive utility for numerous imaging tasks that traditionally require specialized models to address.</description>

      <title>AgroGPT: Efficient Agricultural Vision-Language Model with Expert Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in advancing large multimodal conversational models (LMMs), capitalizing on vast repositories of image-text data available online. Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions. The code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/awaisrauf/agroGPT.</description>

      <title>Promptly Yours? A Human Subject Study on Prompt Inference in AI-Generated Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of AI-generated art has witnessed the rise of prompt marketplaces, where creators can purchase, sell, or share prompts for generating unique artworks. These marketplaces often assert ownership over prompts, claiming them as intellectual property. This paper investigates whether concealed prompts sold on prompt marketplaces can be considered as secure intellectual property, given that humans and AI tools may be able to approximately infer the prompts based on publicly advertised sample images accompanying each prompt on sale. Specifically, our survey aims to assess (i) how accurately can humans infer the original prompt solely by examining an AI-generated image, with the goal of generating images similar to the original image, and (ii) the possibility of improving upon individual human and AI prompt inferences by crafting human-AI combined prompts with the help of a large language model. Although previous research has explored the use of AI and machine learning to infer (and also protect against) prompt inference, we are the first to include humans in the loop. Our findings indicate that while humans and human-AI collaborations can infer prompts and generate similar images with high accuracy, they are not as successful as using the original prompt.</description>

      <title>oRetrieval Augmented Generation for 10 Large Language Models and its Generalizability in Assessing Medical Fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for medical applications but often lack specialized clinical knowledge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows customization with domain-specific information, making it suitable for healthcare. This study evaluates the accuracy, consistency, and safety of RAG models in determining fitness for surgery and providing preoperative instructions. We developed LLM-RAG models using 35 local and 23 international preoperative guidelines and tested them against human-generated responses. A total of 3,682 responses were evaluated. Clinical documents were processed using Llamaindex, and 10 LLMs, including GPT3.5, GPT4, and Claude-3, were assessed. Fourteen clinical scenarios were analyzed, focusing on seven aspects of preoperative instructions. Established guidelines and expert judgment were used to determine correct responses, with human-generated answers serving as comparisons. The LLM-RAG models generated responses within 20 seconds, significantly faster than clinicians (10 minutes). The GPT4 LLM-RAG model achieved the highest accuracy (96.4% vs. 86.6%, p=0.016), with no hallucinations and producing correct instructions comparable to clinicians. Results were consistent across both local and international guidelines. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-RAG models for preoperative healthcare tasks, highlighting their efficiency, scalability, and reliability.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Music Generation with Fine-grained Interactive Textural Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of symbolic music generation presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce Fine-grained Textural Guidance (FTG) within diffusion models to correct errors in the learned distributions. By incorporating FTG, the diffusion models improve the accuracy of music generation, which makes them well-suited for advanced tasks such as progressive music generation, improvisation and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effect of the FTG approach. We provide numerical experiments and a demo page for interactive music generation with user input to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When performing complex multi-step reasoning tasks, the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive structured intermediate proof steps is important for ensuring that the models truly perform the desired reasoning and for improving models' explainability. This paper is centred around a focused study: whether the current state-of-the-art generalist LLMs can leverage the structures in a few examples to better construct the proof structures with \textit{in-context learning}. Our study specifically focuses on structure-aware demonstration and structure-aware pruning. We demonstrate that they both help improve performance. A detailed analysis is provided to help understand the results.</description>

      <title>JurEE not Judges: safeguarding llm interactions with small, specialised Encoder Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce JurEE, an ensemble of efficient, encoder-only transformer models designed to strengthen safeguards in AI-User interactions within LLM-based systems. Unlike existing LLM-as-Judge methods, which often struggle with generalization across risk taxonomies and only provide textual outputs, JurEE offers probabilistic risk estimates across a wide range of prevalent risks. Our approach leverages diverse data sources and employs progressive synthetic data generation techniques, including LLM-assisted augmentation, to enhance model robustness and performance. We create an in-house benchmark comprising of other reputable benchmarks such as the OpenAI Moderation Dataset and ToxicChat, where we find JurEE significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating superior accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency. This makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring stringent content moderation, such as customer-facing chatbots. The encoder-ensemble's modular design allows users to set tailored risk thresholds, enhancing its versatility across various safety-related applications. JurEE's collective decision-making process, where each specialized encoder model contributes to the final output, not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances interpretability. This approach provides a more efficient, performant, and economical alternative to traditional LLMs for large-scale implementations requiring robust content moderation.</description>

      <title>Why pre-training is beneficial for downstream classification tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training has exhibited notable benefits to downstream tasks by boosting accuracy and speeding up convergence, but the exact reasons for these benefits still remain unclear. To this end, we propose to quantitatively and explicitly explain effects of pre-training on the downstream task from a novel game-theoretic view, which also sheds new light into the learning behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we extract and quantify the knowledge encoded by the pre-trained model, and further track the changes of such knowledge during the fine-tuning process. Interestingly, we discover that only a small amount of pre-trained model's knowledge is preserved for the inference of downstream tasks. However, such preserved knowledge is very challenging for a model training from scratch to learn. Thus, with the help of this exclusively learned and useful knowledge, the model fine-tuned from pre-training usually achieves better performance than the model training from scratch. Besides, we discover that pre-training can guide the fine-tuned model to learn target knowledge for the downstream task more directly and quickly, which accounts for the faster convergence of the fine-tuned model.</description>

      <title>ARCap: Collecting High-quality Human Demonstrations for Robot Learning with Augmented Reality Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in imitation learning from human demonstrations has shown promising results in teaching robots manipulation skills. To further scale up training datasets, recent works start to use portable data collection devices without the need for physical robot hardware. However, due to the absence of on-robot feedback during data collection, the data quality depends heavily on user expertise, and many devices are limited to specific robot embodiments. We propose ARCap, a portable data collection system that provides visual feedback through augmented reality (AR) and haptic warnings to guide users in collecting high-quality demonstrations. Through extensive user studies, we show that ARCap enables novice users to collect robot-executable data that matches robot kinematics and avoids collisions with the scenes. With data collected from ARCap, robots can perform challenging tasks, such as manipulation in cluttered environments and long-horizon cross-embodiment manipulation. ARCap is fully open-source and easy to calibrate; all components are built from off-the-shelf products. More details and results can be found on our website: https://stanford-tml.github.io/ARCap</description>

      <title>Deeper Insights into Deep Graph Convolutional Networks: Stability and Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful models for graph learning tasks, exhibiting promising performance in various domains. While their empirical success is evident, there is a growing need to understand their essential ability from a theoretical perspective. Existing theoretical research has primarily focused on the analysis of single-layer GCNs, while a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the stability and generalization of deep GCNs remains limited. In this paper, we bridge this gap by delving into the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, aiming to provide valuable insights by characterizing rigorously the associated upper bounds. Our theoretical results reveal that the stability and generalization of deep GCNs are influenced by certain key factors, such as the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the graph filter operators and the depth of the network. Our theoretical studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, potentially paving the way for developing more reliable and well-performing models.</description>

      <title>Personalized Item Embeddings in Federated Multimodal Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated recommendation systems play a crucial role in protecting user privacy. However, existing methods primarily rely on ID-based item embeddings, overlooking the rich multimodal information of items. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Federated Multimodal Recommendation System called FedMR. FedMR leverages a foundation model on the server side to encode multimodal data, such as images and text, associated with items. To tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity caused by varying user preferences, FedMR introduces a Mixing Feature Fusion Module on the client. This module dynamically adjusts the weights of different fusion strategies based on user interaction history, generating personalized item embeddings that capture fine-grained user preferences. FedMR is compatible with existing ID-based federated recommendation systems, improving their performances without modifying the original framework. Our experiments on four real-world multimodal recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMR. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedMR.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Edge Case Detection in Automated Driving: Methods, Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs) promises to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety and efficiency. However, ensuring their reliability in diverse real-world conditions remains a significant challenge, particularly due to rare and unexpected situations known as edge cases. Although numerous approaches exist for detecting edge cases, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews these techniques. This paper fills this gap by presenting a practical, hierarchical review and systematic classification of edge case detection and assessment methodologies. Our classification is structured on two levels: first, categorizing detection approaches according to AV modules, including perception-related and trajectory-related edge cases; and second, based on underlying methodologies and theories guiding these techniques. We extend this taxonomy by introducing a new class called "knowledge-driven" approaches, which is largely overlooked in the literature. Additionally, we review the techniques and metrics for the evaluation of edge case detection methods and identified edge cases. To our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively cover edge case detection methods across all AV subsystems, discuss knowledge-driven edge cases, and explore evaluation techniques for detection methods. This structured and multi-faceted analysis aims to facilitate targeted research and modular testing of AVs. Moreover, by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches and discussing the challenges and future directions, this survey intends to assist AV developers, researchers, and policymakers in enhancing the safety and reliability of automated driving (AD) systems through effective edge case detection.</description>

      <title>Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation via Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation Guided LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural language instructions and visual cues. It remains challenging due to the complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction. Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further, this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction. Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have successfully proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving 15.9% and 12.5% improvements (absolute) in Oracle Success Rate (OSR) on AerialVLN-S dataset.</description>

      <title>"I Am the One and Only, Your Cyber BFF": Understanding the Impact of GenAI Requires Understanding the Impact of Anthropomorphic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art generative AI (GenAI) systems are increasingly prone to anthropomorphic behaviors, i.e., to generating outputs that are perceived to be human-like. While this has led to scholars increasingly raising concerns about possible negative impacts such anthropomorphic AI systems can give rise to, anthropomorphism in AI development, deployment, and use remains vastly overlooked, understudied, and underspecified. In this perspective, we argue that we cannot thoroughly map the social impacts of generative AI without mapping the social impacts of anthropomorphic AI, and outline a call to action.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Predicting Downstream Performance in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance after the critical "emergent phase". In preliminary experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. This motivates FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training, specifically blending general corpora with code data to accurately represent the common necessity. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.</description>

      <title>VOVTrack: Exploring the Potentiality in Videos for Open-Vocabulary Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary multi-object tracking (OVMOT) represents a critical new challenge involving the detection and tracking of diverse object categories in videos, encompassing both seen categories (base classes) and unseen categories (novel classes). This issue amalgamates the complexities of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) and multi-object tracking (MOT). Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, predominantly focusing on the problem through an image-centric lens. In this paper, we propose VOVTrack, a novel method that integrates object states relevant to MOT and video-centric training to address this challenge from a video object tracking standpoint. First, we consider the tracking-related state of the objects during tracking and propose a new prompt-guided attention mechanism for more accurate localization and classification (detection) of the time-varying objects. Subsequently, we leverage raw video data without annotations for training by formulating a self-supervised object similarity learning technique to facilitate temporal object association (tracking). Experimental results underscore that VOVTrack outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary tracking task.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope: Learnable Masks for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), parameter sharing is commonly employed to enhance sample efficiency. However, the popular approach of full parameter sharing often leads to homogeneous policies among agents, potentially limiting the performance benefits that could be derived from policy diversity. To address this critical limitation, we introduce \emph{Kaleidoscope}, a novel adaptive partial parameter sharing scheme that fosters policy heterogeneity while still maintaining high sample efficiency. Specifically, Kaleidoscope maintains one set of common parameters alongside multiple sets of distinct, learnable masks for different agents, dictating the sharing of parameters. It promotes diversity among policy networks by encouraging discrepancy among these masks, without sacrificing the efficiencies of parameter sharing. This design allows Kaleidoscope to dynamically balance high sample efficiency with a broad policy representational capacity, effectively bridging the gap between full parameter sharing and non-parameter sharing across various environments. We further extend Kaleidoscope to critic ensembles in the context of actor-critic algorithms, which could help improve value estimations.Our empirical evaluations across extensive environments, including multi-agent particle environment, multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft multi-agent challenge v2, demonstrate the superior performance of Kaleidoscope compared with existing parameter sharing approaches, showcasing its potential for performance enhancement in MARL. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/LXXXXR/Kaleidoscope}.</description>

      <title>Humanity in AI: Detecting the Personality of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Questionnaires are a common method for detecting the personality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their reliability is often compromised by two main issues: hallucinations (where LLMs produce inaccurate or irrelevant responses) and the sensitivity of responses to the order of the presented options. To address these issues, we propose combining text mining with questionnaires method. Text mining can extract psychological features from the LLMs' responses without being affected by the order of options. Furthermore, because this method does not rely on specific answers, it reduces the influence of hallucinations. By normalizing the scores from both methods and calculating the root mean square error, our experiment results confirm the effectiveness of this approach. To further investigate the origins of personality traits in LLMs, we conduct experiments on both pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT, as well as conversational models (ChatLLMs), such as ChatGPT. The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, ChatGPT and ChatGLM exhibit the personality traits of 'Conscientiousness'. Additionally, we find that the personalities of LLMs are derived from their pre-trained data. The instruction data used to train ChatLLMs can enhance the generation of data containing personalities and expose their hidden personality. We compare the results with the human average personality score, and we find that the personality of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Full Body Anonymization using Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.</description>

      <title>Balancing Innovation and Privacy: Data Security Strategies in Natural Language Processing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses privacy protection in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a novel algorithm based on differential privacy, aimed at safeguarding user data in common applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. With the widespread application of NLP technology, the security and privacy protection of user data have become important issues that need to be solved urgently. This paper proposes a new privacy protection algorithm designed to effectively prevent the leakage of user sensitive information. By introducing a differential privacy mechanism, our model ensures the accuracy and reliability of data analysis results while adding random noise. This method not only reduces the risk caused by data leakage but also achieves effective processing of data while protecting user privacy. Compared to traditional privacy methods like data anonymization and homomorphic encryption, our approach offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability while maintaining high accuracy in data analysis. The proposed algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated through performance metrics such as accuracy (0.89), precision (0.85), and recall (0.88), outperforming other methods in balancing privacy and utility. As privacy protection regulations become increasingly stringent, enterprises and developers must take effective measures to deal with privacy risks. Our research provides an important reference for the application of privacy protection technology in the field of NLP, emphasizing the need to achieve a balance between technological innovation and user privacy. In the future, with the continuous advancement of technology, privacy protection will become a core element of data-driven applications and promote the healthy development of the entire industry.</description>

      <title>Learning General Representation of 12-Lead Electrocardiogram with a Joint-Embedding Predictive architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, named ECG Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (ECG-JEPA). ECG-JEPA employs a masking strategy to learn semantic representations of ECG data. Unlike existing methods, ECG-JEPA predicts at the hidden representation level rather than reconstructing raw data. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in standard ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of a special masked attention tailored for 12-lead ECG data, Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA). CroPA enables the model to effectively capture inter-patch relationships. Additionally, ECG-JEPA is highly scalable, allowing efficient training on large datasets. Our code is openly available https://github.com/sehunfromdaegu/ECG_JEPA.</description>

      <title>Integrating AI for Enhanced Feedback in Translation Revision- A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Student Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the well-established importance of feedback in education, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated feedback, particularly from language models like ChatGPT, remains understudied in translation education. This study investigates the engagement of master's students in translation with ChatGPT-generated feedback during their revision process. A mixed-methods approach, combining a translation-and-revision experiment with quantitative and qualitative analyses, was employed to examine the feedback, translations pre-and post-revision, the revision process, and student reflections. The results reveal complex interrelations among cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions influencing students' engagement with AI feedback and their subsequent revisions. Specifically, the findings indicate that students invested considerable cognitive effort in the revision process, despite finding the feedback comprehensible. Additionally, they exhibited moderate affective satisfaction with the feedback model. Behaviourally, their actions were largely influenced by cognitive and affective factors, although some inconsistencies were observed. This research provides novel insights into the potential applications of AI-generated feedback in translation teachingand opens avenues for further investigation into the integration of AI tools in language teaching settings.</description>

      <title>Intent-Enhanced Data Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research on intent-enhanced sequential recommendation algorithms focuses on how to better mine dynamic user intent based on user behavior data for sequential recommendation tasks. Various data augmentation methods are widely applied in current sequential recommendation algorithms, effectively enhancing the ability to capture user intent. However, these widely used data augmentation methods often rely on a large amount of random sampling, which can introduce excessive noise into the training data, blur user intent, and thus negatively affect recommendation performance. Additionally, these methods have limited approaches to utilizing augmented data, failing to fully leverage the augmented samples. We propose an intent-enhanced data augmentation method for sequential recommendation(\textbf{IESRec}), which constructs positive and negative samples based on user behavior sequences through intent-segment insertion. On one hand, the generated positive samples are mixed with the original training data, and they are trained together to improve recommendation performance. On the other hand, the generated positive and negative samples are used to build a contrastive loss function, enhancing recommendation performance through self-supervised training. Finally, the main recommendation task is jointly trained with the contrastive learning loss minimization task. Experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our IESRec model.</description>

      <title>ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token Sparsification and KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.</description>

Abstract: Automatic medical report generation (MRG), which aims to produce detailed text reports from medical images, has emerged as a critical task in this domain. MRG systems can enhance radiological workflows by reducing the time and effort required for report writing, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency. In this work, we present a novel approach for automatic MRG utilizing a multimodal large language model. Specifically, we employed the 3D Vision Transformer (ViT3D) image encoder introduced from M3D-CLIP to process 3D scans and use the Asclepius-Llama3-8B as the language model to generate the text reports by auto-regressive decoding. The experiment shows our model achieved an average Green score of 0.3 on the MRG task validation set and an average accuracy of 0.61 on the visual question answering (VQA) task validation set, outperforming the baseline model. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the ViT3D alignment of LLaMA3 for automatic MRG and VQA tasks by tuning the model on a small dataset.</description>

Abstract: This work tackles the challenge of efficiently selecting high-performance pre-trained vision backbones for specific target tasks. Although exhaustive search within a finite set of backbones can solve this problem, it becomes impractical for large datasets and backbone pools. To address this, we introduce Vision Backbone Efficient Selection (VIBES), which aims to quickly find well-suited backbones, potentially trading off optimality for efficiency. We propose several simple yet effective heuristics to address VIBES and evaluate them across four diverse computer vision datasets. Our results show that these approaches can identify backbones that outperform those selected from generic benchmarks, even within a limited search budget of one hour on a single GPU. We reckon VIBES marks a paradigm shift from benchmarks to task-specific optimization.</description>

      <title>VERIFIED: A Video Corpus Moment Retrieval Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding, which hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR.

Abstract: Generating realistic images from human texts is one of the most challenging problems in the field of computer vision (CV). The meaning of descriptions given can be roughly reflected by existing text-to-image approaches. In this paper, our main purpose is to propose a brief comparison between five different methods base on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to make image from the text. In addition, each model architectures synthesis images with different resolution. Furthermore, the best and worst obtained resolutions is 64*64, 256*256 respectively. However, we checked and compared some metrics that introduce the accuracy of each model. Also, by doing this study, we found out the best model for this problem by comparing these different approaches essential metrics.</description>

      <title>Conjugated Semantic Pool Improves OOD Detection with Pre-trained Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A straightforward pipeline for zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection involves selecting potential OOD labels from an extensive semantic pool and then leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model to perform classification on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD labels. In this paper, we theorize that enhancing performance requires expanding the semantic pool, while increasing the expected probability of selected OOD labels being activated by OOD samples, and ensuring low mutual dependence among the activations of these OOD labels. A natural expansion manner is to adopt a larger lexicon; however, the inevitable introduction of numerous synonyms and uncommon words fails to meet the above requirements, indicating that viable expansion manners move beyond merely selecting words from a lexicon. Since OOD detection aims to correctly classify input images into ID/OOD class groups, we can "make up" OOD label candidates which are not standard class names but beneficial for the process. Observing that the original semantic pool is comprised of unmodified specific class names, we correspondingly construct a conjugated semantic pool (CSP) consisting of modified superclass names, each serving as a cluster center for samples sharing similar properties across different categories. Consistent with our established theory, expanding OOD label candidates with the CSP satisfies the requirements and outperforms existing works by 7.89% in FPR95. Codes are available in https://github.com/MengyuanChen21/NeurIPS2024-CSP.</description>

      <title>Synth-SONAR: Sonar Image Synthesis with Enhanced Diversity and Realism via Dual Diffusion Models and GPT Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonar image synthesis is crucial for advancing applications in underwater exploration, marine biology, and defence. Traditional methods often rely on extensive and costly data collection using sonar sensors, jeopardizing data quality and diversity. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new sonar image synthesis framework, Synth-SONAR leveraging diffusion models and GPT prompting. The key novelties of Synth-SONAR are threefold: First, by integrating Generative AI-based style injection techniques along with publicly available real/simulated data, thereby producing one of the largest sonar data corpus for sonar research. Second, a dual text-conditioning sonar diffusion model hierarchy synthesizes coarse and fine-grained sonar images with enhanced quality and diversity. Third, high-level (coarse) and low-level (detailed) text-based sonar generation methods leverage advanced semantic information available in visual language models (VLMs) and GPT-prompting. During inference, the method generates diverse and realistic sonar images from textual prompts, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and sonar image generation. This marks the application of GPT-prompting in sonar imagery for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Synth-SONAR achieves state-of-the-art results in producing high-quality synthetic sonar datasets, significantly enhancing their diversity and realism.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Bidirectional Interaction Model for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a natural language expression and a remote sensing image, the goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to generate a pixel-level mask of the target object identified by the referring expression. In contrast to natural scenarios, expressions in RRSIS often involve complex geospatial relationships, with target objects of interest that vary significantly in scale and lack visual saliency, thereby increasing the difficulty of achieving precise segmentation. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel RRSIS framework is proposed, termed the cross-modal bidirectional interaction model (CroBIM). Specifically, a context-aware prompt modulation (CAPM) module is designed to integrate spatial positional relationships and task-specific knowledge into the linguistic features, thereby enhancing the ability to capture the target object. Additionally, a language-guided feature aggregation (LGFA) module is introduced to integrate linguistic information into multi-scale visual features, incorporating an attention deficit compensation mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, a mutual-interaction decoder (MID) is designed to enhance cross-modal feature alignment through cascaded bidirectional cross-attention, thereby enabling precise segmentation mask prediction. To further forster the research of RRSIS, we also construct RISBench, a new large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 52,472 image-language-label triplets. Extensive benchmarking on RISBench and two other prevalent datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed CroBIM over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The source code for CroBIM and the RISBench dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/CroBIM</description>

      <title>CryoFM: A Flow-based Foundation Model for Cryo-EM Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient line search for optimizing Area Under the ROC Curve in gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are useful for evaluation in binary classification and changepoint detection, but difficult to use for learning since the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is piecewise constant (gradient zero almost everywhere). Recently the Area Under Min (AUM) of false positive and false negative rates has been proposed as a differentiable surrogate for AUC. In this paper we study the piecewise linear/constant nature of the AUM/AUC, and propose new efficient path-following algorithms for choosing the learning rate which is optimal for each step of gradient descent (line search), when optimizing a linear model. Remarkably, our proposed line search algorithm has the same log-linear asymptotic time complexity as gradient descent with constant step size, but it computes a complete representation of the AUM/AUC as a function of step size. In our empirical study of binary classification problems, we verify that our proposed algorithm is fast and exact; in changepoint detection problems we show that the proposed algorithm is just as accurate as grid search, but faster.</description>

      <title>SOAK: Same/Other/All K-fold cross-validation for estimating similarity of patterns in data subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of machine learning, we are interested to know if it is possible to train on the data that we have gathered so far, and obtain accurate predictions on a new test data subset that is qualitatively different in some respect (time period, geographic region, etc). Another question is whether data subsets are similar enough so that it is beneficial to combine subsets during model training. We propose SOAK, Same/Other/All K-fold cross-validation, a new method which can be used to answer both questions. SOAK systematically compares models which are trained on different subsets of data, and then used for prediction on a fixed test subset, to estimate the similarity of learnable/predictable patterns in data subsets. We show results of using SOAK on six new real data sets (with geographic/temporal subsets, to check if predictions are accurate on new subsets), 3 image pair data sets (subsets are different image types, to check that we get smaller prediction error on similar images), and 11 benchmark data sets with predefined train/test splits (to check similarity of predefined splits).</description>

      <title>radarODE-MTL: A Multi-Task Learning Framework with Eccentric Gradient Alignment for Robust Radar-Based ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations. The code is available at: http://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL.</description>

      <title>RePD: Defending Jailbreak Attack through a Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce RePD, an innovative attack Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition framework designed to mitigate the risk of jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Despite rigorous pretraining and finetuning focused on ethical alignment, LLMs are still susceptible to jailbreak exploits. RePD operates on a one-shot learning model, wherein it accesses a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates to identify and decompose harmful inquiries embedded within user prompts. This process involves integrating the decomposition of the jailbreak prompt into the user's original query into a one-shot learning example to effectively teach the LLM to discern and separate malicious components. Consequently, the LLM is equipped to first neutralize any potentially harmful elements before addressing the user's prompt in a manner that aligns with its ethical guidelines. RePD is versatile and compatible with a variety of open-source LLMs acting as agents. Through comprehensive experimentation with both harmful and benign prompts, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed RePD in enhancing the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, without compromising their performance in responding to typical user requests.</description>

      <title>DistDD: Distributed Data Distillation Aggregation through Gradient Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DistDD, a novel approach within the federated learning framework that reduces the need for repetitive communication by distilling data directly on clients' devices. Unlike traditional federated learning that requires iterative model updates across nodes, DistDD facilitates a one-time distillation process that extracts a global distilled dataset, maintaining the privacy standards of federated learning while significantly cutting down communication costs. By leveraging the DistDD's distilled dataset, the developers of the FL can achieve just-in-time parameter tuning and neural architecture search over FL without repeating the whole FL process multiple times. We provide a detailed convergence proof of the DistDD algorithm, reinforcing its mathematical stability and reliability for practical applications. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DistDD, particularly in non-i.i.d. and mislabeled data scenarios, showcasing its potential to handle complex real-world data challenges distinctively from conventional federated learning methods. We also evaluate DistDD's application in the use case and prove its effectiveness and communication-savings in the NAS use case.</description>

      <title>DeltaDQ: Ultra-High Delta Compression for Fine-Tuned LLMs via Group-wise Dropout and Separate Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models achieve exceptional performance on various downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning. However, the diversity of downstream tasks and practical requirements makes deploying multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models challenging. Current methods that compress the delta weight struggle to achieve ultra-high compression, failing to minimize the deployment overhead. To address the above issue, we propose a novel distribution-driven delta compression framework DeltaDQ, which utilizes Group-wise Dropout and Separate Quantization to achieve ultra-high compression for the delta weight. We have observed that the matrix-computed intermediate results for the delta weight exhibit extremely small variance and min-max range characteristics, referred to as Balanced Intermediate Results. Exploiting this phenomenon, we introduce Group-wise Dropout to perform dropout on the delta weight using an optimal group size. Furthermore, using Separate Quantization, sparse weights are quantized and decomposed to achieve a lower bit. Experimental results show that DeltaDQ achieves 16x compression with improved accuracy compared to baselines for WizardMath and WizardCoder models across different parameter scales. Moreover, DeltaDQ demonstrates the ability for ultra-high compression ratio, achieving 128x compression for the WizardMath-7B model and 512x compression for the WizardMath-70B model.</description>

      <title>SmartPretrain: Model-Agnostic and Dataset-Agnostic Representation Learning for Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

      <title>Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Length extrapolation algorithms based on Rotary position embedding (RoPE) have shown promising results in extending the context length of language models. However, understanding how position embedding can capture longer-range contextual information remains elusive. Based on the intuition that different dimensions correspond to different frequency of changes in RoPE encoding, we conducted a dimension-level analysis to investigate the correlation between a hidden dimension of an attention head and its contribution to capturing long-distance dependencies. Using our correlation metric, we identified a particular type of attention heads, which we named Positional Heads, from various length-extrapolated models. These heads exhibit a strong focus on long-range information interaction and play a pivotal role in long input processing, as evidence by our ablation. We further demonstrate the correlation between the efficiency of length extrapolation and the extension of the high-dimensional attention allocation of these heads. The identification of Positional Heads provides insights for future research in long-text comprehension.</description>

      <title>From N-grams to Pre-trained Multilingual Models For Language Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of N-gram models and Large Pre-trained Multilingual models for Language Identification (LID) across 11 South African languages. For N-gram models, this study shows that effective data size selection remains crucial for establishing effective frequency distributions of the target languages, that efficiently model each language, thus, improving language ranking. For pre-trained multilingual models, we conduct extensive experiments covering a diverse set of massively pre-trained multilingual (PLM) models -- mBERT, RemBERT, XLM-r, and Afri-centric multilingual models -- AfriBERTa, Afro-XLMr, AfroLM, and Serengeti. We further compare these models with available large-scale Language Identification tools: Compact Language Detector v3 (CLD V3), AfroLID, GlotLID, and OpenLID to highlight the importance of focused-based LID. From these, we show that Serengeti is a superior model across models: N-grams to Transformers on average. Moreover, we propose a lightweight BERT-based LID model (za_BERT_lid) trained with NHCLT + Vukzenzele corpus, which performs on par with our best-performing Afri-centric models.</description>

      <title>Developing a Pragmatic Benchmark for Assessing Korean Legal Language Understanding in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the legal domain, with GPT-4 even passing the Uniform Bar Exam in the U.S. However their efficacy remains limited for non-standardized tasks and tasks in languages other than English. This underscores the need for careful evaluation of LLMs within each legal system before application. Here, we introduce KBL, a benchmark for assessing the Korean legal language understanding of LLMs, consisting of (1) 7 legal knowledge tasks (510 examples), (2) 4 legal reasoning tasks (288 examples), and (3) the Korean bar exam (4 domains, 53 tasks, 2,510 examples). First two datasets were developed in close collaboration with lawyers to evaluate LLMs in practical scenarios in a certified manner. Furthermore, considering legal practitioners' frequent use of extensive legal documents for research, we assess LLMs in both a closed book setting, where they rely solely on internal knowledge, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setting, using a corpus of Korean statutes and precedents. The results indicate substantial room and opportunities for improvement.</description>

      <title>Hespi: A pipeline for automatically detecting information from hebarium specimen sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specimen associated biodiversity data are sought after for biological, environmental, climate, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is required for the extraction of data from specimen images to eliminate the bottleneck that the reliance on human-mediated transcription of these data represents. We applied advanced computer vision techniques to develop the `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline), which extracts a pre-catalogue subset of collection data on the institutional labels on herbarium specimens from their digital images. The pipeline integrates two object detection models; the first detects bounding boxes around text-based labels and the second detects bounding boxes around text-based data fields on the primary institutional label. The pipeline classifies text-based institutional labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or a combination and applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for data extraction. The recognized text is then corrected against authoritative databases of taxon names. The extracted text is also corrected with the aide of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text for test datasets including specimen sheet images from international herbaria. The components of the pipeline are modular and users can train their own models with their own data and use them in place of the models provided.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GNNs with Architecture-Agnostic Graph Transformations: A Systematic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a wide variety of graph neural network (GNN) architectures have emerged, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and complexities. Various techniques, including rewiring, lifting, and node annotation with centrality values, have been employed as pre-processing steps to enhance GNN performance. However, there are no universally accepted best practices, and the impact of architecture and pre-processing on performance often remains opaque.
  This study systematically explores the impact of various graph transformations as pre-processing steps on the performance of common GNN architectures across standard datasets. The models are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, referred to as expressivity.
  Our findings reveal that certain transformations, particularly those augmenting node features with centrality measures, consistently improve expressivity. However, these gains come with trade-offs, as methods like graph encoding, while enhancing expressivity, introduce numerical inaccuracies widely-used python packages. Additionally, we observe that these pre-processing techniques are limited when addressing complex tasks involving 3-WL and 4-WL indistinguishable graphs.</description>

      <title>Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.</description>

      <title>Integrating Supertag Features into Neural Discontinuous Constituent Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Syntactic parsing is essential in natural-language processing, with constituent structure being one widely used description of syntax. Traditional views of constituency demand that constituents consist of adjacent words, but this poses challenges in analysing syntax with non-local dependencies, common in languages like German. Therefore, in a number of treebanks like NeGra and TIGER for German and DPTB for English, long-range dependencies are represented by crossing edges. Various grammar formalisms have been used to describe discontinuous trees - often with high time complexities for parsing. Transition-based parsing aims at reducing this factor by eliminating the need for an explicit grammar. Instead, neural networks are trained to produce trees given raw text input using supervised learning on large annotated corpora. An elegant proposal for a stack-free transition-based parser developed by Coavoux and Cohen (2019) successfully allows for the derivation of any discontinuous constituent tree over a sentence in worst-case quadratic time.
  The purpose of this work is to explore the introduction of supertag information into transition-based discontinuous constituent parsing. In lexicalised grammar formalisms like CCG (Steedman, 1989) informative categories are assigned to the words in a sentence and act as the building blocks for composing the sentence's syntax. These supertags indicate a word's structural role and syntactic relationship with surrounding items. The study examines incorporating supertag information by using a dedicated supertagger as additional input for a neural parser (pipeline) and by jointly training a neural model for both parsing and supertagging (multi-task). In addition to CCG, several other frameworks (LTAG-spinal, LCFRS) and sequence labelling tasks (chunking, dependency parsing) will be compared in terms of their suitability as auxiliary tasks for parsing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Object Tracking on Edge Devices via Reconstruction-Based Channel Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of multi-object tracking (MOT) technologies presents the dual challenge of maintaining high performance while addressing critical security and privacy concerns. In applications such as pedestrian tracking, where sensitive personal data is involved, the potential for privacy violations and data misuse becomes a significant issue if data is transmitted to external servers. To mitigate these risks, processing data directly on an edge device, such as a smart camera, has emerged as a viable solution. Edge computing ensures that sensitive information remains local, thereby aligning with stringent privacy principles and significantly reducing network latency. However, the implementation of MOT on edge devices is not without its challenges. Edge devices typically possess limited computational resources, necessitating the development of highly optimized algorithms capable of delivering real-time performance under these constraints. The disparity between the computational requirements of state-of-the-art MOT algorithms and the capabilities of edge devices emphasizes a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, we propose a neural network pruning method specifically tailored to compress complex networks, such as those used in modern MOT systems. This approach optimizes MOT performance by ensuring high accuracy and efficiency within the constraints of limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano. By applying our pruning method, we achieve model size reductions of up to 70% while maintaining a high level of accuracy and further improving performance on the Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for edge computing applications.</description>

      <title>F2A: An Innovative Approach for Prompt Injection by Utilizing Feign Security Detection Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous mature applications of LLMs have emerged in the field of content safety detection. However, we have found that LLMs exhibit blind trust in safety detection agents. The general LLMs can be compromised by hackers with this vulnerability. Hence, this paper proposed an attack named Feign Agent Attack (F2A).Through such malicious forgery methods, adding fake safety detection results into the prompt, the defense mechanism of LLMs can be bypassed, thereby obtaining harmful content and hijacking the normal conversation.Continually, a series of experiments were conducted. In these experiments, the hijacking capability of F2A on LLMs was analyzed and demonstrated, exploring the fundamental reasons why LLMs blindly trust safety detection results. The experiments involved various scenarios where fake safety detection results were injected into prompts, and the responses were closely monitored to understand the extent of the vulnerability. Also, this paper provided a reasonable solution to this attack, emphasizing that it is important for LLMs to critically evaluate the results of augmented agents to prevent the generating harmful content. By doing so, the reliability and security can be significantly improved, protecting the LLMs from F2A.</description>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently been adopted in robotics for their capability in common sense reasoning and generalizability. Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.</description>

      <title>M$^3$-Impute: Mask-guided Representation Learning for Missing Value Imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing values are a common problem that poses significant challenges to data analysis and machine learning. This problem necessitates the development of an effective imputation method to fill in the missing values accurately, thereby enhancing the overall quality and utility of the datasets. Existing imputation methods, however, fall short of explicitly considering the `missingness' information in the data during the embedding initialization stage and modeling the entangled feature and sample correlations during the learning process, thus leading to inferior performance. We propose M$^3$-Impute, which aims to explicitly leverage the missingness information and such correlations with novel masking schemes. M$^3$-Impute first models the data as a bipartite graph and uses a graph neural network to learn node embeddings, where the refined embedding initialization process directly incorporates the missingness information. They are then optimized through M$^3$-Impute's novel feature correlation unit (FRU) and sample correlation unit (SRU) that effectively captures feature and sample correlations for imputation. Experiment results on 25 benchmark datasets under three different missingness settings show the effectiveness of M$^3$-Impute by achieving 20 best and 4 second-best MAE scores on average.</description>

      <title>DCNet: A Data-Driven Framework for DVL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are underwater robotic platforms used in a variety of applications. An AUV's navigation solution relies heavily on the fusion of inertial sensors and Doppler velocity logs (DVL), where the latter delivers accurate velocity updates. To ensure accurate navigation, a DVL calibration is undertaken before the mission begins to estimate its error terms. During calibration, the AUV follows a complex trajectory and employs nonlinear estimation filters to estimate error terms. In this paper, we introduce DCNet, a data-driven framework that utilizes a two-dimensional convolution kernel in an innovative way. Using DCNet and our proposed DVL error model, we offer a rapid calibration procedure. This can be applied to a trajectory with a nearly constant velocity. To train and test our proposed approach a dataset of 276 minutes long with real DVL recorded measurements was used. We demonstrated an average improvement of 70% in accuracy and 80% improvement in calibration time, compared to the baseline approach, with a low-performance DVL. As a result of those improvements, an AUV employing a low-cost DVL, can achieve higher accuracy, shorter calibration time, and apply a simple nearly constant velocity calibration trajectory. Our results also open up new applications for marine robotics utilizing low-cost, high-accurate DVLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning is a central component for aligning current LLMs, but this process can be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. To address this concern, we introduce PoisonBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' susceptibility to data poisoning during preference learning. Data poisoning attacks can manipulate large language model responses to include hidden malicious content or biases, potentially causing the model to generate harmful or unintended outputs while appearing to function normally. We deploy two distinct attack types across eight realistic scenarios, assessing 21 widely-used models. Our findings reveal concerning trends: (1) Scaling up parameter size does not inherently enhance resilience against poisoning attacks; (2) There exists a log-linear relationship between the effects of the attack and the data poison ratio; (3) The effect of data poisoning can generalize to extrapolated triggers that are not included in the poisoned data. These results expose weaknesses in current preference learning techniques, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defenses against malicious models and data manipulation.</description>

      <title>StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SOLD: Reinforcement Learning with Slot Object-Centric Latent Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning a latent dynamics model provides a task-agnostic representation of an agent's understanding of its environment. Leveraging this knowledge for model-based reinforcement learning holds the potential to improve sample efficiency over model-free methods by learning inside imagined rollouts. Furthermore, because the latent space serves as input to behavior models, the informative representations learned by the world model facilitate efficient learning of desired skills. Most existing methods rely on holistic representations of the environment's state. In contrast, humans reason about objects and their interactions, forecasting how actions will affect specific parts of their surroundings. Inspired by this, we propose Slot-Attention for Object-centric Latent Dynamics (SOLD), a novel algorithm that learns object-centric dynamics models in an unsupervised manner from pixel inputs. We demonstrate that the structured latent space not only improves model interpretability but also provides a valuable input space for behavior models to reason over. Our results show that SOLD outperforms DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, across a range of benchmark robotic environments that evaluate for both relational reasoning and low-level manipulation capabilities.

      <title>One-shot Generative Domain Adaptation in 3D GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D-aware image generation necessitates extensive training data to ensure stable training and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This paper first considers a novel task known as One-shot 3D Generative Domain Adaptation (GDA), aimed at transferring a pre-trained 3D generator from one domain to a new one, relying solely on a single reference image. One-shot 3D GDA is characterized by the pursuit of specific attributes, namely, high fidelity, large diversity, cross-domain consistency, and multi-view consistency. Within this paper, we introduce 3D-Adapter, the first one-shot 3D GDA method, for diverse and faithful generation. Our approach begins by judiciously selecting a restricted weight set for fine-tuning, and subsequently leverages four advanced loss functions to facilitate adaptation. An efficient progressive fine-tuning strategy is also implemented to enhance the adaptation process. The synergy of these three technological components empowers 3D-Adapter to achieve remarkable performance, substantiated both quantitatively and qualitatively, across all desired properties of 3D GDA. Furthermore, 3D-Adapter seamlessly extends its capabilities to zero-shot scenarios, and preserves the potential for crucial tasks such as interpolation, reconstruction, and editing within the latent space of the pre-trained generator. Code will be available at https://github.com/iceli1007/3D-Adapter.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Secrets: An LLM-Augmented Linear Model for Explainable and Calibratable Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific fields, such as drug discovery and material science. Despite delivering intrinsic explainability, linear models struggle with capturing complex, non-linear patterns. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, yield accurate predictions through powerful inference capabilities yet fail to provide chemically meaningful explanations for their predictions. This work proposes a novel framework, called MoleX, which leverages LLM knowledge to build a simple yet powerful linear model for accurate molecular property prediction with faithful explanations. The core of MoleX is to model complicated molecular structure-property relationships using a simple linear model, augmented by LLM knowledge and a crafted calibration strategy. Specifically, to extract the maximum amount of task-relevant knowledge from LLM embeddings, we employ information bottleneck-inspired fine-tuning and sparsity-inducing dimensionality reduction. These informative embeddings are then used to fit a linear model for explainable inference. Moreover, we introduce residual calibration to address prediction errors stemming from linear models' insufficient expressiveness of complex LLM embeddings, thus recovering the LLM's predictive power and boosting overall accuracy. Theoretically, we provide a mathematical foundation to justify MoleX's explainability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoleX outperforms existing methods in molecular property prediction, establishing a new milestone in predictive performance, explainability, and efficiency. In particular, MoleX enables CPU inference and accelerates large-scale dataset processing, achieving comparable performance 300x faster with 100,000 fewer parameters than LLMs. Additionally, the calibration improves model performance by up to 12.7% without compromising explainability.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Generation of Diverse Low-Bandgap Molecules with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Interactive Imitation Learning: Handling Expert Shift and Intermittent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</description>

      <title>MATCH: Model-Aware TVM-based Compilation for Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streamlining the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on heterogeneous edge platforms, coupling within the same micro-controller unit (MCU) instruction processors and hardware accelerators for tensor computations, is becoming one of the crucial challenges of the TinyML field.
  The best-performing DNN compilation toolchains are usually deeply customized for a single MCU family, and porting to a different heterogeneous MCU family implies labor-intensive re-development of almost the entire compiler. On the opposite side, retargetable toolchains, such as TVM, fail to exploit the capabilities of custom accelerators, resulting in the generation of general but unoptimized code. To overcome this duality, we introduce MATCH, a novel TVM-based DNN deployment framework designed for easy agile retargeting across different MCU processors and accelerators, thanks to a customizable model-based hardware abstraction.
  We show that a general and retargetable mapping framework enhanced with hardware cost models can compete with and even outperform custom toolchains on diverse targets while only needing the definition of an abstract hardware model and a SoC-specific API.
  We tested MATCH on two state-of-the-art heterogeneous MCUs, GAP9 and DIANA.
  On the four DNN models of the MLPerf Tiny suite MATCH reduces inference latency by up to 60.88 times on DIANA, compared to using the plain TVM, thanks to the exploitation of the on-board HW accelerator. Compared to HTVM, a fully customized toolchain for DIANA, we still reduce the latency by 16.94%. On GAP9, using the same benchmarks, we improve the latency by 2.15 times compared to the dedicated DORY compiler, thanks to our heterogeneous DNN mapping approach that synergically exploits the DNN accelerator and the eight-cores cluster available on board.</description>

      <title>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Watermarks, Transferable Attacks and Adversarial Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize and extend existing definitions of backdoor-based watermarks and adversarial defenses as interactive protocols between two players. The existence of these schemes is inherently tied to the learning tasks for which they are designed. Our main result shows that for almost every discriminative learning task, at least one of the two -- a watermark or an adversarial defense -- exists. The term "almost every" indicates that we also identify a third, counterintuitive but necessary option, i.e., a scheme we call a transferable attack. By transferable attack, we refer to an efficient algorithm computing queries that look indistinguishable from the data distribution and fool all efficient defenders. To this end, we prove the necessity of a transferable attack via a construction that uses a cryptographic tool called homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, we show that any task that satisfies our notion of a transferable attack implies a cryptographic primitive, thus requiring the underlying task to be computationally complex. These two facts imply an "equivalence" between the existence of transferable attacks and cryptography. Finally, we show that the class of tasks of bounded VC-dimension has an adversarial defense, and a subclass of them has a watermark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently an extension to higher-order logic -- called DHOL -- was introduced, enriching the language with dependent types, and creating a powerful extensional type theory. In this paper we propose two ways how choice can be added to DHOL. We extend the DHOL term structure by Hilbert's indefinite choice operator $\epsilon$, define a translation of the choice terms to HOL choice that extends the existing translation from DHOL to HOL and show that the extension of the translation is complete and give an argument for soundness. We finally evaluate the extended translation on a set of dependent HOL problems that require choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banks are important for the development of economies in any financial ecosystem through consumer and business loans. Lending, however, presents risks; thus, banks have to determine the applicant's financial position to reduce the probabilities of default. A number of banks have currently, therefore, adopted data analytics and state-of-the-art technology to arrive at better decisions in the process. The probability of payback is prescribed by a predictive modeling technique in which machine learning algorithms are applied. In this research project, we will apply several machine learning methods to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of loan approval processes. Our work focuses on the prediction of bank loan approval; we have worked on a dataset of 148,670 instances and 37 attributes using machine learning methods. The target property segregates the loan applications into "Approved" and "Denied" groups. various machine learning techniques have been used, namely, Decision Tree Categorization, AdaBoosting, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and GaussianNB. Following that, the models were trained and evaluated. Among these, the best-performing algorithm was AdaBoosting, which achieved an incredible accuracy of 99.99%. The results therefore show how ensemble learning works effectively to improve the prediction skills of loan approval decisions. The presented work points to the possibility of achieving extremely accurate and efficient loan prediction models that provide useful insights for applying machine learning to financial domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that enables multiple entities to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. Over the past decade, FL systems have achieved substantial progress, scaling to millions of devices across various learning domains while offering meaningful differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Production systems from organizations like Google, Apple, and Meta demonstrate the real-world applicability of FL. However, key challenges remain, including verifying server-side DP guarantees and coordinating training across heterogeneous devices, limiting broader adoption. Additionally, emerging trends such as large (multi-modal) models and blurred lines between training, inference, and personalization challenge traditional FL frameworks. In response, we propose a redefined FL framework that prioritizes privacy principles rather than rigid definitions. We also chart a path forward by leveraging trusted execution environments and open-source ecosystems to address these challenges and facilitate future advancements in FL.</description>

      <title>Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often demands complex and deep architectures, which are expensive to compute and train. Within the world model, dynamics models are particularly crucial for accurate predictions, and various dynamics-model architectures have been explored, each with its own set of challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN) based world models face issues such as vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies effectively. In contrast, use of transformers suffers from the well-known issues of self-attention mechanisms, where both memory and computational complexity scale as $O(n^2)$, with $n$ representing the sequence length.
  To address these challenges we propose a state space model (SSM) based world model, specifically based on Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and facilitating the use of longer training sequences efficiently. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early stages of training, combining it with the aforementioned technique to achieve a normalised score comparable to other state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms using only a 7 million trainable parameter world model. This model is accessible and can be trained on an off-the-shelf laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/drama.git.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Models for Contrast-Enhanced Synthesis of T1w and T1 Maps in Brain MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast enhancement by Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is a vital tool for tumor diagnosis in neuroradiology. Based on brain MRI scans of glioblastoma before and after Gadolinium administration, we address enhancement prediction by neural networks with two new contributions. Firstly, we study the potential of generative models, more precisely conditional diffusion and flow matching, for uncertainty quantification in virtual enhancement. Secondly, we examine the performance of T1 scans from quantitive MRI versus T1-weighted scans. In contrast to T1-weighted scans, these scans have the advantage of a physically meaningful and thereby comparable voxel range. To compare network prediction performance of these two modalities with incompatible gray-value scales, we propose to evaluate segmentations of contrast-enhanced regions of interest using Dice and Jaccard scores. Across models, we observe better segmentations with T1 scans than with T1-weighted scans.</description>

      <title>Utilizing ChatGPT in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course: A Teaching Assistant's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is revolutionizing the field of computer science education. These models offer new possibilities for enriching student learning and supporting teaching assistants (TAs) in providing prompt feedback and supplementary learning resources. This research delves into the use of ChatGPT in a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course, particularly when combined with TA supervision. The findings demonstrate that incorporating ChatGPT with structured prompts and active TA guidance enhances students' understanding of intricate algorithmic concepts, boosts engagement, and elevates academic performance. However, challenges exist in addressing academic integrity and the limitations of LLMs in tackling complex problems. The study underscores the importance of active TA involvement in reducing students' reliance on AI-generated content and amplifying the overall educational impact. The results suggest that while LLMs can be advantageous for education, their successful integration demands continuous oversight and a thoughtful balance between AI and human guidance.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Cross-Domain Argumentative Stance Classification on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Argumentative stance classification plays a key role in identifying authors' viewpoints on specific topics. However, generating diverse pairs of argumentative sentences across various domains is challenging. Existing benchmarks often come from a single domain or focus on a limited set of topics. Additionally, manual annotation for accurate labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging platform rules, readily available expert-curated content, and large language models to bypass the need for human annotation. Our approach produces a multidomain benchmark comprising 4,498 topical claims and 30,961 arguments from three sources, spanning 21 domains. We benchmark the dataset in fully supervised, zero-shot, and few-shot settings, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of different methodologies. We release the dataset and code in this study at hidden for anonymity.</description>

      <title>Test-driven Software Experimentation with LASSO: an LLM Benchmarking Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical software engineering faces a critical gap: the lack of standardized tools for rapid development and execution of Test-Driven Software Experiments (TDSEs) - that is, experiments that involve the execution of software subjects and the observation and analysis of their "de facto" run-time behavior. In this paper we present a general-purpose analysis platform called LASSO that provides a minimal set of domain-specific languages and data structures to conduct TDSEs. By empowering users with an executable scripting language to design and execute TDSEs, LASSO enables efficient evaluation of run-time semantics and execution characteristics in addition to statically determined properties. We present an example TDSE that demonstrates the practical benefits of LASSO's scripting capabilities for assessing the reliability of LLMs for code generation by means of a self-contained, reusable and extensible study script. The LASSO platform is freely available at: https://softwareobservatorium.github.io/, and a demo video is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/tzY9oNTWXzw</description>

      <title>Efficient Hyperparameter Importance Assessment for CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is an essential aspect of the machine learning pipeline, profoundly impacting models' robustness, stability, and generalization capabilities. Given the complex hyperparameter spaces associated with Neural Networks and the constraints of computational resources and time, optimizing all hyperparameters becomes impractical. In this context, leveraging hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can provide valuable guidance by narrowing down the search space. This enables machine learning practitioners to focus their optimization efforts on the hyperparameters with the most significant impact on model performance while conserving time and resources. This paper aims to quantify the importance weights of some hyperparameters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with an algorithm called N-RReliefF, laying the groundwork for applying HIA methodologies in the Deep Learning field. We conduct an extensive study by training over ten thousand CNN models across ten popular image classification datasets, thereby acquiring a comprehensive dataset containing hyperparameter configuration instances and their corresponding performance metrics. It is demonstrated that among the investigated hyperparameters, the top five important hyperparameters of the CNN model are the number of convolutional layers, learning rate, dropout rate, optimizer and epoch.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Design Space of Cognitive Engagement Techniques with AI-Generated Code for Enhanced Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novice programmers are increasingly relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code for learning programming concepts. However, this interaction can lead to superficial engagement, giving learners an illusion of learning and hindering skill development. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic design exploration to develop seven cognitive engagement techniques aimed at promoting deeper engagement with AI-generated code. In this paper, we describe our design process, the initial seven techniques and results from a between-subjects study (N=82). We then iteratively refined the top techniques and further evaluated them through a within-subjects study (N=42). We evaluate the friction each technique introduces, their effectiveness in helping learners apply concepts to isomorphic tasks without AI assistance, and their success in aligning learners' perceived and actual coding abilities. Ultimately, our results highlight the most effective technique: guiding learners through the step-by-step problem-solving process, where they engage in an interactive dialog with the AI, prompting what needs to be done at each stage before the corresponding code is revealed.</description>

      <title>HyperPg -- Prototypical Gaussians on the Hypersphere for Interpretable Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prototype Learning methods provide an interpretable alternative to black-box deep learning models. Approaches such as ProtoPNet learn, which part of a test image "look like" known prototypical parts from training images, combining predictive power with the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning. However, existing approaches have two main drawbacks: A) They rely solely on deterministic similarity scores without statistical confidence. B) The prototypes are learned in a black-box manner without human input. This work introduces HyperPg, a new prototype representation leveraging Gaussian distributions on a hypersphere in latent space, with learnable mean and variance. HyperPg prototypes adapt to the spread of clusters in the latent space and output likelihood scores. The new architecture, HyperPgNet, leverages HyperPg to learn prototypes aligned with human concepts from pixel-level annotations. Consequently, each prototype represents a specific concept such as color, image texture, or part of the image subject. A concept extraction pipeline built on foundation models provides pixel-level annotations, significantly reducing human labeling effort. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate that HyperPgNet outperforms other prototype learning architectures while using fewer parameters and training steps. Additionally, the concept-aligned HyperPg prototypes are learned transparently, enhancing model interpretability.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Pupil Segmentation with SAM 2: A Case Study of Over 14 Million Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the transformative potential of SAM 2, a vision foundation model, in advancing gaze estimation and eye tracking technologies. By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Lingual LLM Evaluation for European Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing across numerous languages and tasks. However, evaluating LLM performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a cross-lingual evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K. The benchmarks and results are made publicly available to encourage further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Potential of Synthetic Data: Insights from Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has gained attention for training large language models, but poor-quality data can harm performance (see, e.g., Shumailov et al. (2023); Seddik et al. (2024)). A potential solution is data pruning, which retains only high-quality data based on a score function (human or machine feedback). Previous work Feng et al. (2024) analyzed models trained on synthetic data as sample size increases. We extend this by using random matrix theory to derive the performance of a binary classifier trained on a mix of real and pruned synthetic data in a high dimensional setting. Our findings identify conditions where synthetic data could improve performance, focusing on the quality of the generative model and verification strategy. We also show a smooth phase transition in synthetic label noise, contrasting with prior sharp behavior in infinite sample limits. Experiments with toy models and large language models validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Meta-Transfer Learning Empowered Temporal Graph Networks for Cross-City Real Estate Appraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real estate appraisal is important for a variety of endeavors such as real estate deals, investment analysis, and real property taxation. Recently, deep learning has shown great promise for real estate appraisal by harnessing substantial online transaction data from web platforms. Nonetheless, deep learning is data-hungry, and thus it may not be trivially applicable to enormous small cities with limited data. To this end, we propose Meta-Transfer Learning Empowered Temporal Graph Networks (MetaTransfer) to transfer valuable knowledge from multiple data-rich metropolises to the data-scarce city to improve valuation performance. Specifically, by modeling the ever-growing real estate transactions with associated residential communities as a temporal event heterogeneous graph, we first design an Event-Triggered Temporal Graph Network to model the irregular spatiotemporal correlations between evolving real estate transactions. Besides, we formulate the city-wide real estate appraisal as a multi-task dynamic graph link label prediction problem, where the valuation of each community in a city is regarded as an individual task. A Hypernetwork-Based Multi-Task Learning module is proposed to simultaneously facilitate intra-city knowledge sharing between multiple communities and task-specific parameters generation to accommodate the community-wise real estate price distribution. Furthermore, we propose a Tri-Level Optimization Based Meta- Learning framework to adaptively re-weight training transaction instances from multiple source cities to mitigate negative transfer, and thus improve the cross-city knowledge transfer effectiveness. Finally, extensive experiments based on five real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of MetaTransfer compared with eleven baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Social Conventions in LLM populations: Spontaneous Emergence, Collective Biases and Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social conventions are the foundation for social and economic life. As legions of AI agents increasingly interact with each other and with humans, their ability to form shared conventions will determine how effectively they will coordinate behaviors, integrate into society and influence it. Here, we investigate the dynamics of conventions within populations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using simulated interactions. First, we show that globally accepted social conventions can spontaneously arise from local interactions between communicating LLMs. Second, we demonstrate how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when individual agents appear to be unbiased. Third, we examine how minority groups of committed LLMs can drive social change by establishing new social conventions. We show that once these minority groups reach a critical size, they can consistently overturn established behaviors. In all cases, contrasting the experimental results with predictions from a minimal multi-agent model allows us to isolate the specific role of LLM agents. Our results clarify how AI systems can autonomously develop norms without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align with human values and societal goals.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Transferability of Generalized "Skip Connections"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skip connection is an essential ingredient for modern deep models to be deeper and more powerful. Despite their huge success in normal scenarios (state-of-the-art classification performance on natural examples), we investigate and identify an interesting property of skip connections under adversarial scenarios, namely, the use of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, in ResNet-like models (with skip connections), we find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor during backpropagation allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. The above method is termed as Skip Gradient Method (SGM). Although starting from ResNet-like models in vision domains, we further extend SGM to more advanced architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs) and models with length-varying paths and other domains, i.e. natural language processing. We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against various models including ResNets, Transformers, Inceptions, Neural Architecture Search, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that employing SGM can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, considering the big complexity for practical use, we further demonstrate that SGM can even improve the transferability on ensembles of models or targeted attacks and the stealthiness against current defenses. At last, we provide theoretical explanations and empirical insights on how SGM works. Our findings not only motivate new adversarial research into the architectural characteristics of models but also open up further challenges for secure model architecture design. Our code is available at https://github.com/mo666666/SGM.</description>

Abstract: Federated Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (F-KANs) have already been proposed, but their assessment is at an initial stage. We present a comparison between KANs (using B-splines and Radial Basis Functions as activation functions) and Multi- Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with a similar number of parameters for 100 rounds of federated learning in the MNIST classification task using non-IID partitions with 100 clients. After 15 trials for each model, we show that the best accuracies achieved by MLPs can be achieved by Spline-KANs in half of the time (in rounds), with just a moderate increase in computing time.</description>

      <title>Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding for Multilingual Self-improving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.
  We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts.
  We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.</description>

      <title>NoVo: Norm Voting off Hallucinations with Attention Heads in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a major obstacle, particularly in high-stakes applications where factual accuracy is critical. While representation editing and reading methods have made strides in reducing hallucinations, their heavy reliance on specialised tools and training on in-domain samples, makes them difficult to scale and prone to overfitting. This limits their accuracy gains and generalizability to diverse datasets. This paper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the untapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual accuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by automatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient, inference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to effortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are employed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in prediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current state-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least 19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse datasets, with significant gains in over 90\% of them, far exceeding all current representation editing and reading methods. NoVo also reveals promising gains to finetuning strategies and building textual adversarial defence. NoVo's effectiveness with head norms opens new frontiers in LLM interpretability, robustness and reliability.</description>

      <title>ALVIN: Active Learning Via INterpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Learning aims to minimize annotation effort by selecting the most useful instances from a pool of unlabeled data. However, typical active learning methods overlook the presence of distinct example groups within a class, whose prevalence may vary, e.g., in occupation classification datasets certain demographics are disproportionately represented in specific classes. This oversight causes models to rely on shortcuts for predictions, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels occurring in well-represented groups. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning Via INterpolation (ALVIN), which conducts intra-class interpolations between examples from under-represented and well-represented groups to create anchors, i.e., artificial points situated between the example groups in the representation space. By selecting instances close to the anchors for annotation, ALVIN identifies informative examples exposing the model to regions of the representation space that counteract the influence of shortcuts. Crucially, since the model considers these examples to be of high certainty, they are likely to be ignored by typical active learning methods. Experimental results on six datasets encompassing sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection demonstrate that ALVIN outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Instruments for Partial Identification of Treatment Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of treatment effects from observational data is important in many disciplines such as medicine. However, estimation is challenging when unconfoundedness as a standard assumption in the causal inference literature is violated. In this work, we leverage arbitrary (potentially high-dimensional) instruments to estimate bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a novel approach for partial identification through a mapping of instruments to a discrete representation space so that we yield valid bounds on the CATE. This is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. (2) We derive a two-step procedure that learns tight bounds using a tailored neural partitioning of the latent instrument space. As a result, we avoid instability issues due to numerical approximations or adversarial training. Furthermore, our procedure aims to reduce the estimation variance in finite-sample settings to yield more reliable estimates. (3) We show theoretically that our procedure obtains valid bounds while reducing estimation variance. We further perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness across various settings. Overall, our procedure offers a novel path for practitioners to make use of potentially high-dimensional instruments (e.g., as in Mendelian randomization).</description>

      <title>Overcoming Slow Decision Frequencies in Continuous Control: Model-Based Sequence Reinforcement Learning for Model-Free Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. Such speeds are difficult to achieve in the real world and often requires specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Additionally, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves superior FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning.</description>

      <title>SubZero: Random Subspace Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>The structure of the token space for large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models encode the correlational structure present in natural language by fitting segments of utterances (tokens) into a high dimensional ambient latent space upon which the models then operate. We assert that in order to develop a foundational, first-principles understanding of the behavior and limitations of large language models, it is crucial to understand the topological and geometric structure of this token subspace. In this article, we present estimators for the dimension and Ricci scalar curvature of the token subspace, and apply it to three open source large language models of moderate size: GPT2, LLEMMA7B, and MISTRAL7B. In all three models, using these measurements, we find that the token subspace is not a manifold, but is instead a stratified manifold, where on each of the individual strata, the Ricci curvature is significantly negative. We additionally find that the dimension and curvature correlate with generative fluency of the models, which suggest that these findings have implications for model behavior.</description>

Abstract: There have been key advancements to building universal approximators for multi-goal collections of reinforcement learning value functions -- key elements in estimating long-term returns of states in a parameterized manner. We extend this to hierarchical reinforcement learning, using the options framework, by introducing hierarchical universal value function approximators (H-UVFAs). This allows us to leverage the added benefits of scaling, planning, and generalization expected in temporal abstraction settings. We develop supervised and reinforcement learning methods for learning embeddings of the states, goals, options, and actions in the two hierarchical value functions: $Q(s, g, o; \theta)$ and $Q(s, g, o, a; \theta)$. Finally we demonstrate generalization of the HUVFAs and show they outperform corresponding UVFAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment &amp; operation, and system architecture &amp; orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains. Our dataset, results, code and used prompts can be found in our online replication package at https://github.com/SAILResearch/fmse-blogs.</description>

      <title>AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents. We publicly release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</description>

      <title>PEAR: A Robust and Flexible Automation Framework for Ptychography Enabled by Multiple Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is an advanced computational imaging technique in X-ray and electron microscopy. It has been widely adopted across scientific research fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various automation levels and is designed to work with customized local knowledge bases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across different research environments.</description>

      <title>Mentor-KD: Making Small Language Models Better Multi-step Reasoners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable performances across various complex tasks by leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.</description>

      <title>Transforming In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection: VAE-based Knowledge Distillation Meets Explainable AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, ensuring robust in-vehicle network (IVN) security is paramount. This paper introduces an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) called KD-XVAE that uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based knowledge distillation approach to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our model significantly reduces complexity, operating with just 1669 parameters and achieving an inference time of 0.3 ms per batch, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained automotive environments. Evaluations in the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset demonstrate exceptional capabilities, attaining perfect scores (Recall, Precision, F1 Score of 100%, and FNR of 0%) under multiple attack types, including DoS, Fuzzing, Gear Spoofing, and RPM Spoofing. Comparative analysis on the CICIoV2024 dataset further underscores its superiority over traditional machine learning models, achieving perfect detection metrics. We furthermore integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency in the model's decisions. The VAE compresses the original feature space into a latent space, on which the distilled model is trained. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the importance of each latent dimension, mapped back to original features for intuitive understanding. Our paper advances the field by integrating state-of-the-art techniques, addressing critical challenges in the deployment of efficient, trustworthy, and reliable IDSes for autonomous vehicles, ensuring enhanced protection against emerging cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.

      <title>Modular Multimodal Machine Learning for Extraction of Theorems and Proofs in Long Scientific Documents (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the extraction of mathematical statements and their proofs from scholarly PDF articles as a multimodal classification problem, utilizing text, font features, and bitmap image renderings of PDFs as distinct modalities. We propose a modular sequential multimodal machine learning approach specifically designed for extracting theorem-like environments and proofs. This is based on a cross-modal attention mechanism to generate multimodal paragraph embeddings, which are then fed into our novel multimodal sliding window transformer architecture to capture sequential information across paragraphs. Our document AI methodology stands out as it eliminates the need for OCR preprocessing, LaTeX sources during inference, or custom pre-training on specialized losses to understand cross-modality relationships. Unlike many conventional approaches that operate at a single-page level, ours can be directly applied to multi-page PDFs and seamlessly handles the page breaks often found in lengthy scientific mathematical documents. Our approach demonstrates performance improvements obtained by transitioning from unimodality to multimodality, and finally by incorporating sequential modeling over paragraphs.</description>

      <title>Explainable Attention for Few-shot Learning and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have exhibited promising potential in enhancing learning models by identifying salient portions of input data. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where limited training samples are accessible due to challenges in data collection and labeling. Drawing inspiration from human recognition processes, we posit that an AI baseline's performance could be more accurate and dependable if it is exposed to essential segments of raw data rather than the entire input dataset, akin to human perception. However, the task of selecting these informative data segments, referred to as hard attention finding, presents a formidable challenge. In situations with few training samples, existing studies struggle to locate such informative regions due to the large number of training parameters that cannot be effectively learned from the available limited samples. In this study, we introduce a novel and practical framework for achieving explainable hard attention finding, specifically tailored for few-shot learning scenarios, called FewXAT. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning to implement the concept of hard attention, directly impacting raw input data and thus rendering the process interpretable for human understanding. Through extensive experimentation across various benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>DeLLMa: Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa.</description>

      <title>LLM+Reasoning+Planning for supporting incomplete user queries in presence of APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous LLM-based approaches aimed at providing natural language interfaces for various end-user tasks. These end-user tasks in turn can typically be accomplished by orchestrating a given set of APIs. In practice, natural language task requests (user queries) are often incomplete, i.e., they may not contain all the information required by the APIs. While LLMs excel at natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they frequently hallucinate on missing information or struggle with orchestrating the APIs. The key idea behind our proposed approach is to leverage logical reasoning and classical AI planning along with an LLM for accurately answering user queries including identification and gathering of any missing information in these queries. Our approach uses an LLM and ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to translate a user query to a representation in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) via an intermediate representation in ASP. We introduce a special API "get_info_api" for gathering missing information. We model all the APIs as PDDL actions in a way that supports dataflow between the APIs. Our approach then uses a classical AI planner to generate an orchestration of API calls (including calls to get_info_api) to answer the user query. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly outperforms a pure LLM based approach by achieving over 95\% success rate in most cases on a dataset containing complete and incomplete single goal and multi-goal queries where the multi-goal queries may or may not require dataflow among the APIs.</description>

      <title>WONDERBREAD: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Business Process Management Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing ML benchmarks lack the depth and diversity of annotations needed for evaluating models on business process management (BPM) tasks. BPM is the practice of documenting, measuring, improving, and automating enterprise workflows. However, research has focused almost exclusively on one task - full end-to-end automation using agents based on multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4. This focus on automation ignores the reality of how most BPM tools are applied today - simply documenting the relevant workflow takes 60% of the time of the typical process optimization project. To address this gap we present WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal FMs on BPM tasks beyond automation. Our contributions are: (1) a dataset containing 2928 documented workflow demonstrations; (2) 6 novel BPM tasks sourced from real-world applications ranging from workflow documentation to knowledge transfer to process improvement; and (3) an automated evaluation harness. Our benchmark shows that while state-of-the-art FMs can automatically generate documentation (e.g. recalling 88% of the steps taken in a video demonstration of a workflow), they struggle to re-apply that knowledge towards finer-grained validation of workflow completion (F1 &lt; 0.3). We hope WONDERBREAD encourages the development of more "human-centered" AI tooling for enterprise applications and furthers the exploration of multimodal FMs for the broader universe of BPM tasks. We publish our dataset and experiments here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/wonderbread</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society, involving complex interactions among multiple parties that require skills in social reasoning, negotiation, and long-term strategic planning. Previous AI agents have demonstrated their ability to handle multi-step games and large action spaces in multi-agent tasks. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. While recent agents based on large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in various applications, they still struggle with extended planning periods in complex multi-agent settings. Leveraging recent technologies for LLM-based agents, we aim to explore AI's potential to create a human-like agent capable of executing comprehensive multi-agent missions by integrating three fundamental capabilities: 1) strategic planning with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiation with social reasoning; and 3) augmenting memory through self-play games for self-evolution without human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Solving Robotics Problems in Zero-Shot with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) framework designed to solve robotics problems in a zero-shot regime. In our context, zero-shot means that for a novel environment, we provide a VLLM with an image of the robot's surroundings and a task description, and the VLLM outputs the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Unlike prior work that requires fine-tuning parts of the pipeline -- such as adjusting an LLM on robot-specific data or training separate vision encoders -- our approach demonstrates that with careful engineering, a single off-the-shelf VLLM can autonomously handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location extraction and action execution. Crucially, compared to using GPT-4o alone, Wonderful Team is self-corrective and capable of iteratively fixing its own mistakes, enabling it to solve challenging long-horizon tasks. We validate our framework through extensive experiments, both in simulated environments using VIMABench and in real-world settings. Our system showcases the ability to handle diverse tasks such as manipulation, goal-reaching, and visual reasoning -- all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year and should be strongly considered as a backbone for many robotics problems moving forward.</description>

      <title>How Diffusion Models Learn to Factorize and Compose</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which likely do not appear together in the training set, demonstrating the ability to \textit{compositionally generalize}. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Inspired by cognitive neuroscientific approaches, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether and when diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian bump images. We found that the models learn factorized but not fully continuous manifold representations for encoding continuous features of variation underlying the data. With such representations, models demonstrate superior feature compositionality but limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with few compositional examples, suggesting a more efficient way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, offering insight into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data.</description>

Abstract: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.</description>

      <title>On The Planning Abilities of OpenAI's o1 Models: Feasibility, Optimality, and Generalizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in planning remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the planning capabilities of OpenAI's o1 models across a variety of benchmark tasks, focusing on three key aspects: feasibility, optimality, and generalizability. Through empirical evaluations on constraint-heavy tasks (e.g., $\textit{Barman}$, $\textit{Tyreworld}$) and spatially complex environments (e.g., $\textit{Termes}$, $\textit{Floortile}$), we highlight o1-preview's strengths in self-evaluation and constraint-following, while also identifying bottlenecks in decision-making and memory management, particularly in tasks requiring robust spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that o1-preview outperforms GPT-4 in adhering to task constraints and managing state transitions in structured environments. However, the model often generates suboptimal solutions with redundant actions and struggles to generalize effectively in spatially complex tasks. This pilot study provides foundational insights into the planning limitations of LLMs, offering key directions for future research on improving memory management, decision-making, and generalization in LLM-based planning.

      <description>arXiv:2410.00689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As our world digitizes, web agents that can automate complex and monotonous tasks are becoming essential in streamlining workflows. This paper introduces an approach to improving web agent performance through multi-modal validation and self-refinement. We present a comprehensive study of different modalities (text, vision) and the effect of hierarchy for the automatic validation of web agents, building upon the state-of-the-art Agent-E web automation framework. We also introduce a self-refinement mechanism for web automation, using the developed auto-validator, that enables web agents to detect and self-correct workflow failures. Our results show significant gains on Agent-E's (a SOTA web agent) prior state-of-art performance, boosting task-completion rates from 76.2\% to 81.24\% on the subset of the WebVoyager benchmark. The approach presented in this paper paves the way for more reliable digital assistants in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or movement of nonrigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? It may involve specific attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscientific theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. We computationally test the hypothesis that the implementation of visual attention through neural synchrony underlies the ability of biological visual systems to track objects that change in appearance over time. We first introduce a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</description>

Abstract: Cognitive Architectures are the forefront of our research into developing an artificial cognition. However, they approach the problem from a separated memory and program model of computation. This model of computation poses a fundamental problem: the knowledge retrieval heuristic. In this paper we propose to solve this problem by using a new model of computation, one where the memory and the program are united: the Function-Representation. We propose a novel model of computation based on implementing and using these Function-Representations, and we explore its potential through mathematical definitions and proofs. We also talk about different ways to organise multiple Function-Representations, and explore the kind of functions that these Function-Representations can implement. Finally, we also explore the limitations of our proposal.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries that capture mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons (part of, e.g., transformers). Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable (NP-hard, $\Sigma^p_2$-hard), remain fixed-parameter intractable (W[1]-hard) when constraining model/circuit features (e.g., depth), and are inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems (NP- vs. $\Sigma^p_2$-complete) with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability (PTIME) or fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands among existing and future architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Correlated Equilibria in General-Sum Extensive-Form Games: Fixed-Parameter Algorithms, Hardness, and Two-Sided Column-Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding optimal correlated equilibria of various sorts in extensive-form games: normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE), extensive-form coarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE), and extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE). We make two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new algorithm for computing optimal equilibria in all three notions. Its runtime depends exponentially only on a parameter related to the information structure of the game. We also prove a fundamental complexity gap: while our size bounds for NFCCE are similar to those achieved in the case of team games by Zhang et al., this is impossible to achieve for the other two concepts under standard complexity assumptions. Second, we propose a two-sided column generation approach for use when the runtime or memory usage of the previous algorithm is prohibitive. Our algorithm improves upon the one-sided approach of Farina et al. by means of a new decomposition of correlated strategies which allows players to re-optimize their sequence-form strategies with respect to correlation plans which were previously added to the support. Experiments show that our techniques outperform the prior state of the art for computing optimal general-sum correlated equilibria.</description>

      <title>IP-FL: Incentivized and Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing incentive solutions for traditional Federated Learning (FL) focus on individual contributions to a single global objective, neglecting the nuances of clustered personalization with multiple cluster-level models and the non-monetary incentives such as personalized model appeal for clients. In this paper, we first propose to treat incentivization and personalization as interrelated challenges and solve them with an incentive mechanism that fosters personalized learning. Additionally, current methods depend on an aggregator for client clustering, which is limited by a lack of access to clients' confidential information due to privacy constraints, leading to inaccurate clustering. To overcome this, we propose direct client involvement, allowing clients to indicate their cluster membership preferences based on data distribution and incentive-driven feedback. Our approach enhances the personalized model appeal for self-aware clients with high-quality data leading to their active and consistent participation. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in test accuracy (8-45%), personalized model appeal (3-38%), and participation rates (31-100%) over existing FL models, including those addressing data heterogeneity and personalization.</description>

      <title>Standalone 16-bit Training: Missing Study for Hardware-Limited Deep Learning Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of machine learning models, managing computational resources like memory and processing power has become a critical concern. Mixed precision techniques, which leverage different numerical precisions during model training and inference to optimize resource usage, have been widely adopted. However, access to hardware that supports lower precision formats (e.g., FP8 or FP4) remains limited, especially for practitioners with hardware constraints. For many with limited resources, the available options are restricted to using 32-bit, 16-bit, or a combination of the two. While it is commonly believed that 16-bit precision can achieve results comparable to full (32-bit) precision, this study is the first to systematically validate this assumption through both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluation. Our theoretical formalization of floating-point errors and classification tolerance provides new insights into the conditions under which 16-bit precision can approximate 32-bit results. This study fills a critical gap, proving for the first time that standalone 16-bit precision neural networks match 32-bit and mixed-precision in accuracy while boosting computational speed. Given the widespread availability of 16-bit across GPUs, these findings are especially valuable for machine learning practitioners with limited hardware resources to make informed decisions.</description>

      <title>CDAN: Convolutional dense attention-guided network for low-light image enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light images, characterized by inadequate illumination, pose challenges of diminished clarity, muted colors, and reduced details. Low-light image enhancement, an essential task in computer vision, aims to rectify these issues by improving brightness, contrast, and overall perceptual quality, thereby facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces the Convolutional Dense Attention-guided Network (CDAN), a novel solution for enhancing low-light images. CDAN integrates an autoencoder-based architecture with convolutional and dense blocks, complemented by an attention mechanism and skip connections. This architecture ensures efficient information propagation and feature learning. Furthermore, a dedicated post-processing phase refines color balance and contrast. Our approach demonstrates notable progress compared to state-of-the-art results in low-light image enhancement, showcasing its robustness across a wide range of challenging scenarios. Our model performs remarkably on benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating under-exposure and proficiently restoring textures and colors in diverse low-light scenarios. This achievement underscores CDAN's potential for diverse computer vision tasks, notably enabling robust object detection and recognition in challenging low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors: Let the Embodied Agent Efficiently Learn on Its Own</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks. However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks. Visualizations and code are available at \url{https://yewr.github.io/rlfp}.</description>

      <title>Unlearning via Sparse Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine \emph{unlearning}, which involves erasing knowledge about a \emph{forget set} from a trained model, can prove to be costly and infeasible by existing techniques. We propose a nearly compute-free zero-shot unlearning technique based on a discrete representational bottleneck. We show that the proposed technique efficiently unlearns the forget set and incurs negligible damage to the model's performance on the rest of the data set. We evaluate the proposed technique on the problem of \textit{class unlearning} using three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and LACUNA-100. We compare the proposed technique to SCRUB, a state-of-the-art approach which uses knowledge distillation for unlearning. Across all three datasets, the proposed technique performs as well as, if not better than SCRUB while incurring almost no computational cost.</description>

      <title>Towards Difficulty-Agnostic Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable applicability across a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification. Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that combines visual prompts and text adapters with pre-trained VLMs, tailored by transfer difficulty, to achieve optimal performance for any target domain. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/}.</description>

      <title>Fusing Echocardiography Images and Medical Records for Continuous Patient Stratification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. Drawing on novel transformer models applied to tabular data, we propose a method that considers all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms to learn the representation of a cardiovascular pathology with a difficult-to-characterize continuum, namely hypertension. Our method first projects each variable into its own representation space using modality-specific approaches. These standardized representations of multimodal data are then fed to a transformer encoder, which learns to merge them into a comprehensive representation of the patient through the task of predicting a clinical rating. This stratification task is formulated as an ordinal classification to enforce a pathological continuum in the representation space. We observe the major trends along this continuum on a cohort of 239 hypertensive patients, providing unprecedented details in the description of hypertension's impact on various cardiac function descriptors. Our analysis shows that i) the XTab foundation model's architecture allows to reach outstanding performance (98% AUROC) even with limited data (less than 200 training samples), ii) stratification across the population is reproducible between trainings (within 3.6% MAE), and iii) patterns emerge in descriptors, some of which align with established physiological knowledge about hypertension, while others could pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of this pathology.</description>

Abstract: We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method, termed as Agent Forest, is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence.

      <title>Exploiting Estimation Bias in Clipped Double Q-Learning for Continous Control Reinforcement Learning Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous control Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are known to suffer from estimation biases, leading to suboptimal policies. This paper introduces innovative methods in RL, focusing on addressing and exploiting estimation biases in Actor-Critic methods for continuous control tasks, using Deep Double Q-Learning. We design a Bias Exploiting (BE) mechanism to dynamically select the most advantageous estimation bias during training of the RL agent. Most State-of-the-art Deep RL algorithms can be equipped with the BE mechanism, without hindering performance or computational complexity. Our extensive experiments across various continuous control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. We show that RL algorithms equipped with this method can match or surpass their counterparts, particularly in environments where estimation biases significantly impact learning. The results underline the importance of bias exploitation in improving policy learning in RL.</description>

      <title>I Learn Better If You Speak My Language: Understanding the Superior Performance of Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with LLM-Generated Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.</description>

      <title>SPRINQL: Sub-optimal Demonstrations driven Offline Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on offline imitation learning (IL), which aims to mimic an expert's behavior using demonstrations without any interaction with the environment. One of the main challenges in offline IL is the limited support of expert demonstrations, which typically cover only a small fraction of the state-action space. While it may not be feasible to obtain numerous expert demonstrations, it is often possible to gather a larger set of sub-optimal demonstrations. For example, in treatment optimization problems, there are varying levels of doctor treatments available for different chronic conditions. These range from treatment specialists and experienced general practitioners to less experienced general practitioners. Similarly, when robots are trained to imitate humans in routine tasks, they might learn from individuals with different levels of expertise and efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose an offline IL approach that leverages the larger set of sub-optimal demonstrations while effectively mimicking expert trajectories. Existing offline IL methods based on behavior cloning or distribution matching often face issues such as overfitting to the limited set of expert demonstrations or inadvertently imitating sub-optimal trajectories from the larger dataset. Our approach, which is based on inverse soft-Q learning, learns from both expert and sub-optimal demonstrations. It assigns higher importance (through learned weights) to aligning with expert demonstrations and lower importance to aligning with sub-optimal ones. A key contribution of our approach, called SPRINQL, is transforming the offline IL problem into a convex optimization over the space of Q functions. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the SPRINQL algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on offline IL benchmarks.

      <title>Mitigating the Linguistic Gap with Phonemic Representations for Robust Cross-lingual Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaches to improving multilingual language understanding often struggle with significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages. While there are efforts to align the languages in a single latent space to mitigate such gaps, how different input-level representations influence such gaps has not been investigated, particularly with phonemic inputs. We hypothesize that the performance gaps are affected by representation discrepancies between these languages, and revisit the use of phonemic representations as a means to mitigate these discrepancies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, we present experiments on three representative cross-lingual tasks on 12 languages in total. The results show that phonemic representations exhibit higher similarities between languages compared to orthographic representations, and it consistently outperforms grapheme-based baseline model on languages that are relatively low-resourced. We present quantitative evidence from three cross-lingual tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, and it is further justified by a theoretical analysis of the cross-lingual performance gap.</description>

      <title>Controllable Preference Optimization: Toward Controllable Multi-Objective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving improvements in multi-objective alignment.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Adaptation of Segmentation Foundation Model via Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of tasks have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments (e.g., task-specific adaptation for out-of-distribution objects) not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-specific adaptation (i.e., customization) of the segmentation foundation model via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with peculiarities of the target task, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Why Label Smoothing Degrades Selective Classification and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label smoothing (LS) is a popular regularisation method for training neural networks as it is effective in improving test accuracy and is simple to implement. Hard one-hot labels are smoothed by uniformly distributing probability mass to other classes, reducing overfitting. Prior work has suggested that in some cases LS can degrade selective classification (SC) -- where the aim is to reject misclassifications using a model's uncertainty. In this work, we first demonstrate empirically across an extended range of large-scale tasks and architectures that LS consistently degrades SC. We then address a gap in existing knowledge, providing an explanation for this behaviour by analysing logit-level gradients: LS degrades the uncertainty rank ordering of correct vs incorrect predictions by regularising the max logit more when a prediction is likely to be correct, and less when it is likely to be wrong. This elucidates previously reported experimental results where strong classifiers underperform in SC. We then demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of post-hoc logit normalisation for recovering lost SC performance caused by LS. Furthermore, linking back to our gradient analysis, we again provide an explanation for why such normalisation is effective.</description>

      <title>Negative Preference Optimization: From Catastrophic Collapse to Effective Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often memorize sensitive, private, or copyrighted data during pre-training. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse -- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities.
  In this paper, we propose Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish. Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10% of training data.</description>

      <title>Scaling Instructable Agents Across Many Simulated Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</description>

      <title>Food Portion Estimation via 3D Object Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-based methods to analyze food images have alleviated the user burden and biases associated with traditional methods. However, accurate portion estimation remains a major challenge due to the loss of 3D information in the 2D representation of foods captured by smartphone cameras or wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a new framework to estimate both food volume and energy from 2D images by leveraging the power of 3D food models and physical reference in the eating scene. Our method estimates the pose of the camera and the food object in the input image and recreates the eating occasion by rendering an image of a 3D model of the food with the estimated poses. We also introduce a new dataset, SimpleFood45, which contains 2D images of 45 food items and associated annotations including food volume, weight, and energy. Our method achieves an average error of 31.10 kCal (17.67%) on this dataset, outperforming existing portion estimation methods. The dataset can be accessed at: https://lorenz.ecn.purdue.edu/~gvinod/simplefood45/ and the code can be accessed at: https://gitlab.com/viper-purdue/monocular-food-volume-3d</description>

      <title>Influence of Solution Efficiency and Valence of Instruction on Additive and Subtractive Solution Strategies in Humans and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligences, especially large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being used, necessitating transparency about their capabilities. While prior studies have shown addition biases in humans (Adams et al., 2021) and OpenAI's GPT-3 (Winter et al., 2023), this study extends the research by comparing human and GPT-4 problem-solving across both spatial and linguistic tasks, with variations in solution efficiency and valence of task instruction. Four preregistered experiments with 588 participants from the U.S. and 680 GPT-4 iterations revealed a stronger tendency towards additive transformations in GPT-4 than in humans. Human participants were less likely to use additive strategies when subtraction was relatively more efficient than when addition and subtraction were equally efficient. GPT-4 exhibited the opposite behavior, with a strong addition bias when subtraction was more efficient. In terms of valence of task instruction, GPT-4's use of additive strategies increased when instructed to "improve" (positive valence) rather than "edit" (neutral valence). These findings demonstrate that biases in human problem-solving are amplified in the outputs of GPT-4, and that LLM's solution strategies differ from human efficiency-based strategies. This highlights the evolving limitations of LLMs and the need for caution when using them in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Automating Data Annotation under Strategic Human Agents: Risks and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in social domains to make consequential decisions about humans, they often have the power to reshape data distributions. Humans, as strategic agents, continuously adapt their behaviors in response to the learning system. As populations change dynamically, ML systems may need frequent updates to ensure high performance. However, acquiring high-quality human-annotated samples can be highly challenging and even infeasible in social domains. A common practice to address this issue is using the model itself to annotate unlabeled data samples. This paper investigates the long-term impacts when ML models are retrained with model-annotated samples when they incorporate human strategic responses. We first formalize the interactions between strategic agents and the model and then analyze how they evolve under such dynamic interactions. We find that agents are increasingly likely to receive positive decisions as the model gets retrained, whereas the proportion of agents with positive labels may decrease over time. We thus propose a refined retraining process to stabilize the dynamics. Last, we examine how algorithmic fairness can be affected by these retraining processes and find that enforcing common fairness constraints at every round may not benefit the disadvantaged group in the long run. Experiments on (semi-)synthetic and real data validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>ART: Automatic Red-teaming for Text-to-Image Models to Protect Benign Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained generative models are taking the world by storm, due to their abilities in generating creative content. Meanwhile, safeguards for these generative models are developed, to protect users' rights and safety, most of which are designed for large language models. Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreak and adversarial attacks, which mainly evaluate the model's safety under malicious prompts. Recent work found that manually crafted safe prompts can unintentionally trigger unsafe generations. To further systematically evaluate the safety risks of text-to-image models, we propose a novel Automatic Red-Teaming framework, ART. Our method leverages both vision language model and large language model to establish a connection between unsafe generations and their prompts, thereby more efficiently identifying the model's vulnerabilities. With our comprehensive experiments, we reveal the toxicity of the popular open-source text-to-image models. The experiments also validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and great diversity of ART. Additionally, we introduce three large-scale red-teaming datasets for studying the safety risks associated with text-to-image models. Datasets and models can be found in https://github.com/GuanlinLee/ART.</description>

      <title>Efficient Systematic Reviews: Literature Filtering with Transformers &amp; Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying critical research within the growing body of academic work is an intrinsic aspect of conducting quality research. Systematic review processes used in evidence-based medicine formalise this as a procedure that must be followed in a research program. However, it comes with an increasing burden in terms of the time required to identify the important articles of research for a given topic. In this work, we develop a method for building a general-purpose filtering system that matches a research question, posed as a natural language description of the required content, against a candidate set of articles obtained via the application of broad search terms. Our results demonstrate that transformer models, pre-trained on biomedical literature, and then fine tuned for the specific task, offer a promising solution to this problem. The model can remove large volumes of irrelevant articles for most research questions. Furthermore, analysis of the specific research questions in our training data suggest natural avenues for further improvement.</description>

      <title>FREA: Feasibility-Guided Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios with Reasonable Adversariality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are essential yet difficult to collect at scale, offers an effective method to evaluate the robustness of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches. However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions. In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure the reasonableness of the adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial policy that controls the scene's critical background vehicles (CBVs) to generate adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent adversarial objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring AV's feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Streaming Diffusion Policy: Fast Policy Synthesis with Variable Noise Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have seen rapid adoption in robotic imitation learning, enabling autonomous execution of complex dexterous tasks. However, action synthesis is often slow, requiring many steps of iterative denoising, limiting the extent to which models can be used in tasks that require fast reactive policies. To sidestep this, recent works have explored how the distillation of the diffusion process can be used to accelerate policy synthesis. However, distillation is computationally expensive and can hurt both the accuracy and diversity of synthesized actions. We propose SDP (Streaming Diffusion Policy), an alternative method to accelerate policy synthesis, leveraging the insight that generating a partially denoised action trajectory is substantially faster than a full output action trajectory. At each observation, our approach outputs a partially denoised action trajectory with variable levels of noise corruption, where the immediate action to execute is noise-free, with subsequent actions having increasing levels of noise and uncertainty. The partially denoised action trajectory for a new observation can then be quickly generated by applying a few steps of denoising to the previously predicted noisy action trajectory (rolled over by one timestep). We illustrate the efficacy of this approach, dramatically speeding up policy synthesis while preserving performance across both simulated and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</description>

      <title>JavaBench: A Benchmark of Object-Oriented Code Generation for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate LLMs' capabilities. However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we noticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language. 95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java. Second, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks account for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to class-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced features. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while overlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).
  To fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that exercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in 106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by 282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass rate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code skeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM's capability against JavaBench, we introduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and five synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical metrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First, we noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind undergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied LLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using method signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-level code generation. JavaBench is publicly available at https://github.com/java-bench/JavaBench.</description>

      <title>PostMark: A Robust Blackbox Watermark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most effective techniques to detect LLM-generated text rely on inserting a detectable signature -- or watermark -- during the model's decoding process. Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM's logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation. As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider. In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed. Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party. We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human assessments, highlighting the trade-off between quality and robustness to paraphrasing. We release our code, outputs, and annotations at https://github.com/lilakk/PostMark.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Bias into Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-conditional diffusion models, i.e. text-to-image, produce eye-catching images that represent descriptions given by a user. These images often depict benign concepts but could also carry other purposes. Specifically, visual information is easy to comprehend and could be weaponized for propaganda -- a serious challenge given widespread usage and deployment of generative models. In this paper, we show that an adversary can add an arbitrary bias through a backdoor attack that would affect even benign users generating images. While a user could inspect a generated image to comply with the given text description, our attack remains stealthy as it preserves semantic information given in the text prompt. Instead, a compromised model modifies other unspecified features of the image to add desired biases (that increase by 4-8x). Furthermore, we show how the current state-of-the-art generative models make this attack both cheap and feasible for any adversary, with costs ranging between $12-$18. We evaluate our attack over various types of triggers, adversary objectives, and biases and discuss mitigations and future work.

      <title>Decoupling General and Personalized Knowledge in Federated Learning via Additive and Low-Rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address data heterogeneity, the key strategy of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is to decouple general knowledge (shared among clients) and client-specific knowledge, as the latter can have a negative impact on collaboration if not removed. Existing PFL methods primarily adopt a parameter partitioning approach, where the parameters of a model are designated as one of two types: parameters shared with other clients to extract general knowledge and parameters retained locally to learn client-specific knowledge. However, as these two types of parameters are put together like a jigsaw puzzle into a single model during the training process, each parameter may simultaneously absorb both general and client-specific knowledge, thus struggling to separate the two types of knowledge effectively. In this paper, we introduce FedDecomp, a simple but effective PFL paradigm that employs parameter additive decomposition to address this issue. Instead of assigning each parameter of a model as either a shared or personalized one, FedDecomp decomposes each parameter into the sum of two parameters: a shared one and a personalized one, thus achieving a more thorough decoupling of shared and personalized knowledge compared to the parameter partitioning method. In addition, as we find that retaining local knowledge of specific clients requires much lower model capacity compared with general knowledge across all clients, we let the matrix containing personalized parameters be low rank during the training process. Moreover, a new alternating training strategy is proposed to further improve the performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets and varying degrees of data heterogeneity demonstrate that FedDecomp outperforms state-of-the-art methods up to 4.9\%.

      <title>From the Least to the Most: Building a Plug-and-Play Visual Reasoner via Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore multi-step reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). The problem is challenging, as reasoning data consisting of multiple steps of visual and language processing are barely available. To overcome the challenge, we first introduce a least-to-most visual reasoning paradigm, which interleaves steps of decomposing a question into sub-questions and invoking external tools for resolving sub-questions. Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct $50$k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised fine-tuning, which is capable of generally enhancing the reasoning abilities of a wide range of existing VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments indicate that the visual reasoner can consistently and significantly improve four VLMs on four VQA benchmarks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/steven-ccq/VisualReasoner.</description>

      <title>MetaUrban: An Embodied AI Simulation Platform for Urban Micromobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Spectra: Surprising Effectiveness of Pretraining Ternary Language Models at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12327v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in GPU computational power has outpaced memory capacity and bandwidth growth, creating bottlenecks in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the feasibility and scalability of low-bitwidth language models, paving the way for the development of more efficient LLMs.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite.</description>

      <title>Robots Can Multitask Too: Integrating a Memory Architecture and LLMs for Enhanced Cross-Task Robot Action Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been recently used in robot applications for grounding LLM common-sense reasoning with the robot's perception and physical abilities. In humanoid robots, memory also plays a critical role in fostering real-world embodiment and facilitating long-term interactive capabilities, especially in multi-task setups where the robot must remember previous task states, environment states, and executed actions. In this paper, we address incorporating memory processes with LLMs for generating cross-task robot actions, while the robot effectively switches between tasks. Our proposed dual-layered architecture features two LLMs, utilizing their complementary skills of reasoning and following instructions, combined with a memory model inspired by human cognition. Our results show a significant improvement in performance over a baseline of five robotic tasks, demonstrating the potential of integrating memory with LLMs for combining the robot's action and perception for adaptive task execution.</description>

      <title>SOAP-RL: Sequential Option Advantage Propagation for Reinforcement Learning in POMDP Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work compares ways of extending Reinforcement Learning algorithms to Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with options. One view of options is as temporally extended action, which can be realized as a memory that allows the agent to retain historical information beyond the policy's context window. While option assignment could be handled using heuristics and hand-crafted objectives, learning temporally consistent options and associated sub-policies without explicit supervision is a challenge. Two algorithms, PPOEM and SOAP, are proposed and studied in depth to address this problem. PPOEM applies the forward-backward algorithm (for Hidden Markov Models) to optimize the expected returns for an option-augmented policy. However, this learning approach is unstable during on-policy rollouts. It is also unsuited for learning causal policies without the knowledge of future trajectories, since option assignments are optimized for offline sequences where the entire episode is available. As an alternative approach, SOAP evaluates the policy gradient for an optimal option assignment. It extends the concept of the generalized advantage estimation (GAE) to propagate option advantages through time, which is an analytical equivalent to performing temporal back-propagation of option policy gradients. This option policy is only conditional on the history of the agent, not future actions. Evaluated against competing baselines, SOAP exhibited the most robust performance, correctly discovering options for POMDP corridor environments, as well as on standard benchmarks including Atari and MuJoCo, outperforming PPOEM, as well as LSTM and Option-Critic baselines. The open-sourced code is available at https://github.com/shuishida/SoapRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial for building trust among AI and users. Incorporating reasoning capabilities enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand emotions in context, handle nuanced language, and infer unstated sentiments. In this work, we introduce a new task -- Sentiment Reasoning -- for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model performance (1% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Medicine with Iterative Follow-up Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in solving medical questions. They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a conventional RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with conventional RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG. The implementation of i-MedRAG is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/MedRAG.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of state-based potential games for process optimization in decentralized manufacturing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.</description>

      <title>SSL-TTS: Leveraging Self-Supervised Embeddings and kNN Retrieval for Zero-Shot Multi-speaker TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent zero-shot multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. It was also observed that SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity, which enables straight-forward and robust voice cloning. In this study, we introduce SSL-TTS, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot TTS framework trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker. SSL-TTS leverages SSL features and retrieval methods for simple and robust zero-shot multi-speaker synthesis. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that require significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that SSL-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine control over the output speech by blending voices. Demo samples are available at https://idiap.github.io/ssl-tts</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence in Geo-Localization: A Multi-Agent Large Vision-Language Model Collaborative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual geo-localization demands in-depth knowledge and advanced reasoning skills to associate images with real-world geographic locations precisely. In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce smileGeo, a novel visual geo-localization framework that leverages multiple Internet-enabled LVLM agents operating within an agent-based architecture. By facilitating inter-agent communication, smileGeo integrates the inherent knowledge of these agents with additional retrieved information, enhancing the ability to effectively localize images. Additionally, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy that optimizes communication among agents, minimizing redundant interactions and improving overall system efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Wait, that's not an option: LLMs Robustness with Incorrect Multiple-Choice Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making under full alignment requires balancing between reasoning and faithfulness - a challenge for large language models (LLMs). This study explores whether LLMs prioritize following instructions over reasoning and truth when given "misleading" instructions, such as "Respond solely with A or B", even when neither option is correct. We introduce a new metric called "reflective judgment", which sheds new light on the relationship between the pre-training and post-training alignment schemes. In tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to domain-specific assessments, models like GPT-4o, o1-mini, or Claude 3 Opus adhered to instructions correctly but failed to reflect on the validity of the provided options. Contrary, models from the Llama 3.1 family (8B, 70B, 405B) or base Qwen2.5 (7B, 14B, 32B) families exhibit improved refusal rates with size, indicating a scaling effect. We also observed that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance reasoning, sometimes weakened the models' ability to reject incorrect instructions, leading them to follow flawed prompts uncritically. Finally, we have also conducted a parallel human study revealing similar patterns in human behavior and annotations. We highlight how popular RLHF datasets might disrupt either training or evaluation due to annotations exhibiting poor reflective judgement.</description>

      <title>LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a statement; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.</description>

      <title>MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are usually grouped as autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. The autoregressive systems implicitly model duration but exhibit certain deficiencies in robustness and lack of duration controllability. Non-autoregressive systems require explicit alignment information between text and speech during training and predict durations for linguistic units (e.g. phone), which may compromise their naturalness. In this paper, we introduce Masked Generative Codec Transformer (MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive TTS model that eliminates the need for explicit alignment information between text and speech supervision, as well as phone-level duration prediction. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first stage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech self-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model predicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows the mask-and-predict learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to predict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and prompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in a parallel manner. Experiments with 100K hours of in-the-wild speech demonstrate that MaskGCT outperforms the current state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in terms of quality, similarity, and intelligibility.

      <title>FMRFT: Fusion Mamba and DETR for Query Time Sequence Intersection Fish Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of abnormal fish behavior caused by disease or hunger can be achieved through fish tracking using deep learning techniques, which holds significant value for industrial aquaculture. However, underwater reflections and some reasons with fish, such as the high similarity, rapid swimming caused by stimuli and mutual occlusion bring challenges to multi-target tracking of fish. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a complex multi-scenario sturgeon tracking dataset and introduces the FMRFT model, a real-time end-to-end fish tracking solution. The model incorporates the low video memory consumption Mamba In Mamba (MIM) architecture, which facilitates multi-frame temporal memory and feature extraction, thereby addressing the challenges to track multiple fish across frames. Additionally, the FMRFT model with the Query Time Sequence Intersection (QTSI) module effectively manages occluded objects and reduces redundant tracking frames using the superior feature interaction and prior frame processing capabilities of RT-DETR. This combination significantly enhances the accuracy and stability of fish tracking. Trained and tested on the dataset, the model achieves an IDF1 score of 90.3% and a MOTA accuracy of 94.3%. Experimental results show that the proposed FMRFT model effectively addresses the challenges of high similarity and mutual occlusion in fish populations, enabling accurate tracking in factory farming environments.</description>

      <title>Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-based Approach Towards Traceable Behavior Specifications in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in a German legal context with two example scenarios and evaluate our results. Our evaluation shows that the explicit documentation of assumptions in the behavior specification supports both the identification of specification insufficiencies and their treatment. Therefore, this article provides requirements, terminology and an according methodology to facilitate ontology-based behavior specifications in automated driving.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Active Tactile Object Recognition, Pose Estimation and Shape Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As humans can explore and understand the world through active touch, similar capability is desired for robots. In this paper, we address the problem of active tactile object recognition, pose estimation and shape transfer learning, where a customized particle filter (PF) and Gaussian process implicit surface (GPIS) is combined in a unified Bayesian framework. Upon new tactile input, the customized PF updates the joint distribution of the object class and object pose while tracking the novelty of the object. Once a novel object is identified, its shape will be reconstructed using GPIS. By grounding the prior of the GPIS with the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation from the PF, the knowledge about known shapes can be transferred to learn novel shapes. An exploration procedure based on global shape estimation is proposed to guide active data acquisition and terminate the exploration upon sufficient information. Through experiments in simulation, the proposed framework demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency in estimating object class and pose for known objects and learning novel shapes. Furthermore, it can recognize previously learned shapes reliably.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Periorbital Distance Prediction and Disease Classification Using Periorbital Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periorbital distances and features around the eyes and lids hold valuable information for disease quantification and monitoring of surgical and medical intervention. These distances are commonly measured manually, a process that is both subjective and highly time-consuming. Here, we set out to developed three deep-learning methods for segmentation and periorbital distance prediction, and also evaluate the utility of periorbital distances for disease classification. The MAE of our deep learning predicted distances was less than or very close to the error observed between trained human annotators. We compared our models to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for periorbital distance prediction and found that our methods outperformed SOTA on all of our datasets on all but one periorbital measurement. We also show that robust segmentation can be achieved on diseased eyes using models trained on open-source, healthy eyes, and that periorbital distances have can be used as high-quality features in downstream classification models. Leveraging segmentation networks as intermediary steps in classification has broad implications for increasing the generalizability of classification models in ophthalmic plastic and craniofacial surgery by avoiding the out-of-distribution problem observed in traditional convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompts: Dynamic Conversational Benchmarking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks, which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks have heretofore not been able to capture.</description>

      <title>KnobGen: Controlling the Sophistication of Artwork in Sketch-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Contrastive Monte Carlo Tree Search Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS's reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement. We outperformed o1-mini by an average of 17.4% on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B with SC-MCTS*.

      <title>CAnDOIT: Causal Discovery with Observational and Interventional Data from Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of cause-and-effect is of the utmost importance in many branches of science, but also for many practical applications of intelligent systems. In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This paper proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT has also been developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow.</description>

      <title>A Brain-Inspired Regularizer for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in many visual tasks, but they tend to be sensitive to slight input perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye, often resulting in task failures. Recent studies indicate that training CNNs with regularizers that promote brain-like representations, using neural recordings, can improve model robustness. However, the requirement to use neural data severely restricts the utility of these methods. Is it possible to develop regularizers that mimic the computational function of neural regularizers without the need for neural recordings, thereby expanding the usability and effectiveness of these techniques? In this work, we inspect a neural regularizer introduced in Li et al. (2019) to extract its underlying strength. The regularizer uses neural representational similarities, which we find also correlate with pixel similarities. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a new regularizer that retains the essence of the original but is computed using image pixel similarities, eliminating the need for neural recordings. We show that our regularization method 1) significantly increases model robustness to a range of black box attacks on various datasets and 2) is computationally inexpensive and relies only on original datasets. Our work explores how biologically motivated loss functions can be used to drive the performance of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Regional Primitives for Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to explain the internal representation structure of a neural network for image generation. Specifically, our method disentangles primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer feature of the neural network, which ensures that each feature component is exclusively used to generate a specific set of image regions. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be considered as the superposition of different pre-encoded primitive regional patterns, each being generated by a feature component. We find that the feature component can be represented as an OR relationship between the demands for generating different image regions, which is encoded by the neural network. Therefore, we extend the Harsanyi interaction to represent such an OR interaction to disentangle the feature component. Experiments show a clear correspondence between each feature component and the generation of specific image regions.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Approximating Redundant Computational Blocks in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn similar internal representations, both across different models and within their own layers. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities present new opportunities for designing more efficient architectures. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of these internal similarities across different layers in diverse neural architectures, showing that similarity patterns emerge independently of the datataset used. We introduce a simple metric, Block Redundancy, to detect redundant blocks, providing a foundation for future architectural optimization methods. Building on this, we propose Redundant Blocks Approximation (RBA), a general framework that identifies and approximates one or more redundant computational blocks using simpler transformations. We show that the transformation $\mathcal{T}$ between two representations can be efficiently computed in closed-form, and it is enough to replace the redundant blocks from the network. RBA reduces model parameters and time complexity while maintaining good performance. We validate our method on classification tasks in the vision domain using a variety of pretrained foundational models and datasets.</description>

      <title>VLM2Vec: Training Vision-Language Models for Massive Multimodal Embedding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite their importance. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -&gt; Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on Phi-3.5-V and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances of Multimodal Continual Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to empower machine learning models to learn continually from new data, while building upon previously acquired knowledge without forgetting. As machine learning models have evolved from small to large pre-trained architectures, and from supporting unimodal to multimodal data, multimodal continual learning (MMCL) methods have recently emerged. The primary challenge of MMCL is that it goes beyond a simple stacking of unimodal CL methods, as such straightforward approaches often yield unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survey on MMCL. We provide essential background knowledge and MMCL settings, as well as a structured taxonomy of MMCL methods. We categorize existing MMCL methods into four categories, i.e., regularization-based, architecture-based, replay-based, and prompt-based methods, explaining their methodologies and highlighting their key innovations. Additionally, to prompt further research in this field, we summarize open MMCL datasets and benchmarks, and discuss several promising future directions for investigation and development. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant MMCL papers and open resources available at https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning.</description>

      <title>T2V-Turbo-v2: Enhancing Video Generation Model Post-Training through Data, Reward, and Conditional Guidance Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.</description>

      <title>Block Induced Signature Generative Adversarial Network (BISGAN): Signature Spoofing Using GANs and Their Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is actively being used in biometrics to develop efficient identification and verification systems. Handwritten signatures are a common subset of biometric data for authentication purposes. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn from original and forged signatures to generate forged signatures. While most GAN techniques create a strong signature verifier, which is the discriminator, there is a need to focus more on the quality of forgeries generated by the generator model. This work focuses on creating a generator that produces forged samples that achieve a benchmark in spoofing signature verification systems. We use CycleGANs infused with Inception model-like blocks with attention heads as the generator and a variation of the SigCNN model as the base Discriminator. We train our model with a new technique that results in 80% to 100% success in signature spoofing. Additionally, we create a custom evaluation technique to act as a goodness measure of the generated forgeries. Our work advocates generator-focused GAN architectures for spoofing data quality that aid in a better understanding of biometric data generation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Chip-Tuning: Classify Before Language Models Say</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development in the performance of large language models (LLMs) is accompanied by the escalation of model size, leading to the increasing cost of model training and inference. Previous research has discovered that certain layers in LLMs exhibit redundancy, and removing these layers brings only marginal loss in model performance. In this paper, we adopt the probing technique to explain the layer redundancy in LLMs and demonstrate that language models can be effectively pruned with probing classifiers. We propose chip-tuning, a simple and effective structured pruning framework specialized for classification problems. Chip-tuning attaches tiny probing classifiers named chips to different layers of LLMs, and trains chips with the backbone model frozen. After selecting a chip for classification, all layers subsequent to the attached layer could be removed with marginal performance loss. Experimental results on various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that chip-tuning significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and pruning ratio, achieving a pruning ratio of up to 50%. We also find that chip-tuning could be applied on multimodal models, and could be combined with model finetuning, proving its excellent compatibility.</description>

      <title>ELMO: Enhanced Real-time LiDAR Motion Capture through Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research.

      <title>DA-Code: Agent Data Science Code Generation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DA-Code, a code generation benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs on agent-based data science tasks. This benchmark features three core elements: First, the tasks within DA-Code are inherently challenging, setting them apart from traditional code generation tasks and demanding advanced coding skills in grounding and planning. Second, examples in DA-Code are all based on real and diverse data, covering a wide range of complex data wrangling and analytics tasks. Third, to solve the tasks, the models must utilize complex data science programming languages, to perform intricate data processing and derive the answers. We set up the benchmark in a controllable and executable environment that aligns with real-world data analysis scenarios and is scalable. The annotators meticulously design the evaluation suite to ensure the accuracy and robustness of the evaluation. We develop the DA-Agent baseline. Experiments show that although the baseline performs better than other existing frameworks, using the current best LLMs achieves only 30.5% accuracy, leaving ample room for improvement. We release our benchmark at https://da-code-bench.github.io.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Safety-enhanced Aligned LLM Fine-tuning via Bilevel Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific data to boost downstream performance is a crucial step for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). However, previous studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning the models on several adversarial samples or even benign data can greatly comprise the model's pre-equipped alignment and safety capabilities. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel framework to enhance safety in LLM fine-tuning. SEAL learns a data ranker based on the bilevel optimization to up rank the safe and high-quality fine-tuning data and down rank the unsafe or low-quality ones. Models trained with SEAL demonstrate superior quality over multiple baselines, with 8.5% and 9.7% win rate increase compared to random selection respectively on Llama-3-8b-Instruct and Merlinite-7b models. Our code is available on github https://github.com/hanshen95/SEAL.</description>

      <title>Mastering Contact-rich Tasks by Combining Soft and Rigid Robotics with Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robots have the potential to revolutionize the use of robotic systems with their capability of establishing safe, robust, and adaptable interactions with their environment, but their precise control remains challenging. In contrast, traditional rigid robots offer high accuracy and repeatability but lack the flexibility of soft robots. We argue that combining these characteristics in a hybrid robotic platform can significantly enhance overall capabilities. This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</description>

      <title>ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks.
  To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights.
  This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</description>

      <title>Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

      <title>SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.
