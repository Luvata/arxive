      <title>Generating Causal Explanations of Vehicular Agent Behavioural Interactions with Learnt Reward Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparency and explainability are important features that responsible autonomous vehicles should possess, particularly when interacting with humans, and causal reasoning offers a strong basis to provide these qualities. However, even if one assumes agents act to maximise some concept of reward, it is difficult to make accurate causal inferences of agent planning without capturing what is of importance to the agent. Thus our work aims to learn a weighting of reward metrics for agents such that explanations for agent interactions can be causally inferred. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively across three real-world driving datasets, demonstrating a functional improvement over previous methods and competitive performance across evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Behaviour Discovery and Attribution for Explainable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the decisions made by reinforcement learning (RL) agents is critical for building trust and ensuring reliability in real-world applications. Traditional approaches to explainability often rely on saliency analysis, which can be limited in providing actionable insights. Recently, there has been growing interest in attributing RL decisions to specific trajectories within a dataset. However, these methods often generalize explanations to long trajectories, potentially involving multiple distinct behaviors. Often, providing multiple more fine grained explanations would improve clarity. In this work, we propose a framework for behavior discovery and action attribution to behaviors in offline RL trajectories. Our method identifies meaningful behavioral segments, enabling more precise and granular explanations associated with high level agent behaviors. This approach is adaptable across diverse environments with minimal modifications, offering a scalable and versatile solution for behavior discovery and attribution for explainable RL.</description>

      <title>GraspCorrect: Robotic Grasp Correction via Vision-Language Model-Guided Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in robotic manipulation, achieving consistent and stable grasping remains a fundamental challenge, often limiting the successful execution of complex tasks. Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art policy models frequently exhibit unstable grasping behaviors, leading to failure cases that create bottlenecks in real-world robotic applications. To address these challenges, we introduce GraspCorrect, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance grasp performance through vision-language model-guided feedback. GraspCorrect employs an iterative visual question-answering framework with two key components: grasp-guided prompting, which incorporates task-specific constraints, and object-aware sampling, which ensures the selection of physically feasible grasp candidates. By iteratively generating intermediate visual goals and translating them into joint-level actions, GraspCorrect significantly improves grasp stability and consistently enhances task success rates across existing policy models in the RLBench and CALVIN datasets.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Effort and Problem Complexity: A Scaling Analysis in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities, and recent advances in training paradigms have led to breakthroughs in their reasoning performance. In this work, we investigate how the reasoning effort of such models scales with problem complexity. We use the infinitely scalable Tents puzzle, which has a known linear-time solution, to analyze this scaling behavior. Our results show that reasoning effort scales with problem size, but only up to a critical problem complexity. Beyond this threshold, the reasoning effort does not continue to increase, and may even decrease. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the logical coherence of current LLMs as problem complexity increases, and underscores the need for strategies to improve reasoning scalability. Furthermore, our results reveal significant performance differences between current state-of-the-art reasoning models when faced with increasingly complex logical puzzles.</description>

      <title>Aligning Crowd-sourced Human Feedback for Reinforcement Learning on Code Generation by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how AI-assisted programming and large language models (LLM) improve software developers' ability via AI tools (LLM agents) like Github Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, while integrating human feedback to enhance reinforcement learning (RLHF) with crowd-sourced computation to enhance text-to-code generation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our Bayesian optimization framework supports AI alignment in code generation by distributing the feedback collection burden, highlighting the value of collecting human feedback of good quality. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing how LLM agents can be effectively trained for improved text-to-code generation. Our Bayesian optimization framework can be designed for general domain-specific languages, promoting the alignment of large language model capabilities with human feedback in AI-assisted programming for code generation.</description>

      <title>World Models in Artificial Intelligence: Sensing, Learning, and Reasoning Like a Child</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World Models help Artificial Intelligence (AI) predict outcomes, reason about its environment, and guide decision-making. While widely used in reinforcement learning, they lack the structured, adaptive representations that even young children intuitively develop. Advancing beyond pattern recognition requires dynamic, interpretable frameworks inspired by Piaget's cognitive development theory. We highlight six key research areas -- physics-informed learning, neurosymbolic learning, continual learning, causal inference, human-in-the-loop AI, and responsible AI -- as essential for enabling true reasoning in AI. By integrating statistical learning with advances in these areas, AI can evolve from pattern recognition to genuine understanding, adaptation and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Do Chains-of-Thoughts of Large Language Models Suffer from Hallucinations, Cognitive Biases, or Phobias in Bayesian Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to reason and carefully explain arguments is central to students' cognitive, mathematical, and computational thinking development. This is particularly challenging in problems under uncertainty and in Bayesian reasoning. With the new generation of large language models (LLMs) capable of reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT), there is an excellent opportunity to learn with them as they explain their reasoning through a dialogue with their artificial internal voice. It is an engaging and excellent opportunity to learn Bayesian reasoning. Furthermore, given that different LLMs sometimes arrive at opposite solutions, CoT generates opportunities for deep learning by detailed comparisons of reasonings. However, unlike humans, we found that they do not autonomously explain using ecologically valid strategies like natural frequencies, whole objects, and embodied heuristics. This is unfortunate, as these strategies help humans avoid critical mistakes and have proven pedagogical value in Bayesian reasoning. In order to overcome these biases and aid understanding and learning, we included prompts that induce LLMs to use these strategies. We found that LLMs with CoT incorporate them but not consistently. They show persistent biases towards symbolic reasoning and avoidance or phobia of ecologically valid strategies.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation of Body Motion Data by Neural Gas Network for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of emotion recognition using body motion, the primary challenge lies in the scarcity of diverse and generalizable datasets. Automatic emotion recognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text, images, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its appearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for emotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often complex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network (NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and generation speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the neurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form the skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body posture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body motion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by GANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more. Furthermore, we continued evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a few others. Joint-related features or kinematic parameters were extracted, and the system assessed model performance against unseen data. Our findings demonstrate that the NGN algorithm produces more realistic and emotionally distinct body motion data and does so with more synthesizing speed than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Acceptance or Rejection of Lots while Minimizing and Controlling Type I and Type II Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double hypothesis test (DHT) is a test that allows controlling Type I (producer) and Type II (consumer) errors. It is possible to say whether the batch has a defect rate, p, between 1.5 and 2%, or between 2 and 5%, or between 5 and 10%, and so on, until finding a required value for this probability. Using the two probabilities side by side, the Type I error for the lower probability distribution and the Type II error for the higher probability distribution, both can be controlled and minimized. It can be applied in the development or manufacturing process of a batch of components, or in the case of purchasing from a supplier, when the percentage of defects (p) is unknown, considering the technology and/or process available to obtain them. The power of the test is amplified by the joint application of the Limit of Successive Failures (LSF) related to the Renewal Theory. To enable the choice of the most appropriate algorithm for each application. Four distributions are proposed for the Bernoulli event sequence, including their computational efforts: Binomial, Binomial approximated by Poisson, and Binomial approximated by Gaussian (with two variants). Fuzzy logic rules are also applied to facilitate decision-making.</description>

      <title>Cafe-Talk: Generating 3D Talking Face Animation with Multimodal Coarse- and Fine-grained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking face method should offer both accurate lip synchronization and controllable expressions. Previous methods solely adopt discrete emotion labels to globally control expressions throughout sequences while limiting flexible fine-grained facial control within the spatiotemporal domain. We propose a diffusion-transformer-based 3D talking face generation model, Cafe-Talk, which simultaneously incorporates coarse- and fine-grained multimodal control conditions. Nevertheless, the entanglement of multiple conditions challenges achieving satisfying performance. To disentangle speech audio and fine-grained conditions, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. Specifically, Cafe-Talk is initially trained using only speech audio and coarse-grained conditions. Then, a proposed fine-grained control adapter gradually adds fine-grained instructions represented by action units (AUs), preventing unfavorable speech-lip synchronization. To disentangle coarse- and fine-grained conditions, we design a swap-label training mechanism, which enables the dominance of the fine-grained conditions. We also devise a mask-based CFG technique to regulate the occurrence and intensity of fine-grained control. In addition, a text-based detector is introduced with text-AU alignment to enable natural language user input and further support multimodal control. Extensive experimental results prove that Cafe-Talk achieves state-of-the-art lip synchronization and expressiveness performance and receives wide acceptance in fine-grained control in user studies.

      <title>Content ARCs: Decentralized Content Rights in the Age of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called \emph{Content ARCs} (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.</description>

      <title>Policy Frameworks for Transparent Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by decomposing complex problems into step-by-step solutions, improving performance on reasoning tasks. However, current CoT disclosure policies vary widely across different models in frontend visibility, API access, and pricing strategies, lacking a unified policy framework. This paper analyzes the dual-edged implications of full CoT disclosure: while it empowers small-model distillation, fosters trust, and enables error diagnosis, it also risks violating intellectual property, enabling misuse, and incurring operational costs. We propose a tiered-access policy framework that balances transparency, accountability, and security by tailoring CoT availability to academic, business, and general users through ethical licensing, structured reasoning outputs, and cross-tier safeguards. By harmonizing accessibility with ethical and operational considerations, this framework aims to advance responsible AI deployment while mitigating risks of misuse or misinterpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that there is a need for Accessibility to be represented in several important domains:
  - Capitalize on the new capabilities AI provides - Support for open source development of AI, which can allow disabled and disability focused professionals to contribute, including
  - Development of Accessibility Apps which help realise the promise of AI in accessibility domains
  - Open Source Model Development and Validation to ensure that accessibility concerns are addressed in these algorithms
  - Data Augmentation to include accessibility in data sets used to train models
  - Accessible Interfaces that allow disabled people to use any AI app, and to validate its outputs
  - Dedicated Functionality and Libraries that can make it easy to integrate AI support into a variety of settings and apps. - Data security and privacy and privacy risks including data collected by AI based accessibility technologies; and the possibility of disability disclosure. - Disability-specific AI risks and biases including both direct bias (during AI use by the disabled person) and indirect bias (when AI is used by someone else on data relating to a disabled person).</description>

      <title>SAUCE: Selective Concept Unlearning in Vision-Language Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning methods for vision-language models (VLMs) have primarily adapted techniques from large language models (LLMs), relying on weight updates that demand extensive annotated forget sets. Moreover, these methods perform unlearning at a coarse granularity, often leading to excessive forgetting and reduced model utility. To address this issue, we introduce SAUCE, a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for fine-grained and selective concept unlearning in VLMs. Briefly, SAUCE first trains SAEs to capture high-dimensional, semantically rich sparse features. It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAUCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 18.04% in unlearning quality while maintaining comparable model utility. Furthermore, we investigate SAUCE's robustness against widely used adversarial attacks, its transferability across models, and its scalability in handling multiple simultaneous unlearning requests. Our findings establish SAUCE as an effective and scalable solution for selective concept unlearning in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Unsupervised Joint Denoising and Enhancement for Real-World low-light Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world low-light images often suffer from complex degradations such as local overexposure, low brightness, noise, and uneven illumination. Supervised methods tend to overfit to specific scenarios, while unsupervised methods, though better at generalization, struggle to model these degradations due to the lack of reference images. To address this issue, we propose an interpretable, zero-reference joint denoising and low-light enhancement framework tailored for real-world scenarios. Our method derives a training strategy based on paired sub-images with varying illumination and noise levels, grounded in physical imaging principles and retinex theory. Additionally, we leverage the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to perform frequency domain decomposition in the sRGB space, and introduce an implicit-guided hybrid representation strategy that effectively separates intricate compounded degradations. In the backbone network design, we develop retinal decomposition network guided by implicit degradation representation mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

      <title>Advancing Chronic Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Vision-Language Models: A Multi modal Framework for Precision Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background This study proposes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging the SIGLIP encoder and Gemma-3b transformer decoder to enhance automated chronic tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images with clinical data, the model addresses the challenges of manual interpretation, improving diagnostic consistency and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
  Methods The VLM architecture combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual encoding and a transformer-based text encoder to process clinical context, such as patient histories and treatment records. Cross-modal attention mechanisms align radiographic features with textual information, while the Gemma-3b decoder generates comprehensive diagnostic reports. The model was pre-trained on 5 million paired medical images and texts and fine-tuned using 100,000 chronic TB-specific chest X-rays.
  Results The model demonstrated high precision (94 percent) and recall (94 percent) for detecting key chronic TB pathologies, including fibrosis, calcified granulomas, and bronchiectasis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores exceeded 0.93, and Intersection over Union (IoU) values were above 0.91, validating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing TB-related abnormalities.
  Conclusion The VLM offers a robust and scalable solution for automated chronic TB diagnosis, integrating radiographic and clinical data to deliver actionable and context-aware insights. Future work will address subtle pathologies and dataset biases to enhance the model's generalizability, ensuring equitable performance across diverse populations and healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Rapid Identification of Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens in Blood Smears of Septic Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacteria species and 3 yeast-like fungi from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of positive blood samples from sepsis patients.
  A total of 16,637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. The analysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Nakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due to high morphotic diversity.
  The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification, but it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the training data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial diagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis treatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results presented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the European Patent Office EP24461637.1 "A computer implemented method for identifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor".</description>

Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the aggravating biodiversity crisis have resulted in a research area where AI-based computational methods are being developed to act as allies in conservation, and the sustainable use and management of natural resources. While important general guidelines have been established globally regarding the opportunities and challenges that this interdisciplinary research offers, it is essential to generate local reflections from the specific contexts and realities of each region. Hence, this document aims to analyze the scope of this research area from a perspective focused on Colombia and the Neotropics. In this paper, we summarize the main experiences and debates that took place at the Humboldt Institute between 2023 and 2024 in Colombia. To illustrate the variety of promising opportunities, we present current uses such as automatic species identification from images and recordings, species modeling, and in silico bioprospecting, among others. From the experiences described above, we highlight limitations, challenges, and opportunities for in order to successfully implementate AI in conservation efforts and sustainable management of biological resources in the Neotropics. The result aims to be a guide for researchers, decision makers, and biodiversity managers, facilitating the understanding of how artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated into conservation and sustainable use strategies. Furthermore, it also seeks to open a space for dialogue on the development of policies that promote the responsible and ethical adoption of AI in local contexts, ensuring that its benefits are harnessed without compromising biodiversity or the cultural and ecosystemic values inherent in Colombia and the Neotropics.</description>

      <title>Sampling Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>Novel AI-Based Quantification of Breast Arterial Calcification to Predict Cardiovascular Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Women are underdiagnosed and undertreated for cardiovascular disease. Automatic quantification of breast arterial calcification on screening mammography can identify women at risk for cardiovascular disease and enable earlier treatment and management of disease. In this retrospective study of 116,135 women from two healthcare systems, a transformer-based neural network quantified BAC severity (no BAC, mild, moderate, and severe) on screening mammograms. Outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. BAC severity was independently associated with MACE after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, with increasing hazard ratios from mild (HR 1.18-1.22), moderate (HR 1.38-1.47), to severe BAC (HR 2.03-2.22) across datasets (all p&lt;0.001). This association remained significant across all age groups, with even mild BAC indicating increased risk in women under 50. BAC remained an independent predictor when analyzed alongside ASCVD risk scores, showing significant associations with myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality (all p&lt;0.005). Automated BAC quantification enables opportunistic cardiovascular risk assessment during routine mammography without additional radiation or cost. This approach provides value beyond traditional risk factors, particularly in younger women, offering potential for early CVD risk stratification in the millions of women undergoing annual mammography.</description>

      <title>Fire and Smoke Datasets in 20 Years: An In-depth Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fire and smoke phenomena pose a significant threat to the natural environment, ecosystems, and global economy, as well as human lives and wildlife. In this particular circumstance, there is a demand for more sophisticated and advanced technologies to implement an effective strategy for early detection, real-time monitoring, and minimizing the overall impacts of fires on ecological balance and public safety. Recently, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) frameworks has substantially revolutionized the momentum for developing efficient fire management systems. However, these systems extensively rely on the availability of adequate and high-quality fire and smoke data to create proficient Machine Learning (ML) methods for various tasks, such as detection and monitoring. Although fire and smoke datasets play a critical role in training, evaluating, and testing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models, a comprehensive review of the existing datasets is still unexplored. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth review to systematically analyze and evaluate fire and smoke datasets collected over the past 20 years. We investigate the characteristics of each dataset, including type, size, format, collection methods, and geographical diversities. We also review and highlight the unique features of each dataset, such as imaging modalities (RGB, thermal, infrared) and their applicability for different fire management tasks (classification, segmentation, detection). Furthermore, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and discuss their potential for advancing research and technology in fire management. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experimental analyses across different datasets using several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as ResNet-50, DeepLab-V3, and YoloV8.</description>

      <title>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning in a Real World Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, reinforcement learning (RL) with physical robots has attracted the attention of a wide range of researchers. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms do not consider that physical environments do not wait for the RL agent to make decisions or updates. RL agents learn by periodically conducting computationally expensive gradient updates. When decision-making and gradient update tasks are carried out sequentially by the RL agent in a physical robot, it significantly increases the agent's response time. In a rapidly changing environment, this increased response time may be detrimental to the performance of the learning agent. Asynchronous RL methods, which separate the computation of decision-making and gradient updates, are a potential solution to this problem. However, only a few comparisons between asynchronous and synchronous RL have been made with physical robots. For this reason, the exact performance benefits of using asynchronous RL methods over synchronous RL methods are still unclear. In this study, we provide a performance comparison between asynchronous and synchronous RL using a physical robotic arm called Franka Emika Panda. Our experiments show that the agents learn faster and attain significantly more returns using asynchronous RL. Our experiments also demonstrate that the learning agent with a faster response time performs better than the agent with a slower response time, even if the agent with a slower response time performs a higher number of gradient updates.</description>

      <title>A Generalist Hanabi Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems can develop cooperative strategies through repeated interactions. However, these systems are unable to perform well on any other setting than the one they have been trained on, and struggle to successfully cooperate with unfamiliar collaborators. This is particularly visible in the Hanabi benchmark, a popular 2-to-5 player cooperative card-game which requires complex reasoning and precise assistance to other agents. Current MARL agents for Hanabi can only learn one specific game-setting (e.g., 2-player games), and play with the same algorithmic agents. This is in stark contrast to humans, who can quickly adjust their strategies to work with unfamiliar partners or situations. In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Replay Relevance Distributed DQN (R3D2), a generalist agent for Hanabi, designed to overcome these limitations. We reformulate the task using text, as language has been shown to improve transfer. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm that copes with the resulting dynamic observation- and action-space. In doing so, our agent is the first that can play all game settings concurrently, and extend strategies learned from one setting to other ones. As a consequence, our agent also demonstrates the ability to collaborate with different algorithmic agents -- agents that are themselves unable to do so. The implementation code is available at: $\href{https://github.com/chandar-lab/R3D2-A-Generalist-Hanabi-Agent}{R3D2-A-Generalist-Hanabi-Agent}$</description>

      <title>Designing and Deploying AI Models for Sustainable Logistics Optimization: A Case Study on Eco-Efficient Supply Chains in the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has significantly transformed logistics and supply chain management, particularly in the pursuit of sustainability and eco-efficiency. This study explores AI-based methodologies for optimizing logistics operations in the USA, focusing on reducing environmental impact, improving fuel efficiency, and minimizing costs. Key AI applications include predictive analytics for demand forecasting, route optimization through machine learning, and AI-powered fuel efficiency strategies. Various models, such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks, are applied to real-world logistics datasets to reduce carbon emissions based on logistics operations, optimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time, and predict future deliveries to plan optimal routes. Other models such as K-Means and DBSCAN are also used to optimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time for logistics operations. This study utilizes datasets from logistics companies' databases. The study also assesses model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R2 score. This study also explores how these models can be deployed to various platforms for real-time logistics and supply chain use. The models are also examined through a thorough case study, highlighting best practices and regulatory frameworks that promote sustainability. The findings demonstrate AI's potential to enhance logistics efficiency, reduce carbon footprints, and contribute to a more resilient and adaptive supply chain ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Squeeze Out Tokens from Sample for Finer-Grained Data Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely observed data scaling laws, in which error falls off as a power of the training size, demonstrate the diminishing returns of unselective data expansion. Hence, data governance is proposed to downsize datasets through pruning non-informative samples. Yet, isolating the impact of a specific sample on overall model performance is challenging, due to the vast computation required for tryout all sample combinations. Current data governors circumvent this complexity by estimating sample contributions through heuristic-derived scalar scores, thereby discarding low-value ones. Despite thorough sample sieving, retained samples contain substantial undesired tokens intrinsically, underscoring the potential for further compression and purification. In this work, we upgrade data governance from a 'sieving' approach to a 'juicing' one. Instead of scanning for least-flawed samples, our dual-branch DataJuicer applies finer-grained intra-sample governance. It squeezes out informative tokens and boosts image-text alignments. Specifically, the vision branch retains salient image patches and extracts relevant object classes, while the text branch incorporates these classes to enhance captions. Consequently, DataJuicer yields more refined datasets through finer-grained governance. Extensive experiments across datasets demonstrate that DataJuicer significantly outperforms existing DataSieve in image-text retrieval, classification, and dense visual reasoning.</description>

Abstract: Subject of research: is the study of methods for analyzing perimetric images for the diagnosis and control of glaucoma diseases. Objects of research: is a dataset collected on the ophthalmological perimeter with the results of various patient pathologies, since the ophthalmological community is acutely aware of the issue of disease control and import substitution. [5]. Purpose of research: is to consider various machine learning methods that can classify glaucoma. This is possible thanks to the classifier built after labeling the dataset. It is able to determine from the image whether the visual fields depicted on it are the results of the impact of glaucoma on the eyes or other visual diseases. Earlier in the work [3], a dataset was described that was collected on the Tomey perimeter. The average age of the examined patients ranged from 30 to 85 years. Methods of research: machine learning methods for classifying image results (stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes). Main results of research: the result of the study is computer modeling that can determine from the image whether the result is glaucoma or another disease (binary classification).</description>

      <title>Workflow for Safe-AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development and deployment of safe and dependable AI models is crucial in applications where functional safety is a key concern. Given the rapid advancement in AI research and the relative novelty of the safe-AI domain, there is an increasing need for a workflow that balances stability with adaptability. This work proposes a transparent, complete, yet flexible and lightweight workflow that highlights both reliability and qualifiability. The core idea is that the workflow must be qualifiable, which demands the use of qualified tools. Tool qualification is a resource-intensive process, both in terms of time and cost. We therefore place value on a lightweight workflow featuring a minimal number of tools with limited features. The workflow is built upon an extended ONNX model description allowing for validation of AI algorithms from their generation to runtime deployment. This validation is essential to ensure that models are validated before being reliably deployed across different runtimes, particularly in mixed-criticality systems. Keywords-AI workflows, safe-AI, dependable-AI, functional safety, v-model development</description>

      <title>Effortless Active Labeling for Long-Term Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term test-time adaptation (TTA) is a challenging task due to error accumulation. Recent approaches tackle this issue by actively labeling a small proportion of samples in each batch, yet the annotation burden quickly grows as the batch number increases. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve effortless active labeling so that a maximum of one sample is selected for annotation in each batch. First, we annotate the most valuable sample in each batch based on the single-step optimization perspective in the TTA context. In this scenario, the samples that border between the source- and target-domain data distributions are considered the most feasible for the model to learn in one iteration. Then, we introduce an efficient strategy to identify these samples using feature perturbation. Second, we discover that the gradient magnitudes produced by the annotated and unannotated samples have significant variations. Therefore, we propose balancing their impact on model optimization using two dynamic weights. Extensive experiments on the popular ImageNet-C, -R, -K, -A and PACS databases demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly lower annotation costs.</description>

      <title>SpecReX: Explainable AI for Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is becoming more common for medical diagnostics with deep learning models being increasingly used to leverage its full potential. However, the opaque nature of such models and the sensitivity of medical diagnosis together with regulatory requirements necessitate the need for explainable AI tools. We introduce SpecReX, specifically adapted to explaining Raman spectra. SpecReX uses the theory of actual causality to rank causal responsibility in a spectrum, quantified by iteratively refining mutated versions of the spectrum and testing if it retains the original classification. The explanations provided by SpecReX take the form of a responsibility map, highlighting spectral regions most responsible for the model to make a correct classification. To assess the validity of SpecReX, we create increasingly complex simulated spectra, in which a "ground truth" signal is seeded, to train a classifier. We then obtain SpecReX explanations and compare the results with another explainability tool. By using simulated spectra we establish that SpecReX localizes to the known differences between classes, under a number of conditions. This provides a foundation on which we can find the spectral features which differentiate disease classes. This is an important first step in proving the validity of SpecReX.</description>

      <title>Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Perform Rapid, Resolution-Invariant Grain Growth Modeling via Fourier Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input-output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.</description>

      <title>Potential Score Matching: Debiasing Molecular Structure Sampling with Potential Energy Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ensemble average of physical properties of molecules is closely related to the distribution of molecular conformations, and sampling such distributions is a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Traditional methods like molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are commonly used but can be time-consuming and costly. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as efficient alternatives by learning the distribution of training data. Obtaining an unbiased target distribution is still an expensive task, primarily because it requires satisfying ergodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose Potential Score Matching (PSM), an approach that utilizes the potential energy gradient to guide generative models. PSM does not require exact energy functions and can debias sample distributions even when trained on limited and biased data. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, a commonly used toy model. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation of PSM to high-dimensional problems using the MD17 and MD22 datasets. The results demonstrate that molecular distributions generated by PSM more closely approximate the Boltzmann distribution compared to traditional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Robust Weight Imprinting: Insights from Neural Collapse and Proxy-Based Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacity of a foundation model allows for adaptation to new downstream tasks. Weight imprinting is a universal and efficient method to fulfill this purpose. It has been reinvented several times, but it has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation. This allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of imprinting and a comparison of the existing work. We reveal the benefits of representing novel data with multiple proxies in the generation step and show the importance of proper normalization. We determine those proxies through clustering and propose a novel variant of imprinting that outperforms previous work. We motivate this by the neural collapse phenomenon -- an important connection that we can draw for the first time. Our results show an increase of up to 4% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes.</description>

      <title>SocialJax: An Evaluation Suite for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social dilemmas pose a significant challenge in the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Melting Pot is an extensive framework designed to evaluate social dilemma environments, providing an evaluation protocol that measures generalization to new social partners across various test scenarios. However, running reinforcement learning algorithms in the official Melting Pot environments demands substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce SocialJax, a suite of sequential social dilemma environments implemented in JAX. JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library for Python that enables significant improvements in the operational efficiency of SocialJax on GPUs and TPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that the training pipeline of SocialJax achieves a 50\texttimes{} speedup in real-time performance compared to Melting Pot's RLlib baselines. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of baseline algorithms within the SocialJax environments. Finally, we use Schelling diagrams to verify the social dilemma properties of these environments, ensuring they accurately capture the dynamics of social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>PHGNN: A Novel Prompted Hypergraph Neural Network to Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prognosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion are crucial for early intervention. However, existing multimodal methods face several challenges, from the heterogeneity of input data, to underexplored modality interactions, missing data due to patient dropouts, and limited data caused by the time-consuming and costly data collection process. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompted Hypergraph Neural Network (PHGNN) framework that addresses these limitations by integrating hypergraph based learning with prompt learning. Hypergraphs capture higher-order relationships between different modalities, while our prompt learning approach for hypergraphs, adapted from NLP, enables efficient training with limited data. Our model is validated through extensive experiments on the ADNI dataset, outperforming SOTA methods in both AD diagnosis and the prediction of MCI conversion.</description>

Abstract: The evaluation of machine-generated image captions is a complex and evolving challenge. With the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), image captioning has become a core task, increasing the need for robust and reliable evaluation metrics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in image captioning evaluation, analyzing the evolution, strengths, and limitations of existing metrics. We assess these metrics across multiple dimensions, including correlation with human judgment, ranking accuracy, and sensitivity to hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the challenges posed by the longer and more detailed captions generated by MLLMs and examine the adaptability of current metrics to these stylistic variations. Our analysis highlights some limitations of standard evaluation approaches and suggests promising directions for future research in image captioning assessment.</description>

Abstract: False arrhythmia alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) are a significant challenge, contributing to alarm fatigue and potentially compromising patient safety. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) alarms are particularly difficult to detect accurately due to their complex nature. This paper presents a machine learning approach to reduce false VT alarms using the VTaC dataset, a benchmark dataset of annotated VT alarms from ICU monitors. We extract time-domain and frequency-domain features from waveform data, preprocess the data, and train deep learning models to classify true and false VT alarms. Our results demonstrate high performance, with ROC-AUC scores exceeding 0.96 across various training configurations. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to improve the accuracy of VT alarm detection in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Assessing Large Language Models for Automated Feedback Generation in Learning Programming Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing effective feedback is important for student learning in programming problem-solving. In this sense, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools to automate feedback generation. However, their reliability and ability to identify reasoning errors in student code remain not well understood. This study evaluates the performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4-Turbo, and Gemini-1.5-pro) on a benchmark dataset of 45 student solutions. We assessed the models' capacity to provide accurate and insightful feedback, particularly in identifying reasoning mistakes. Our analysis reveals that 63\% of feedback hints were accurate and complete, while 37\% contained mistakes, including incorrect line identification, flawed explanations, or hallucinated issues. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs in programming education and underscore the need for improvements to enhance reliability and minimize risks in educational applications.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based motion imitation for physiologically plausible musculoskeletal motor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do humans move? The quest to understand human motion has broad applications in numerous fields, ranging from computer animation and motion synthesis to neuroscience, human prosthetics and rehabilitation. Although advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced impressive results in capturing human motion using simplified humanoids, controlling physiologically accurate models of the body remains an open challenge. In this work, we present a model-free motion imitation framework (KINESIS) to advance the understanding of muscle-based motor control. Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower body with 80 muscle actuators and 20 DoF, we demonstrate that KINESIS achieves strong imitation performance on 1.9 hours of motion capture data, is controllable by natural language through pre-trained text-to-motion generative models, and can be fine-tuned to carry out high-level tasks such as target goal reaching. Importantly, KINESIS generates muscle activity patterns that correlate well with human EMG activity. The physiological plausibility makes KINESIS a promising model for tackling challenging problems in human motor control theory, which we highlight by investigating Bernstein's redundancy problem in the context of locomotion. Code, videos and benchmarks will be available at https://github.com/amathislab/Kinesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Accumulated Attention Map for Interpreting Evolution of Decision-Making in Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various Vision Transformer (ViT) models have been widely used for image recognition tasks. However, existing visual explanation methods can not display the attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which explains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its decision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic Accumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can visualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom through ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to construct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class] token generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can also obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the classification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of classification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise importance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial features are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance coefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention flow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The contribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the decision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by proposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights. The quantitative and qualitative analysis consistently validate the effectiveness and superior capacity of the proposed DAAM for not only interpreting ViT models with the fully-connected layers as the classifier but also self-supervised ViT models. The code is available at https://github.com/ly9802/DynamicAccumulatedAttentionMap.</description>

      <title>RAGO: Systematic Performance Optimization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which combines large language models (LLMs) with retrievals from external knowledge databases, is emerging as a popular approach for reliable LLM serving. However, efficient RAG serving remains an open challenge due to the rapid emergence of many RAG variants and the substantial differences in workload characteristics across them. In this paper, we make three fundamental contributions to advancing RAG serving. First, we introduce RAGSchema, a structured abstraction that captures the wide range of RAG algorithms, serving as a foundation for performance optimization. Second, we analyze several representative RAG workloads with distinct RAGSchema, revealing significant performance variability across these workloads. Third, to address this variability and meet diverse performance requirements, we propose RAGO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Optimizer), a system optimization framework for efficient RAG serving. Our evaluation shows that RAGO achieves up to a 2x increase in QPS per chip and a 55% reduction in time-to-first-token latency compared to RAG systems built on LLM-system extensions.</description>

      <title>Core-Periphery Principle Guided State Space Model for Functional Connectome Classification</title>

Abstract: Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quizzes play a crucial role in education by reinforcing students' understanding of key concepts and encouraging self-directed exploration. However, compiling high-quality quizzes can be challenging and require deep expertise and insight into specific subject matter. Although LLMs have greatly enhanced the efficiency of quiz generation, concerns remain regarding the quality of these AI-generated quizzes and their educational impact on students. To address these issues, we introduce ConQuer, a concept-based quiz generation framework that leverages external knowledge sources. We employ comprehensive evaluation dimensions to assess the quality of the generated quizzes, using LLMs as judges. Our experiment results demonstrate a 4.8% improvement in evaluation scores and a 77.52% win rate in pairwise comparisons against baseline quiz sets. Ablation studies further underscore the effectiveness of each component in our framework. Code available at https://github.com/sofyc/ConQuer.</description>

      <title>DPImageBench: A Unified Benchmark for Differentially Private Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) image synthesis aims to generate artificial images that retain the properties of sensitive images while protecting the privacy of individual images within the dataset. Despite recent advancements, we find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been applied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current methods but also hinders future advancements.
  To address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image synthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We study eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on model architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2) Evaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to thoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting downstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set not only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench corrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation protocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates current and future implementations within a unified framework. With DPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the common wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial, we find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive images significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does not always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional features, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less affected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional features, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the latter under a low privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Construction Site Scaffolding Completeness Detection Based on Mask R-CNN and Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction site scaffolding is essential for many building projects, and ensuring its safety is crucial to prevent accidents. The safety inspector must check the scaffolding's completeness and integrity, where most violations occur. The inspection process includes ensuring all the components are in the right place since workers often compromise safety for convenience and disassemble parts such as cross braces. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach to detect the scaffolding and its cross braces using computer vision. A scaffold image dataset with annotated labels is used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. With the proposed approach, we can automatically detect the completeness of cross braces from images taken at construction sites, without the need for manual inspection, saving a significant amount of time and labor costs. This non-invasive and efficient solution for detecting scaffolding completeness can help improve safety in construction sites.</description>

      <title>GR00T N1: An Open Foundation Model for Generalist Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose robots need a versatile body and an intelligent mind. Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</description>

      <title>LipShiFT: A Certifiably Robust Shift-based Vision Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving tight Lipschitz bounds for transformer-based architectures presents a significant challenge. The large input sizes and high-dimensional attention modules typically prove to be crucial bottlenecks during the training process and leads to sub-optimal results. Our research highlights practical constraints of these methods in vision tasks. We find that Lipschitz-based margin training acts as a strong regularizer while restricting weights in successive layers of the model. Focusing on a Lipschitz continuous variant of the ShiftViT model, we address significant training challenges for transformer-based architectures under norm-constrained input setting. We provide an upper bound estimate for the Lipschitz constants of this model using the $l_2$ norm on common image classification datasets. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our method scales to larger models and advances the state-of-the-art in certified robustness for transformer-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Modeling of Zero-Shot Classifications for Urban Flood Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer a promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street flooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.</description>

Abstract: Word embeddings have been a key building block for NLP in which models relied heavily on word embeddings in many different tasks. In this paper, a model is proposed based on using Bidirectional LSTM/CRF with word embeddings to perform named entity recognition for any language. This is done by training a model on a source language (English) and transforming word embeddings from the target language into word embeddings of the source language by using an orthogonal linear transformation matrix. Evaluation of the model shows that by training a model on an English dataset the model was capable of detecting named entities in an Arabic dataset without neither training or fine tuning the model on an Arabic language dataset.</description>

      <title>Involution and BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced SISR. However, increasing network depth increases parameters, and memory usage, and slows training, which is problematic for resource-limited devices. To address this, lightweight models are developed to balance accuracy and efficiency. We propose the Involution &amp; BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Network (IBMDN), combining Involution &amp; BSConv Multi-Depth Distillation Block (IBMDB) and the Contrast and High-Frequency Attention Block (CHFAB). IBMDB integrates Involution and BSConv to balance computational efficiency and feature extraction. CHFAB enhances high-frequency details for better visual quality. IBMDB is compatible with other SISR architectures and reduces complexity, improving evaluation metrics like PSNR and SSIM. In transformer-based models, IBMDB reduces memory usage while improving feature extraction. In GANs, it enhances perceptual quality, balancing pixel-level accuracy with perceptual details. Our experiments show that the method achieves high accuracy with minimal computational cost. The code is available at GitHub.</description>

Abstract: As deep neural networks(DNN) become increasingly prevalent, particularly in high-stakes areas such as autonomous driving and healthcare, the ability to detect incorrect predictions of models and intervene accordingly becomes crucial for safety. In this work, we investigate the detection of misclassified inputs for image classification models from the lens of adversarial perturbation: we propose to use robust radius (a.k.a. input-space margin) as a confidence metric and design two efficient estimation algorithms, RR-BS and RR-Fast, for misclassification detection. Furthermore, we design a training method called Radius Aware Training (RAT) to boost models' ability to identify mistakes. Extensive experiments show our method could achieve up to 29.3% reduction on AURC and 21.62% reduction in FPR@95TPR, compared with previous methods.</description>

      <title>Learning with Expert Abstractions for Efficient Multi-Task Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making in complex, continuous multi-task environments is often hindered by the difficulty of obtaining accurate models for planning and the inefficiency of learning purely from trial and error. While precise environment dynamics may be hard to specify, human experts can often provide high-fidelity abstractions that capture the essential high-level structure of a task and user preferences in the target environment. Existing hierarchical approaches often target discrete settings and do not generalize across tasks. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that addresses these limitations by dynamically planning over the expert-specified abstraction to generate subgoals to learn a goal-conditioned policy. To overcome the challenges of learning under sparse rewards, we shape the reward based on the optimal state value in the abstract model. This structured decision-making process enhances sample efficiency and facilitates zero-shot generalization. Our empirical evaluation on a suite of procedurally generated continuous control environments demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods in terms of sample efficiency, task completion rate, scalability to complex tasks, and generalization to novel scenarios.</description>

      <title>MMDT: Decoding the Trustworthiness and Safety of Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) play a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous driving, healthcare, and virtual assistants. However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives. This work introduces the first comprehensive and unique safety and trustworthiness evaluation platform for MMFMs, paving the way for developing safer and more reliable MMFMs and systems. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://mmdecodingtrust.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: The CheckThat! lab aims to advance the development of innovative technologies designed to identify and counteract online disinformation and manipulation efforts across various languages and platforms. The first five editions focused on key tasks in the information verification pipeline, including check-worthiness, evidence retrieval and pairing, and verification. Since the 2023 edition, the lab has expanded its scope to address auxiliary tasks that support research and decision-making in verification. In the 2025 edition, the lab revisits core verification tasks while also considering auxiliary challenges. Task 1 focuses on the identification of subjectivity (a follow-up from CheckThat! 2024), Task 2 addresses claim normalization, Task 3 targets fact-checking numerical claims, and Task 4 explores scientific web discourse processing. These tasks present challenging classification and retrieval problems at both the document and span levels, including multilingual settings.</description>

      <title>Curiosity-Diffuser: Curiosity Guide Diffusion Models for Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the bottlenecks in robotic intelligence is the instability of neural network models, which, unlike control models, lack a well-defined convergence domain and stability. This leads to risks when applying intelligence in the physical world. Specifically, imitation policy based on neural network may generate hallucinations, leading to inaccurate behaviors that impact the safety of real-world applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Curiosity-Diffuser, aimed at guiding the conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories with lower curiosity, thereby improving the reliability of policy. The core idea is to use a Random Network Distillation (RND) curiosity module to assess whether the model's behavior aligns with the training data, and then minimize curiosity by classifier guidance diffusion to reduce overgeneralization during inference. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient metric for evaluating the reliability of the policy, measuring the similarity between the generated behaviors and the training dataset, to facilitate research about reliability learning. Finally, simulation verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method to a variety of scenarios, showing that Curiosity-Diffuser significantly improves task performance and produces behaviors that are more similar to the training data.

      <title>Project Jenkins: Turning Monkey Neural Data into Robotic Arm Movement, and Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project Jenkins explores how neural activity in the brain can be decoded into robotic movement and, conversely, how movement patterns can be used to generate synthetic neural data. Using real neural data recorded from motor and premotor cortex areas of a macaque monkey named Jenkins, we develop models for decoding (converting brain signals into robotic arm movements) and encoding (simulating brain activity corresponding to a given movement). For the interface between the brain simulation and the physical world, we utilized Koch v1.1 leader and follower robotic arms. We developed an interactive web console that allows users to generate synthetic brain data from joystick movements in real time. Our results are a step towards brain-controlled robotics, prosthetics, and enhancing normal motor function. By accurately modeling brain activity, we take a step toward flexible brain-computer interfaces that generalize beyond predefined movements. To support the research community, we provide open source tools for both synthetic data generation and neural decoding, fostering reproducibility and accelerating progress.

      <title>1000 Layer Networks for Self-Supervised RL: Scaling Depth Can Enable New Goal-Reaching Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling up self-supervised learning has driven breakthroughs in language and vision, yet comparable progress has remained elusive in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance by $2\times$ - $50\times$. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.</description>

      <title>Efficient Personalization of Quantized Diffusion Model without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis, but they demand extensive computational and memory resources for training, fine-tuning and inference. Although advanced quantization techniques have successfully minimized memory usage for inference, training and fine-tuning these quantized models still require large memory possibly due to dequantization for accurate computation of gradients and/or backpropagation for gradient-based algorithms. However, memory-efficient fine-tuning is particularly desirable for applications such as personalization that often must be run on edge devices like mobile phones with private data. In this work, we address this challenge by quantizing a diffusion model with personalization via Textual Inversion and by leveraging a zeroth-order optimization on personalization tokens without dequantization so that it does not require gradient and activation storage for backpropagation that consumes considerable memory. Since a gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization is quite noisy for a single or a few images in personalization, we propose to denoise the estimated gradient by projecting it onto a subspace that is constructed with the past history of the tokens, dubbed Subspace Gradient. In addition, we investigated the influence of text embedding in image generation, leading to our proposed time steps sampling, dubbed Partial Uniform Timestep Sampling for sampling with effective diffusion timesteps. Our method achieves comparable performance to prior methods in image and text alignment scores for personalizing Stable Diffusion with only forward passes while reducing training memory demand up to $8.2\times$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Limits of KV Cache Compression in Visual Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Visual Autoregressive models is the substantial memory overhead required during inference to store previously generated representations. Despite various attempts to mitigate this issue through compression techniques, prior works have not explicitly formalized the problem of KV-cache compression in this context. In this work, we take the first step in formally defining the KV-cache compression problem for Visual Autoregressive transformers. We then establish a fundamental negative result, proving that any mechanism for sequential visual token generation under attention-based architectures must use at least $\Omega(n^2 d)$ memory, when $d = \Omega(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated and $d$ is the embedding dimensionality. This result demonstrates that achieving truly sub-quadratic memory usage is impossible without additional structural constraints. Our proof is constructed via a reduction from a computational lower bound problem, leveraging randomized embedding techniques inspired by dimensionality reduction principles. Finally, we discuss how sparsity priors on visual representations can influence memory efficiency, presenting both impossibility results and potential directions for mitigating memory overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), reasoning models, and agentic AI approaches coincides with a growing global mental health crisis, where increasing demand has not translated into adequate access to professional support, particularly for underserved populations. This presents a unique opportunity for AI to complement human-led interventions, offering scalable and context-aware support while preserving human connection in this sensitive domain. We explore various AI applications in peer support, self-help interventions, proactive monitoring, and data-driven insights, using a human-centred approach that ensures AI supports rather than replaces human interaction. However, AI deployment in mental health fields presents challenges such as ethical concerns, transparency, privacy risks, and risks of over-reliance. We propose a hybrid ecosystem where where AI assists but does not replace human providers, emphasising responsible deployment and evaluation. We also present some of our early work and findings in several of these AI applications. Finally, we outline future research directions for refining AI-enhanced interventions while adhering to ethical and culturally sensitive guidelines.</description>

      <title>MetaLadder: Ascending Mathematical Solution Quality via Analogical-Problem Reasoning Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in solving mathematical reasoning tasks, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data as a vital component in guiding answer generation. Current paradigms typically generate CoT and answers directly for a given problem, diverging from human problem-solving strategies to some extent. Humans often solve problems by recalling analogous cases and leveraging their solutions to reason about the current task. Inspired by this cognitive process, we propose \textbf{MetaLadder}, a novel framework that explicitly prompts LLMs to recall and reflect on meta-problems, those structurally or semantically analogous problems, alongside their CoT solutions before addressing the target problem. Additionally, we introduce a problem-restating mechanism to enhance the model's comprehension of the target problem by regenerating the original question, which further improves reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the model can achieve reasoning transfer from analogical problems, mimicking human-like "learning from examples" and generalization abilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our MetaLadder significantly boosts LLMs' problem-solving accuracy, largely outperforming standard CoT-based methods (\textbf{10.3\%} accuracy gain) and other methods. Our code and data has been released at https://github.com/LHL3341/MetaLadder.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Object Hallucinations in MLLMs via Multi-Frequency Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual-language tasks. However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</description>

      <title>Deep Contrastive Unlearning for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past a few years have witnessed the great success of large language models, demonstrating powerful capabilities in comprehending textual data and generating human-like languages. Large language models achieve success by being trained on vast amounts of textual data, including online sources with copyrighted content and user-generated knowledge. However, this comes at a cost: the potential risk of exposing users' privacy and violating copyright protections. Thus, to safeguard individuals' "right to be forgotten", there has been increasing interests in machine unlearning -- the process of removing information carried by particular training samples from a model while not deteriorating its predictive quality. This is a challenging task due to the black-box nature of language models. Most existing studies focus on mitigating the impact of those forgot samples upon a model's outputs, and do not explicitly consider the geometric distributions of samples in the latent space of a model. To address this issue, we propose a machine unlearning framework, named Deep Contrastive Unlearning for fine-Tuning (DeepCUT) language models. Our proposed model achieves machine unlearning by directly optimizing the latent space of a model. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepCUT with consistent and significant improvement over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>POSTA: A Go-to Framework for Customized Artistic Poster Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poster design is a critical medium for visual communication. Prior work has explored automatic poster design using deep learning techniques, but these approaches lack text accuracy, user customization, and aesthetic appeal, limiting their applicability in artistic domains such as movies and exhibitions, where both clear content delivery and visual impact are essential. To address these limitations, we present POSTA: a modular framework powered by diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for customized artistic poster generation. The framework consists of three modules. Background Diffusion creates a themed background based on user input. Design MLLM then generates layout and typography elements that align with and complement the background style. Finally, to enhance the poster's aesthetic appeal, ArtText Diffusion applies additional stylization to key text elements. The final result is a visually cohesive and appealing poster, with a fully modular process that allows for complete customization. To train our models, we develop the PosterArt dataset, comprising high-quality artistic posters annotated with layout, typography, and pixel-level stylized text segmentation. Our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates POSTA's exceptional controllability and design diversity, outperforming existing models in both text accuracy and aesthetic quality.</description>

      <title>MASS: Mathematical Data Selection via Skill Graphs for Pretraining Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality data plays a critical role in the pretraining and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), even determining their performance ceiling to some degree. Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%. These results underscore the potential of MASS to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of pretraining LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Semantic and Clean-label Backdoor Attack against Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown excellent performance in graph-structured tasks such as node classification and graph classification. However, recent research has shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a new type of threat called the backdoor attack, where the adversary can inject a hidden backdoor into the GCNs so that the backdoored model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed to the attacker-specified target label if the hidden backdoor is activated by the attacker-defined trigger. Clean-label backdoor attack and semantic backdoor attack are two new backdoor attacks to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they are more imperceptible and have posed new and serious threats. The semantic and clean-label backdoor attack is not fully explored in GCNs. In this paper, we propose a semantic and clean-label backdoor attack against GCNs under the context of graph classification to reveal the existence of this security vulnerability in GCNs. Specifically, SCLBA conducts an importance analysis on graph samples to select one type of node as semantic trigger, which is then inserted into the graph samples to create poisoning samples without changing the labels of the poisoning samples to the attacker-specified target label. We evaluate SCLBA on multiple datasets and the results show that SCLBA can achieve attack success rates close to 99% with poisoning rates of less than 3%, and with almost no impact on the performance of model on benign samples.</description>

      <title>Shushing! Let's Imagine an Authentic Speech from the Silent Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-guided speech generation aims to produce authentic speech from facial appearance or lip motions without relying on auditory signals, offering significant potential for applications such as dubbing in filmmaking and assisting individuals with aphonia. Despite recent progress, existing methods struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency. To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input, operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens, which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImaginTalk can generate high-fidelity speech with more accurate semantic details and greater expressiveness in timbre and emotion compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Demos are shown at our project page: https://imagintalk.github.io.</description>

      <title>FAVOR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Motion Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video content understanding but still struggle with fine-grained motion comprehension. To comprehensively assess the motion understanding ability of existing MLLMs, we introduce FAVOR-Bench, comprising 1,776 videos with structured manual annotations of various motions. Our benchmark includes both close-ended and open-ended tasks. For close-ended evaluation, we carefully design 8,184 multiple-choice question-answer pairs spanning six distinct sub-tasks. For open-ended evaluation, we develop both a novel cost-efficient LLM-free and a GPT-assisted caption assessment method, where the former can enhance benchmarking interpretability and reproducibility. Comprehensive experiments with 21 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations in their ability to comprehend and describe detailed temporal dynamics in video motions. To alleviate this limitation, we further build FAVOR-Train, a dataset consisting of 17,152 videos with fine-grained motion annotations. The results of finetuning Qwen2.5-VL on FAVOR-Train yield consistent improvements on motion-related tasks of TVBench, MotionBench and our FAVOR-Bench.

      <title>USAM-Net: A U-Net-based Network for Improved Stereo Correspondence and Scene Depth Estimation using Features from a Pre-trained Image Segmentation network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for high-accuracy depth estimation in autonomous driving and augmented reality applications necessitates advanced neural architectures capable of effectively leveraging multiple data modalities. In this context, we introduce the Unified Segmentation Attention Mechanism Network (USAM-Net), a novel convolutional neural network that integrates stereo image inputs with semantic segmentation maps and attention to enhance depth estimation performance. USAM-Net employs a dual-pathway architecture, which combines a pre-trained segmentation model (SAM) and a depth estimation model. The segmentation pathway preprocesses the stereo images to generate semantic masks, which are then concatenated with the stereo images as inputs to the depth estimation pathway. This integration allows the model to focus on important features such as object boundaries and surface textures which are crucial for accurate depth perception. Empirical evaluation on the DrivingStereo dataset demonstrates that USAM-Net achieves superior performance metrics, including a Global Difference (GD) of 3.61\% and an End-Point Error (EPE) of 0.88, outperforming traditional models such as CFNet, SegStereo, and iResNet. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating segmentation information into stereo depth estimation tasks, highlighting the potential of USAM-Net in applications demanding high-precision depth data.</description>

      <title>Application of linear regression method to the deep reinforcement learning in continuous action cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear regression (LR) method offers the advantage that optimal parameters can be calculated relatively easily, although its representation capability is limited than that of the deep learning technique. To improve deep reinforcement learning, the Least Squares Deep Q Network (LS-DQN) method was proposed by Levine et al., which combines Deep Q Network (DQN) with LR method. However, the LS-DQN method assumes that the actions are discrete. In this study, we propose the Double Least Squares Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DLS-DDPG) method to address this limitation. This method combines the LR method with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique, one of the representative deep reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action cases. Numerical experiments conducted in MuJoCo environments showed that the LR update improved performance at least in some tasks, although there are difficulties such as the inability to make the regularization terms small.</description>

      <title>A Novel Channel Boosted Residual CNN-Transformer with Regional-Boundary Learning for Breast Cancer Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in detecting tumors using deep learning on breast ultrasound images (BUSI) have demonstrated significant success. Deep CNNs and vision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial performance. However, challenges related to model complexity and contrast, texture, and tumor morphology variations introduce uncertainties that hinder the effectiveness of current methods. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT components for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem convolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new Regional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast and morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global contextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational efficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse residual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture information and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted (CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by combining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual CNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial attention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving the discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed CB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of 96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI dataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods. These results demonstrate the versatility of our integrated CNN-Transformer framework in capturing diverse features and delivering superior performance in BUSI cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>HAD-Gen: Human-like and Diverse Driving Behavior Modeling for Controllable Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based testing has emerged as an essential tool for verifying and validating autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, contemporary methodologies, such as deterministic and imitation learning-based driver models, struggle to capture the variability of human-like driving behavior. Given these challenges, we propose HAD-Gen, a general framework for realistic traffic scenario generation that simulates diverse human-like driving behaviors. The framework first clusters the vehicle trajectory data into different driving styles according to safety features. It then employs maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning on each of the clusters to learn the reward function corresponding to each driving style. Using these reward functions, the method integrates offline reinforcement learning pre-training and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to obtain general and robust driving policies. Multi-perspective simulation results show that our proposed scenario generation framework can simulate diverse, human-like driving behaviors with strong generalization capability. The proposed framework achieves a 90.96% goal-reaching rate, an off-road rate of 2.08%, and a collision rate of 6.91% in the generalization test, outperforming prior approaches by over 20% in goal-reaching performance.

      <title>Texture-Aware StarGAN for CT data harmonisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis; however, variability across reconstruction kernels hinders data-driven approaches, such as deep learning models, from achieving reliable and generalized performance. To this end, CT data harmonization has emerged as a promising solution to minimize such non-biological variances by standardizing data across different sources or conditions. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved to be a powerful framework for harmonization, framing it as a style-transfer problem. However, GAN-based approaches still face limitations in capturing complex relationships within the images, which are essential for effective harmonization. In this work, we propose a novel texture-aware StarGAN for CT data harmonization, enabling one-to-many translations across different reconstruction kernels. Although the StarGAN model has been successfully applied in other domains, its potential for CT data harmonization remains unexplored. Furthermore, our approach introduces a multi-scale texture loss function that embeds texture information across different spatial and angular scales into the harmonization process, effectively addressing kernel-induced texture variations. We conducted extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset, utilizing a total of 48667 chest CT slices from 197 patients distributed over three different reconstruction kernels, demonstrating the superiority of our method over the baseline StarGAN.</description>

      <title>Conjuring Positive Pairs for Efficient Unification of Representation Learning and Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand visual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive safety evaluation of the DeepSeek models, focusing on evaluating the safety risks associated with their generated content. Our evaluation encompasses DeepSeek's latest generation of large language models, multimodal large language models, and text-to-image models, systematically examining their performance regarding unsafe content generation. Notably, we developed a bilingual (Chinese-English) safety evaluation dataset tailored to Chinese sociocultural contexts, enabling a more thorough evaluation of the safety capabilities of Chinese-developed models. Experimental results indicate that despite their strong general capabilities, DeepSeek models exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions, including algorithmic discrimination and sexual content. These findings provide crucial insights for understanding and improving the safety of large foundation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/NY1024/DeepSeek-Safety-Eval.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Forecasting for Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Diffusion-Informed Model Predictive Control (D-I MPC), a generic framework for uncertainty-aware prediction and decision-making in partially observable stochastic systems by integrating diffusion-based time series forecasting models in Model Predictive Control algorithms. In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</description>

      <title>VIPER: Visual Perception and Explainable Reasoning for Sequential Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception, applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely open problem. In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning. Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal. We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities. Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</description>

      <title>Text-Derived Relational Graph-Enhanced Network for Skeleton-Based Action Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skeleton-based Temporal Action Segmentation (STAS) aims to segment and recognize various actions from long, untrimmed sequences of human skeletal movements. Current STAS methods typically employ spatio-temporal modeling to establish dependencies among joints as well as frames, and utilize one-hot encoding with cross-entropy loss for frame-wise classification supervision. However, these methods overlook the intrinsic correlations among joints and actions within skeletal features, leading to a limited understanding of human movements. To address this, we propose a Text-Derived Relational Graph-Enhanced Network (TRG-Net) that leverages prior graphs generated by Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance both modeling and supervision. For modeling, the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Fusion Modeling (DSFM) method incorporates Text-Derived Joint Graphs (TJG) with channel- and frame-level dynamic adaptation to effectively model spatial relations, while integrating spatio-temporal core features during temporal modeling. For supervision, the Absolute-Relative Inter-Class Supervision (ARIS) method employs contrastive learning between action features and text embeddings to regularize the absolute class distributions, and utilizes Text-Derived Action Graphs (TAG) to capture the relative inter-class relationships among action features. Additionally, we propose a Spatial-Aware Enhancement Processing (SAEP) method, which incorporates random joint occlusion and axial rotation to enhance spatial generalization. Performance evaluations on four public datasets demonstrate that TRG-Net achieves state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Robustness of the Fine-tuned Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the proliferation of LLMs, there have been concerns about their misuse for harmful content creation and spreading. Recent studies justify such fears, providing evidence of LLM vulnerabilities and high potential of their misuse. Humans are no longer able to distinguish between high-quality machine-generated and authentic human-written texts. Therefore, it is crucial to develop automated means to accurately detect machine-generated content. It would enable to identify such content in online information space, thus providing an additional information about its credibility. This work addresses the problem by proposing a robust fine-tuning process of LLMs for the detection task, making the detectors more robust against obfuscation and more generalizable to out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, popular functional frameworks and neural network formulations operate by making use of extrinsic error measurements and global learning algorithms. Through a set of conjectures based on evolutionary insights on the origin of cellular adaptive mechanisms, we reinterpret the core meaning of sensory signals to allow the brain to be interpreted as a negative feedback control system, and show how this could lead to local learning algorithms without the need for global error correction metrics. Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, and how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning in Hyperbolic vs. Euclidean Multimodal Contrastive Learning: Adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning methods have become increasingly important for selective concept removal in large pre-trained models. While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

      <title>Volumetric Reconstruction From Partial Views for Task-Oriented Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object affordance and volumetric information are essential in devising effective grasping strategies under task-specific constraints. This paper presents an approach for inferring suitable grasping strategies from limited partial views of an object. To achieve this, a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-GAN) was proposed by incorporating a recurrent generator with long short-term memory (LSTM) units for it to process a variable number of depth scans. To determine object affordances, the AffordPose knowledge dataset is utilized as prior knowledge. Affordance retrieving is defined by the volume similarity measured via Chamfer Distance and action similarities. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning model is further implemented to refine the retrieved grasp strategies for task-oriented grasping. The retrieved grasp strategies were evaluated on a dual-arm mobile manipulation robot with an overall grasping accuracy of 89% for four tasks: lift, handle grasp, wrap grasp, and press.</description>

      <title>Comparing Llama3 and DeepSeekR1 on Biomedical Text Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study compares the performance of two open-source large language models (LLMs)-Llama3-70B and DeepSeekR1-distill-Llama3-70B-on six biomedical text classification tasks. Four tasks involve data from social media, while two tasks focus on clinical notes from electronic health records, and all experiments were performed in zero-shot settings. Performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, were measured for each task, along with their 95% confidence intervals. Results demonstrated that DeepSeekR1-distill-Llama3-70B generally performs better in terms of precision on most tasks, with mixed results on recall. While the zero-shot LLMs demonstrated high F1 scores for some tasks, they grossly underperformed on others, for data from both sources. The findings suggest that model selection should be guided by the specific requirements of the health-related text classification tasks, particularly when considering the precision-recall trade-offs, and that, in the presence of annotated data, supervised classification approaches may be more reliable than zero-shot LLMs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Harmonic Annealing Pruning for Dynamic Spectrum Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing decentralized decision-making systems in complex settings, such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel sparse recurrent MARL framework integrating gradual neural network pruning into the independent actor global critic paradigm. Additionally, we introduce a harmonic annealing sparsity scheduler, which achieves comparable, and in certain cases superior, performance to standard linear and polynomial pruning schedulers at large sparsities. Our experimental investigation demonstrates that the proposed DSA framework can discover superior policies, under diverse training conditions, outperforming conventional DSA, MADRL baselines, and state-of-the-art pruning techniques.</description>

      <title>Foundation models may exhibit staged progression in novel CBRN threat disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which foundation models can disclose novel chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to expert users is unclear due to a lack of test cases. I leveraged the unique opportunity presented by an upcoming publication describing a novel catastrophic biothreat - "Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria: Feasibility and Risks" - to conduct a small controlled study before it became public. Graduate-trained biologists tasked with predicting the consequences of releasing mirror E. coli showed no significant differences in rubric-graded accuracy using Claude Sonnet 3.5 new (n=10) or web search only (n=2); both groups scored comparably to a web baseline (28 and 43 versus 36). However, Sonnet reasoned correctly when prompted by a report author, but a smaller model, Haiku 3.5, failed even with author guidance (80 versus 5). These results suggest distinct stages of model capability: Haiku is unable to reason about mirror life even with threat-aware expert guidance (Stage 1), while Sonnet correctly reasons only with threat-aware prompting (Stage 2). Continued advances may allow future models to disclose novel CBRN threats to naive experts (Stage 3) or unskilled users (Stage 4). While mirror life represents only one case study, monitoring new models' ability to reason about privately known threats may allow protective measures to be implemented before widespread disclosure.</description>

      <title>3D Occupancy Prediction with Low-Resolution Queries via Prototype-aware View Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resolution of voxel queries significantly influences the quality of view transformation in camera-based 3D occupancy prediction. However, computational constraints and the practical necessity for real-time deployment require smaller query resolutions, which inevitably leads to an information loss. Therefore, it is essential to encode and preserve rich visual details within limited query sizes while ensuring a comprehensive representation of 3D occupancy. To this end, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel occupancy network that leverages prototypes of clustered image segments in view transformation to enhance low-resolution context. In particular, the mapping of 2D prototypes onto 3D voxel queries encodes high-level visual geometries and complements the loss of spatial information from reduced query resolutions. Additionally, we design a multi-perspective decoding strategy to efficiently disentangle the densely compressed visual cues into a high-dimensional 3D occupancy scene. Experimental results on both Occ3D and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing clear improvements over the baselines. More importantly, ProtoOcc achieves competitive performance against the baselines even with 75\% reduced voxel resolution.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles, sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.</description>

      <title>When Pigs Get Sick: Multi-Agent AI for Swine Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swine disease surveillance is critical to the sustainability of global agriculture, yet its effectiveness is frequently undermined by limited veterinary resources, delayed identification of cases, and variability in diagnostic accuracy. To overcome these barriers, we introduce a novel AI-powered, multi-agent diagnostic system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver timely, evidence-based disease detection and clinical guidance. By automatically classifying user inputs into either Knowledge Retrieval Queries or Symptom-Based Diagnostic Queries, the system ensures targeted information retrieval and facilitates precise diagnostic reasoning. An adaptive questioning protocol systematically collects relevant clinical signs, while a confidence-weighted decision fusion mechanism integrates multiple diagnostic hypotheses to generate robust disease predictions and treatment recommendations. Comprehensive evaluations encompassing query classification, disease diagnosis, and knowledge retrieval demonstrate that the system achieves high accuracy, rapid response times, and consistent reliability. By providing a scalable, AI-driven diagnostic framework, this approach enhances veterinary decision-making, advances sustainable livestock management practices, and contributes substantively to the realization of global food security.</description>

      <title>A Personalized Data-Driven Generative Model of Human Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous virtual avatars (in extended reality) and robots in human group activities - such as rehabilitation therapy, sports, and manufacturing - is expected to increase as these technologies become more pervasive. Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior. In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique characteristics of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real data of scalar oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that our model effectively replicates the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, remaining different from other individuals, and outperforming state-of-the-art models in terms of similarity to human data.</description>

      <title>CoE: Chain-of-Explanation via Automatic Visual Concept Circuit Description and Polysemanticity Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is a critical factor influencing the wide deployment of deep vision models (DVMs). Concept-based post-hoc explanation methods can provide both global and local insights into model decisions. However, current methods in this field face challenges in that they are inflexible to automatically construct accurate and sufficient linguistic explanations for global concepts and local circuits. Particularly, the intrinsic polysemanticity in semantic Visual Concepts (VCs) impedes the interpretability of concepts and DVMs, which is underestimated severely. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Explanation (CoE) approach to address these issues. Specifically, CoE automates the decoding and description of VCs to construct global concept explanation datasets. Further, to alleviate the effect of polysemanticity on model explainability, we design a concept polysemanticity disentanglement and filtering mechanism to distinguish the most contextually relevant concept atoms. Besides, a Concept Polysemanticity Entropy (CPE), as a measure of model interpretability, is formulated to quantify the degree of concept uncertainty. The modeling of deterministic concepts is upgraded to uncertain concept atom distributions. Finally, CoE automatically enables linguistic local explanations of the decision-making process of DVMs by tracing the concept circuit. GPT-4o and human-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CPE and the superiority of CoE, achieving an average absolute improvement of 36% in terms of explainability scores.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models for Word Games:Who is the Spy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word games hold significant research value for natural language processing (NLP), game theory, and related fields due to their rule-based and situational nature. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be effectively involved in word games and proposes a training-free framework. "Shei Shi Wo Di" or "Who is the Spy" in English, is a classic word game. Using this game as an example, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based scheduling framework to enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance in tasks such as inferring role words and disguising their identities. We evaluate the framework's performance based on game success rates and the accuracy of the LLM agents' analytical results. Experimental results affirm the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating notable improvements in LLM performance across multiple datasets. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in mastering situational reasoning and social interactions within structured game environments.

      <title>BigO(Bench) -- Can LLMs Generate Code with Controlled Time and Space Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BigO(Bench), a novel coding benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of generative language models in understanding and generating code with specified time and space complexities. This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</description>

      <title>Automated Non-Functional Requirements Generation in Software Engineering with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neglecting non-functional requirements (NFRs) early in software development can lead to critical challenges. Despite their importance, NFRs are often overlooked or difficult to identify, impacting software quality. To support requirements engineers in eliciting NFRs, we developed a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive quality-driven NFRs from functional requirements (FRs). Using a custom prompting technique within a Deno-based pipeline, the system identifies relevant quality attributes for each functional requirement and generates corresponding NFRs, aiding systematic integration. A crucial aspect is evaluating the quality and suitability of these generated requirements. Can LLMs produce high-quality NFR suggestions? Using 34 functional requirements - selected as a representative subset of 3,964 FRs-the LLMs inferred applicable attributes based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standard, generating 1,593 NFRs. A horizontal evaluation covered three dimensions: NFR validity, applicability of quality attributes, and classification precision. Ten industry software quality evaluators, averaging 13 years of experience, assessed a subset for relevance and quality. The evaluation showed strong alignment between LLM-generated NFRs and expert assessments, with median validity and applicability scores of 5.0 (means: 4.63 and 4.59, respectively) on a 1-5 scale. In the classification task, 80.4% of LLM-assigned attributes matched expert choices, with 8.3% near misses and 11.3% mismatches. A comparative analysis of eight LLMs highlighted variations in performance, with gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting the highest attribute accuracy, while llama-3.3-70B achieved higher validity and applicability scores. These findings provide insights into the feasibility of using LLMs for automated NFR generation and lay the foundation for further exploration of AI-assisted requirements engineering.</description>

      <title>MAMM-Refine: A Recipe for Improving Faithfulness in Generation with Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration among models has shown promise in reasoning tasks but is underexplored in long-form generation tasks like summarization and question-answering. We extend multi-agent multi-model reasoning to generation, specifically to improving faithfulness through refinement, i.e., revising model-generated outputs to remove factual inconsistencies. We investigate how iterative collaboration among multiple instances and types of large language models (LLMs) enhances subtasks in the refinement process, such as error detection, critiquing unfaithful sentences, and making corrections based on critiques. We design intrinsic evaluations for each subtask, with our findings indicating that both multi-agent (multiple instances) and multi-model (diverse LLM types) approaches benefit error detection and critiquing. Additionally, reframing critiquing and refinement as reranking rather than generation tasks improves multi-agent performance. We consolidate these insights into a final "recipe" called Multi-Agent Multi-Model Refinement (MAMM-Refine), where multi-agent and multi-model collaboration significantly boosts performance on three summarization datasets as well as on long-form question answering, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our recipe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies and wearable devices, egocentric vision understanding has emerged as a new and challenging research direction, gradually attracting widespread attention from both academia and industry. Egocentric vision captures visual and multimodal data through cameras or sensors worn on the human body, offering a unique perspective that simulates human visual experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the research on egocentric vision understanding, systematically analyzing the components of egocentric scenes and categorizing the tasks into four main areas: subject understanding, object understanding, environment understanding, and hybrid understanding. We explore in detail the sub-tasks within each category. We also summarize the main challenges and trends currently existing in the field. Furthermore, this paper presents an overview of high-quality egocentric vision datasets, offering valuable resources for future research. By summarizing the latest advancements, we anticipate the broad applications of egocentric vision technologies in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence, and propose future research directions based on the latest developments in the field.</description>

      <title>TruthLens:A Training-Free Paradigm for DeepFake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of synthetic images generated by advanced AI models poses significant challenges in identifying and understanding manipulated visual content. Current fake image detection methods predominantly rely on binary classification models that focus on accuracy while often neglecting interpretability, leaving users without clear insights into why an image is deemed real or fake. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruthLens, a novel training-free framework that reimagines deepfake detection as a visual question-answering (VQA) task. TruthLens utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to observe and describe visual artifacts and combines this with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to analyze and aggregate evidence into informed decisions. By adopting a multimodal approach, TruthLens seamlessly integrates visual and semantic reasoning to not only classify images as real or fake but also provide interpretable explanations for its decisions. This transparency enhances trust and provides valuable insights into the artifacts that signal synthetic content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms conventional methods, achieving high accuracy on challenging datasets while maintaining a strong emphasis on explainability. By reframing deepfake detection as a reasoning-driven process, TruthLens establishes a new paradigm in combating synthetic media, combining cutting-edge performance with interpretability to address the growing threats of visual disinformation.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal alignment aims to construct a joint latent vector space where two modalities representing the same concept map to the same vector. We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that under certain conditions perfect alignment can be achieved. We then address a specific application of alignment referred to as cross-modal transfer. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer aims to leverage a model trained with one modality to perform inference on another modality, without any labeled fine-tuning on the new modality. Assuming that semantic classes are represented as a mixture of Gaussians in the latent space, we show how cross-modal transfer can be performed by projecting the data points from the representation space onto different subspaces representing each modality. Our experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment and cross-modal transfer method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of the applications of perfect alignment and the use of Gaussian models for cross-modal learning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on the \textit{Decompose-Then-Verify} paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity -- a novel metric quantifying information density -- leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims.</description>

      <title>Real-world validation of a multimodal LLM-powered pipeline for High-Accuracy Clinical Trial Patient Matching leveraging EHR data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data.
  Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.
  Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews.
  Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</description>

      <title>CCDP: Composition of Conditional Diffusion Policies with Guided Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation Learning offers a promising approach to learn directly from data without requiring explicit models, simulations, or detailed task definitions. During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem (which may require long-horizon history to manage failures) into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient keyword spotting using spike-based time difference encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting in edge devices is becoming increasingly important as voice-activated assistants are widely used. However, its deployment is often limited by the extreme low-power constraints of the target embedded systems. Here, we explore the Temporal Difference Encoder (TDE) performance in keyword spotting. This recent neuron model encodes the time difference in instantaneous frequency and spike count to perform efficient keyword spotting with neuromorphic processors. We use the TIdigits dataset of spoken digits with a formant decomposition and rate-based encoding into spikes. We compare three Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) architectures to learn and classify spatio-temporal signals. The proposed SNN architectures are made of three layers with variation in its hidden layer composed of either (1) feedforward TDE, (2) feedforward Current-Based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CuBa-LIF), or (3) recurrent CuBa-LIF neurons. We first show that the spike trains of the frequency-converted spoken digits have a large amount of information in the temporal domain, reinforcing the importance of better exploiting temporal encoding for such a task. We then train the three SNNs with the same number of synaptic weights to quantify and compare their performance based on the accuracy and synaptic operations. The resulting accuracy of the feedforward TDE network (89%) is higher than the feedforward CuBa-LIF network (71%) and close to the recurrent CuBa-LIF network (91%). However, the feedforward TDE-based network performs 92% fewer synaptic operations than the recurrent CuBa-LIF network with the same amount of synapses. In addition, the results of the TDE network are highly interpretable and correlated with the frequency and timescale features of the spoken keywords in the dataset. Our findings suggest that the TDE is a promising neuron model for scalable event-driven processing of spatio-temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>Automated Processing of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence Outputs in Deep Learning Models for Fault Diagnostics of Large Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) models processing images to recognize the health state of large infrastructure components can exhibit biases and rely on non-causal shortcuts. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can address these issues but manually analyzing explanations generated by XAI techniques is time-consuming and prone to errors. This work proposes a novel framework that combines post-hoc explanations with semi-supervised learning to automatically identify anomalous explanations that deviate from those of correctly classified images and may therefore indicate model abnormal behaviors. This significantly reduces the workload for maintenance decision-makers, who only need to manually reclassify images flagged as having anomalous explanations. The proposed framework is applied to drone-collected images of insulator shells for power grid infrastructure monitoring, considering two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), GradCAM explanations and Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection. The average classification accuracy on two faulty classes is improved by 8% and maintenance operators are required to manually reclassify only 15% of the images. We compare the proposed framework with a state-of-the-art approach based on the faithfulness metric: the experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves F_1 scores larger than those of the faithfulness-based approach. Additionally, the proposed framework successfully identifies correct classifications that result from non-causal shortcuts, such as the presence of ID tags printed on insulator shells.</description>

      <title>Temporal Regularization Makes Your Video Generator Stronger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal quality is a critical aspect of video generation, as it ensures consistent motion and realistic dynamics across frames. However, achieving high temporal coherence and diversity remains challenging. In this work, we explore temporal augmentation in video generation for the first time, and introduce FluxFlow for initial investigation, a strategy designed to enhance temporal quality. Operating at the data level, FluxFlow applies controlled temporal perturbations without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and VBench benchmarks demonstrate that FluxFlow significantly improves temporal coherence and diversity across various video generation models, including U-Net, DiT, and AR-based architectures, while preserving spatial fidelity. These findings highlight the potential of temporal augmentation as a simple yet effective approach to advancing video generation quality.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a general and flexible method for prompting a large language model (LLM) to reveal its (hidden) token input embedding up to homeomorphism. Moreover, this article provides strong theoretical justification -- a mathematical proof for generic LLMs -- for why this method should be expected to work. With this method in hand, we demonstrate its effectiveness by recovering the token subspace of Llemma-7B. The results of this paper apply not only to LLMs but also to general nonlinear autoregressive processes.</description>

      <title>Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms. The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues. The local VPP focuses on fine-grained localization by incorporating position-aware queries, which suggests probable object locations. We also introduce a VPP-SFT dataset with 0.6M samples, consolidating high-quality visual grounding data into a compact format for efficient model training. Training on this dataset with VPP enhances the model's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard grounding benchmarks despite using fewer training samples compared to other MLLMs like MiniGPT-v2, which rely on much larger datasets ($\sim$21M samples). The code and VPP-SFT dataset will be available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>An extensive simulation study evaluating the interaction of resampling techniques across multiple causal discovery contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the accelerating presence of exploratory causal analysis in modern science and medicine, the available non-experimental methods for validating causal models are not well characterized. One of the most popular methods is to evaluate the stability of model features after resampling the data, similar to resampling methods for estimating confidence intervals in statistics. Many aspects of this approach have received little to no attention, however, such as whether the choice of resampling method should depend on the sample size, algorithms being used, or algorithm tuning parameters. We present theoretical results proving that certain resampling methods closely emulate the assignment of specific values to algorithm tuning parameters. We also report the results of extensive simulation experiments, which verify the theoretical result and provide substantial data to aid researchers in further characterizing resampling in the context of causal discovery analysis. Together, the theoretical work and simulation results provide specific guidance on how resampling methods and tuning parameters should be selected in practice.</description>

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) has significantly influenced scientific domains beyond human language, including protein engineering, where pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success. However, interdisciplinary adoption remains limited due to challenges in data collection, task benchmarking, and application. This work presents VenusFactory, a versatile engine that integrates biological data retrieval, standardized task benchmarking, and modular fine-tuning of PLMs. VenusFactory supports both computer science and biology communities with choices of both a command-line execution and a Gradio-based no-code interface, integrating $40+$ protein-related datasets and $40+$ popular PLMs. All implementations are open-sourced on https://github.com/tyang816/VenusFactory.</description>

      <title>Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O: Distilling Masked Diffusion Models into One-step Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique. Despite their remarkable results, they typically suffer from slow inference with several steps. In this paper, we propose Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O, a novel approach that distills masked diffusion models into a one-step generator. Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O addresses two key challenges: (1) the intractability of using intermediate-step information for one-step generation, which we solve through token-level distribution matching that optimizes model output logits by an 'on-policy framework' with the help of an auxiliary model; and (2) the lack of entropy in the initial distribution, which we address through a token initialization strategy that injects randomness while maintaining similarity to teacher training distribution. We show Di$\mathtt{[M]}$O's effectiveness on both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation, impressively achieving performance competitive to multi-step teacher outputs while drastically reducing inference time. To our knowledge, we are the first to successfully achieve one-step distillation of masked diffusion models and the first to apply discrete distillation to text-to-image generation, opening new paths for efficient generative modeling.</description>

      <title>From 1,000,000 Users to Every User: Scaling Up Personalized Preference for User-level Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally been aligned through one-size-fits-all approaches that assume uniform human preferences, fundamentally overlooking the diversity in user values and needs. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for scalable personalized alignment of LLMs. We establish a systematic preference space characterizing psychological and behavioral dimensions, alongside diverse persona representations for robust preference inference in real-world scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we introduce \textsc{AlignX}, a large-scale dataset of over 1.3 million personalized preference examples, and develop two complementary alignment approaches: \textit{in-context alignment} directly conditioning on persona representations and \textit{preference-bridged alignment} modeling intermediate preference distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, with an average 17.06\% accuracy gain across four benchmarks while exhibiting a strong adaptation capability to novel preferences, robustness to limited user data, and precise preference controllability. These results validate our framework's effectiveness, advancing toward truly user-adaptive AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>EgoDTM: Towards 3D-Aware Egocentric Video-Language Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric video-language pretraining has significantly advanced video representation learning. Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoDTM.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Piano in the Real World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots, playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .</description>

      <title>Value Profiles for Encoding Human Variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using value profiles -- natural language descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings conditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (&gt;70% information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.</description>

      <title>TULIP: Towards Unified Language-Image Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

      <title>E2ETune: End-to-End Knob Tuning via Fine-tuned Generative Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators, as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework to efficiently produce a large amount of training data, where each data sample consists of a workload and its promising configuration. Then, these data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner. This tuner offers out-of-the-box configuration recommendations for new workloads. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's efficiency and effectiveness using 10 representative and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune can identify competitive configurations in significantly less time.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent cooperation through learning-aware policy gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interested individuals often fail to cooperate, posing a fundamental challenge for multi-agent learning. How can we achieve cooperation among self-interested, independent learning agents? Promising recent work has shown that in certain tasks cooperation can be established between learning-aware agents who model the learning dynamics of each other. Here, we present the first unbiased, higher-derivative-free policy gradient algorithm for learning-aware reinforcement learning, which takes into account that other agents are themselves learning through trial and error based on multiple noisy trials. We then leverage efficient sequence models to condition behavior on long observation histories that contain traces of the learning dynamics of other agents. Training long-context policies with our algorithm leads to cooperative behavior and high returns on standard social dilemmas, including a challenging environment where temporally-extended action coordination is required. Finally, we derive from the iterated prisoner's dilemma a novel explanation for how and when cooperation arises among self-interested learning-aware agents.</description>

      <title>ASP-based Multi-shot Reasoning via DLV2 with Incremental Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DLV2 is an AI tool for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning which supports Answer Set Programming (ASP) - a logic-based declarative formalism, successfully used in both academic and industrial applications. Given a logic program modelling a computational problem, an execution of DLV2 produces the so-called answer sets that correspond one-to-one to the solutions to the problem at hand. The computational process of DLV2 relies on the typical Ground &amp; Solve approach where the grounding step transforms the input program into a new, equivalent ground program, and the subsequent solving step applies propositional algorithms to search for the answer sets. Recently, emerging applications in contexts such as stream reasoning and event processing created a demand for multi-shot reasoning: here, the system is expected to be reactive while repeatedly executed over rapidly changing data. In this work, we present a new incremental reasoner obtained from the evolution of DLV2 towards iterated reasoning. Rather than restarting the computation from scratch, the system remains alive across repeated shots, and it incrementally handles the internal grounding process. At each shot, the system reuses previous computations for building and maintaining a large, more general ground program, from which a smaller yet equivalent portion is determined and used for computing answer sets. Notably, the incremental process is performed in a completely transparent fashion for the user. We describe the system, its usage, its applicability and performance in some practically relevant domains. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</description>

      <title>Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing complex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on enhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such approaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability to recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and expensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique datasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent capabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework, Agent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional methods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages MCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from erroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for timely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address this, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor model identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a failed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct path, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the model to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding better learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this self-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error correction capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that Agent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and enables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments show that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while avoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods (+5.59%).</description>

      <title>Learning to Negotiate via Voluntary Commitment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method compared with its counterparts.

      <title>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</description>

      <title>KG-IRAG: A Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</description>

      <title>Neuron-based explanations of neural networks sacrifice completeness and interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.03043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High quality explanations of neural networks (NNs) should exhibit two key properties. Completeness ensures that they accurately reflect a network's function and interpretability makes them understandable to humans. Many existing methods provide explanations of individual neurons within a network. In this work we provide evidence that for AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet, neuron-based explanation methods sacrifice both completeness and interpretability compared to activation principal components. Neurons are a poor basis for AlexNet embeddings because they don't account for the distributed nature of these representations. By examining two quantitative measures of completeness and conducting a user study to measure interpretability, we show the most important principal components provide more complete and interpretable explanations than the most important neurons. Much of the activation variance may be explained by examining relatively few high-variance PCs, as opposed to studying every neuron. These principal components also strongly affect network function, and are significantly more interpretable than neurons. Our findings suggest that explanation methods for networks like AlexNet should avoid using neurons as a basis for embeddings and instead choose a basis, such as principal components, which accounts for the high dimensional and distributed nature of a network's internal representations.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly influences decisions in critical societal sectors, understanding and establishing causality becomes essential for evaluating the fairness of automated systems. This article explores the significance of causal reasoning in addressing algorithmic discrimination, emphasizing both legal and societal perspectives. By reviewing landmark cases and regulatory frameworks, particularly within the European Union, we illustrate the challenges inherent in proving causal claims when confronted with opaque AI decision-making processes. The discussion outlines practical obstacles and methodological limitations in applying causal inference to real-world fairness scenarios, proposing actionable solutions to enhance transparency, accountability, and fairness in algorithm-driven decisions.</description>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series continue to make strides, we witness the emergence of artificial intelligence applications in an ever-expanding range of fields. In medicine, these LLMs hold considerable promise for improving medical workflows, diagnostics, patient care, and education. Yet, there is an urgent need for open-source models that can be deployed on-premises to safeguard patient privacy. In our work, we present an innovative dataset consisting of over 160,000 entries, specifically crafted to fine-tune LLMs for effective medical applications. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning these datasets on publicly accessible pre-trained LLMs, and subsequently, we juxtapose the performance of pre-trained-only models against the fine-tuned models concerning the examinations that future medical doctors must pass to achieve certification.</description>

      <title>Bloated Disclosures: Can ChatGPT Help Investors Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can fundamentally change the way investors process information. We probe the economic usefulness of these tools in summarizing complex corporate disclosures using the stock market as a laboratory. The unconstrained summaries are remarkably shorter compared to the originals, whereas their information content is amplified. When a document has a positive (negative) sentiment, its summary becomes more positive (negative). Importantly, the summaries are more effective at explaining stock market reactions to the disclosed information. Motivated by these findings, we propose a measure of information ``bloat." We show that bloated disclosure is associated with adverse capital market consequences, such as lower price efficiency and higher information asymmetry. Finally, we show that the model is effective at constructing targeted summaries that identify firms' (non-)financial performance. Collectively, our results indicate that generative AI adds considerable value for investors with information processing constraints.</description>

      <title>From Transcripts to Insights: Uncovering Corporate Risks Using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the value of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, in helping investors uncover dimensions of corporate risk. We develop and validate firm-level measures of risk exposure to political, climate, and AI-related risks. Using the GPT 3.5 model to generate risk summaries and assessments from the context provided by earnings call transcripts, we show that GPT-based measures possess significant information content and outperform the existing risk measures in predicting (abnormal) firm-level volatility and firms' choices such as investment and innovation. Importantly, information in risk assessments dominates that in risk summaries, establishing the value of general AI knowledge. We also find that generative AI is effective at detecting emerging risks, such as AI risk, which has soared in recent quarters. Our measures perform well both within and outside the GPT's training window and are priced in equity markets. Taken together, an AI-based approach to risk measurement provides useful insights to users of corporate disclosures at a low cost.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Mixup to Data for Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among all data augmentation techniques proposed so far, linear interpolation of training samples, also called Mixup, has found to be effective for a large panel of applications. Along with improved predictive performance, Mixup is also a good technique for improving calibration. However, mixing data carelessly can lead to manifold mismatch, i.e., synthetic data lying outside original class manifolds, which can deteriorate calibration. In this work, we show that the likelihood of assigning a wrong label with mixup increases with the distance between data to mix. To this end, we propose to dynamically change the underlying distributions of interpolation coefficients depending on the similarity between samples to mix, and define a flexible framework to do so without losing in diversity. We provide extensive experiments for classification and regression tasks, showing that our proposed method improves predictive performance and calibration of models, while being much more efficient.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Active Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in machine learning where evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</description>

      <title>Probabilities of Chat LLMs Are Miscalibrated but Still Predict Correctness on Multiple-Choice Q&amp;A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 15 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&amp;A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigorous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&amp;A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.</description>

      <title>SPTNet: An Efficient Alternative Framework for Generalized Category Discovery with Spatial Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled `seen' class images. A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

      <title>Augmented Object Intelligence: Making the Analog World Interactable with XR-Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seamless integration of physical objects as interactive digital entities remains a challenge for spatial computing. This paper introduces Augmented Object Intelligence (AOI), a novel XR interaction paradigm designed to blur the lines between digital and physical by equipping real-world objects with the ability to interact as if they were digital, where every object has the potential to serve as a portal to vast digital functionalities. Our approach utilizes object segmentation and classification, combined with the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to facilitate these interactions. We implement the AOI concept in the form of XR-Objects, an open-source prototype system that provides a platform for users to engage with their physical environment in rich and contextually relevant ways. This system enables analog objects to not only convey information but also to initiate digital actions, such as querying for details or executing tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we define the AOI concept and detail its advantages over traditional AI assistants, (2) detail the XR-Objects system's open-source design and implementation, and (3) show its versatility through a variety of use cases and a user study.</description>

      <title>Paint by Inpaint: Learning to Add Image Objects by Removing Them First</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image editing has advanced significantly with the introduction of text-conditioned diffusion models. Despite this progress, seamlessly adding objects to images based on textual instructions without requiring user-provided input masks remains a challenge. We address this by leveraging the insight that removing objects (Inpaint) is significantly simpler than its inverse process of adding them (Paint), attributed to inpainting models that benefit from segmentation mask guidance. Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

      <title>Language Model Council: Democratically Benchmarking Foundation Models on Highly Subjective Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, evaluating them remains a persistent challenge. Many recent evaluations use LLMs as judges to score outputs from other LLMs, often relying on a single large model like GPT-4o. However, using a single LLM judge is prone to intra-model bias, and many tasks - such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, and persuasiveness - may be too subjective for a single model to judge fairly. We introduce the Language Model Council (LMC), where a group of LLMs collaborate to create tests, respond to them, and evaluate each other's responses to produce a ranking in a democratic fashion. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing cost or bias by using a panel of smaller models, our work examines the benefits and nuances of a fully inclusive LLM evaluation system. In a detailed case study on emotional intelligence, we deploy a council of 20 recent LLMs to rank each other on open-ended responses to interpersonal conflicts. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable and more robust, and through a user study, we show that they are more consistent with human evaluations than any individual LLM judge. Using all LLMs for judging can be costly, however, so we use Monte Carlo simulations and hand-curated sub-councils to study hypothetical council compositions and discuss the value of the incremental LLM judge.</description>

      <title>Assessing AI vs Human-Authored Spear Phishing SMS Attacks: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in spear phishing message generation and evaluates their performance compared to human-authored counterparts. Our pilot study examines the effectiveness of smishing (SMS phishing) messages created by GPT-4 and human authors, which have been personalized for willing targets. The targets assessed these messages in a modified ranked-order experiment using a novel methodology we call TRAPD (Threshold Ranking Approach for Personalized Deception). Experiments involved ranking each spear phishing message from most to least convincing, providing qualitative feedback, and guessing which messages were human- or AI-generated. Results show that LLM-generated messages are often perceived as more convincing than those authored by humans, particularly job-related messages. Targets also struggled to distinguish between human- and AI-generated messages. We analyze different criteria the targets used to assess the persuasiveness and source of messages. This study aims to highlight the urgent need for further research and improved countermeasures against personalized AI-enabled social engineering attacks.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Have Distinct and Consistent Personality? TRAIT: Personality Testset designed for LLMs with Psychometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their adaptation in various domains as conversational agents. We wonder: can personality tests be applied to these agents to analyze their behavior, similar to humans? We introduce TRAIT, a new benchmark consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs. TRAIT is built on two psychometrically validated small human questionnaires, Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3), enhanced with the ATOMIC-10X knowledge graph to a variety of real-world scenarios. TRAIT also outperforms existing personality tests for LLMs in terms of reliability and validity, achieving the highest scores across four key metrics: Content Validity, Internal Validity, Refusal Rate, and Reliability. Using TRAIT, we reveal two notable insights into personalities of LLMs: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality, which is highly influenced by their training data (e.g., data used for alignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Restyling Unsupervised Concept Based Interpretable Networks with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing inherently interpretable models for prediction has gained prominence in recent years. A subclass of these models, wherein the interpretable network relies on learning high-level concepts, are valued because of closeness of concept representations to human communication. However, the visualization and understanding of the learnt unsupervised dictionary of concepts encounters major limitations, especially for large-scale images. We propose here a novel method that relies on mapping the concept features to the latent space of a pretrained generative model. The use of a generative model enables high quality visualization, and lays out an intuitive and interactive procedure for better interpretation of the learnt concepts by imputing concept activations and visualizing generated modifications. Furthermore, leveraging pretrained generative models has the additional advantage of making the training of the system more efficient. We quantitatively ascertain the efficacy of our method in terms of accuracy of the interpretable prediction network, fidelity of reconstruction, as well as faithfulness and consistency of learnt concepts. The experiments are conducted on multiple image recognition benchmarks for large-scale images. Project page available at https://jayneelparekh.github.io/VisCoIN_project_page/</description>

      <title>Frequency and Generalisation of Periodic Activation Functions in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic activation functions, often referred to as learned Fourier features have been widely demonstrated to improve sample efficiency and stability in a variety of deep RL algorithms. Potentially incompatible hypotheses have been made about the source of these improvements. One is that periodic activations learn low frequency representations and as a result avoid overfitting to bootstrapped targets. Another is that periodic activations learn high frequency representations that are more expressive, allowing networks to quickly fit complex value functions. We analyse these claims empirically, finding that periodic representations consistently converge to high frequencies regardless of their initialisation frequency. We also find that while periodic activation functions improve sample efficiency, they exhibit worse generalization on states with added observation noise -- especially when compared to otherwise equivalent networks with ReLU activation functions. Finally, we show that weight decay regularization is able to partially offset the overfitting of periodic activation functions, delivering value functions that learn quickly while also generalizing.</description>

      <title>DAHRS: Divergence-Aware Hallucination-Remediated SRL Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) enriches many downstream applications, e.g., machine translation, question answering, summarization, and stance/belief detection. However, building multilingual SRL models is challenging due to the scarcity of semantically annotated corpora for multiple languages. Moreover, state-of-the-art SRL projection (XSRL) based on large language models (LLMs) yields output that is riddled with spurious role labels. Remediation of such hallucinations is not straightforward due to the lack of explainability of LLMs. We show that hallucinated role labels are related to naturally occurring divergence types that interfere with initial alignments. We implement Divergence-Aware Hallucination-Remediated SRL projection (DAHRS), leveraging linguistically-informed alignment remediation followed by greedy First-Come First-Assign (FCFA) SRL projection. DAHRS improves the accuracy of SRL projection without additional transformer-based machinery, beating XSRL in both human and automatic comparisons, and advancing beyond headwords to accommodate phrase-level SRL projection (e.g., EN-FR, EN-ES). Using CoNLL-2009 as our ground truth, we achieve a higher word-level F1 over XSRL: 87.6% vs. 77.3% (EN-FR) and 89.0% vs. 82.7% (EN-ES). Human phrase-level assessments yield 89.1% (EN-FR) and 91.0% (EN-ES). We also define a divergence metric to adapt our approach to other language pairs (e.g., English-Tagalog).</description>

      <title>ReAttention: Training-Free Infinite Context with Finite Attention Scope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-context capability of the Large Language Models (LLM) has made significant breakthroughs, but the maximum supported context length in length extrapolation remains a critical bottleneck limiting their practical applications. The constraint of context length in LLMs arises from the self-attention mechanism, which cannot effectively and efficiently capture the semantic relationships within infinitely long contexts via the limited pre-trained positional information and attention scope. In this work, we propose ReAttention, a training-free approach enabling LLM based on the self-attention mechanism to support an infinite context with a finite attention scope under sufficient memory resources. ReAttention performs the position-agnostic top-$k$ attention before the ordinary position-aware self-attention, freeing LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate the performance of ReAttention on the LongBench, L-Eval, and InfiniteBench and demonstrate that it is on par with traditional methods. Furthermore, we also apply ReAttention on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B and Mistral-v0.3-7B, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 1M and even expanding the context length of LLaMA3.2-3B-chat by 128$\times$ to 4M without any further training in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We also improve the efficiency of ReAttention with Triton and achieve an efficient extrapolation without additional overhead.

      <title>ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of in-context learning and prompt engineering to estimate the contributions of training data in the outputs of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). We propose two novel approaches: (1) a similarity-based approach that measures the difference between LLM outputs with and without provided context, and (2) a mixture distribution model approach that frames the problem of identifying contribution scores as a matrix factorization task. Our empirical comparison demonstrates that the mixture model approach is more robust to retrieval noise in in-context learning, providing a more reliable estimation of data contributions.</description>

      <title>Smooth InfoMax -- Towards easier Post-Hoc interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Smooth InfoMax (SIM), a novel method for self-supervised representation learning that incorporates an interpretability constraint into the learned representations at various depths of the neural network. SIM's architecture is split up into probabilistic modules, each locally optimized using the InfoNCE bound. Inspired by VAEs, the representations from these modules are designed to be samples from Gaussian distributions and are further constrained to be close to the standard normal distribution. This results in a smooth and predictable space, enabling traversal of the latent space through a decoder for easier post-hoc analysis of the learned representations. We evaluate SIM's performance on sequential speech data, showing that it performs competitively with its less interpretable counterpart, Greedy InfoMax (GIM). Moreover, we provide insights into SIM's internal representations, demonstrating that the contained information is less entangled throughout the representation and more concentrated in a smaller subset of the dimensions. This further highlights the improved interpretability of SIM.</description>

      <title>Towards the Pedagogical Steering of Large Language Models for Tutoring: A Case Study with Modeling Productive Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-to-one tutoring is one of the most efficient methods of teaching. With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to create LLM based conversational tutors which can expand the benefits of one to one tutoring to everyone. However, current LLMs are trained primarily to be helpful assistants and lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi turn pedagogical interaction. To use LLMs in pedagogical settings, they need to be steered to use effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering. We develop StratL, an algorithm to optimize LLM prompts and steer it to follow a predefined multi-turn tutoring plan represented as a transition graph. As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design. To validate our approach in a real-world setting, we run a field study with 17 high school students in Singapore and show that StratL succeeds in steering the LLM to follow the PF tutoring strategy. Finally, we highlight challenges in Pedagogical Steering of LLMs and offer opportunities for further improvements by publishing a dataset of PF problems and our code.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Explanations That Anticipate Human Misconceptions Can Improve Human Decision-Making Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's decision-making abilities often fail to improve or may even erode when they rely on AI for decision-support, even when the AI provides informative explanations. We argue this is partly because people intuitively seek contrastive explanations, which clarify the difference between the AI's decision and their own reasoning, while most AI systems offer "unilateral" explanations that justify the AI's decision but do not account for users' thinking. To align human-AI knowledge on decision tasks, we introduce a framework for generating human-centered contrastive explanations that explain the difference between AI's choice and a predicted, likely human choice about the same task. Results from a large-scale experiment (N = 628) demonstrate that contrastive explanations significantly enhance users' independent decision-making skills compared to unilateral explanations, without sacrificing decision accuracy. Amid rising deskilling concerns, our research demonstrates that incorporating human reasoning into AI design can foster human skill development.</description>

      <title>Skin Cancer Machine Learning Model Tone Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Many open-source skin cancer image datasets are the result of clinical trials conducted in countries with lighter skin tones. Due to this tone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform well at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these models could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the artificial intelligence health field.
  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a significant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias. To address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional neural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then evaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to dark or light skin tone.
  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in a disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the model is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter versus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or balanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well below the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with respect to skin tone.
  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models can be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone imbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to identify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.</description>

      <title>SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). Our code, data, and model is publicly accessible at https://uni-medical.github.io/SlideChat.github.io.</description>

      <title>From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</description>

      <title>RepoGraph: Enhancing AI Software Engineering with Repository-level Code Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation yet struggle with modern AI software engineering tasks. Unlike traditional function-level or file-level coding tasks, AI software engineering requires not only basic coding proficiency but also advanced skills in managing and interacting with code repositories. However, existing methods often overlook the need for repository-level code understanding, which is crucial for accurately grasping the broader context and developing effective solutions. On this basis, we present RepoGraph, a plug-in module that manages a repository-level structure for modern AI software engineering solutions. RepoGraph offers the desired guidance and serves as a repository-wide navigation for AI software engineers. We evaluate RepoGraph on the SWE-bench by plugging it into four different methods of two lines of approaches, where RepoGraph substantially boosts the performance of all systems, leading to a new state-of-the-art among open-source frameworks. Our analyses also demonstrate the extensibility and flexibility of RepoGraph by testing on another repo-level coding benchmark, CrossCodeEval. Our code is available at https://github.com/ozyyshr/RepoGraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming is becoming increasingly popular thanks to its ability to specify problems with a certain degree of uncertainty. In this work, we focus on term rewriting, a well-known computational formalism. In particular, we consider systems that combine traditional rewriting rules with probabilities. Then, we define a novel "distribution semantics" for such systems that can be used to model the probability of reducing a term to some value. We also show how to compute a set of "explanations" for a given reduction, which can be used to compute its probability in a more efficient way. Finally, we illustrate our approach with several examples and outline a couple of extensions that may prove useful to improve the expressive power of probabilistic rewrite systems.</description>

      <title>JMMMU: A Japanese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark for Culture-aware Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerating research on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in non-English languages is crucial for enhancing user experiences across broader populations. In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on the Japanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware evaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA) subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and translated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English counterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly crafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset, we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is purely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their inadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets, we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS subset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks depth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance LMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create high-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.

      <title>Bonsai: Gradient-free Graph Distillation for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph distillation has emerged as a promising avenue to enable scalable training of GNNs by compressing the training dataset while preserving essential graph characteristics. Our study uncovers significant shortcomings in current graph distillation techniques. First, the majority of the algorithms paradoxically require training on the full dataset to perform distillation. Second, due to their gradient-emulating approach, these methods require fresh distillation for any change in hyperparameters or GNN architecture, limiting their flexibility and reusability. Finally, they fail to achieve substantial size reduction due to synthesizing fully-connected, edge-weighted graphs. To address these challenges, we present Bonsai, a novel graph distillation method empowered by the observation that \textit{computation trees} form the fundamental processing units of message-passing GNNs. Bonsai distills datasets by encoding a careful selection of \textit{exemplar} trees that maximize the representation of all computation trees in the training set. This unique approach imparts Bonsai as the first linear-time, model-agnostic graph distillation algorithm for node classification that outperforms existing baselines across $6$ real-world datasets on accuracy, while being $22$ times faster on average. Bonsai is grounded in rigorous mathematical guarantees on the adopted approximation strategies making it robust to GNN architectures, datasets, and parameters.</description>

      <title>LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Developer Perspectives on Licensing and Copyright Issues Arising from Generative AI for Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the utility that Generative AI (GenAI) tools provide for tasks such as writing code, the use of these tools raises important legal questions and potential risks, particularly those associated with copyright law. As lawmakers and regulators engage with those questions, the views of users can provide relevant perspectives. In this paper, we provide: (1) a survey of 574 developers on the licensing and copyright aspects of GenAI for coding, as well as follow-up interviews; (2) a snapshot of developers' views at a time when GenAI and perceptions of it are rapidly evolving; and (3) an analysis of developers' views, yielding insights and recommendations that can inform future regulatory decisions in this evolving field. Our results show the benefits developers derive from GenAI, how they view the use of AI-generated code as similar to using other existing code, the varied opinions they have on who should own or be compensated for such code, that they are concerned about data leakage via GenAI, and much more, providing organizations and policymakers with valuable insights into how the technology is being used and what concerns stakeholders would like to see addressed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the automatic segmentation and analysis of 3D liver vasculature models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>Pathways on the Image Manifold: Image Editing via Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

      <title>DEIM: DETR with Improved Matching for Fast Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DEIM, an innovative and efficient training framework designed to accelerate convergence in real-time object detection with Transformer-based architectures (DETR). To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.</description>

      <title>RoomTour3D: Geometry-Aware Video-Instruction Tuning for Embodied Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) suffers from the limited diversity and scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos, we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and 3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.</description>

      <title>ANaGRAM: A Natural Gradient Relative to Adapted Model for efficient PINNs learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have received strong interest as a method to solve PDE driven systems, in particular for data assimilation purpose. This method is still in its infancy, with many shortcomings and failures that remain not properly understood. In this paper we propose a natural gradient approach to PINNs which contributes to speed-up and improve the accuracy of the training. Based on an in depth analysis of the differential geometric structures of the problem, we come up with two distinct contributions: (i) a new natural gradient algorithm that scales as $\min(P^2S, S^2P)$, where $P$ is the number of parameters, and $S$ the batch size; (ii) a mathematically principled reformulation of the PINNs problem that allows the extension of natural gradient to it, with proved connections to Green's function theory.</description>

      <title>Scam Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts: Leveraging Graph Representation Learning for Secure Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As more and more attacks have been detected on Ethereum smart contracts, it has seriously affected finance and credibility. Current anti-fraud detection techniques, including code parsing or manual feature extraction, still have some shortcomings, although some generalization or adaptability can be obtained. In the face of this situation, this paper proposes to use graphical representation learning technology to find transaction patterns and distinguish malicious transaction contracts, that is, to represent Ethereum transaction data as graphs, and then use advanced ML technology to obtain reliable and accurate results. Taking into account the sample imbalance, we treated with SMOTE-ENN and tested several models, in which MLP performed better than GCN, but the exact effect depends on its field trials. Our research opens up more possibilities for trust and security in the Ethereum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Subversion Strategy Eval: Can language models statelessly strategize to subvert control protocols?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An AI control protocol is a plan for usefully deploying AI systems that prevents an AI from intentionally causing some unacceptable outcome. Previous work evaluated protocols by subverting them using an AI following a human-written strategy. This paper investigates how well AI systems can generate and act on their own strategies for subverting control protocols whilst operating statelessly (without shared memory between contexts). To do this, an AI system may need to reliably generate optimal plans in each context, take actions with well-calibrated probabilities, and coordinate plans with other instances of itself without communicating. We develop Subversion Strategy Eval, a suite of eight environments, covering a range of protocols and strategic capabilities, and six sets of affordances that help isolate individual capabilities. We implement the evaluation in Inspect-AI and release it open-source. We evaluate Claude 3.5 models, including helpful-only versions, as well as OpenAI reasoning models. None of the models demonstrate substantial capability in strategizing to subvert control protocols statelessly. However, providing models with additional affordances, such as the ability to share a plan between contexts, can substantially improve performance. We hope our evaluations can act as a leading indicator for when models are capable of subverting control protocols and also relax the worst-case assumption of perfect strategic ability in AI control evaluations.</description>

      <title>MaskHand: Generative Masked Modeling for Robust Hand Mesh Reconstruction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D hand mesh from a single RGB image is challenging due to complex articulations, self-occlusions, and depth ambiguities. Traditional discriminative methods, which learn a deterministic mapping from a 2D image to a single 3D mesh, often struggle with the inherent ambiguities in 2D-to-3D mapping. To address this challenge, we propose MaskHand, a novel generative masked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes by learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous 2D-to-3D mapping process. MaskHand consists of two key components: (1) a VQ-MANO, which encodes 3D hand articulations as discrete pose tokens in a latent space, and (2) a Context-Guided Masked Transformer that randomly masks out pose tokens and learns their joint distribution, conditioned on corrupted token sequence, image context, and 2D pose cues. This learned distribution facilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh reconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision. Extensive evaluations on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that MaskHand achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and realism in 3D hand mesh reconstruction.

      <title>FiVL: A Framework for Improved Vision-Language Alignment through the Lens of Training, Evaluation and Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in integrating visual and textual inputs for multimodal reasoning. However, a recurring challenge is ensuring these models utilize visual information as effectively as linguistic content when both modalities are necessary to formulate an accurate answer. We hypothesize that hallucinations arise due to the lack of effective visual grounding in current LVLMs. Furthermore, current vision-language benchmarks are not specifically measuring the degree to which the answer require the visual input. This limitation makes it challenging to confirm that the image is truly necessary, particularly in tasks like visual question answering. In this work, we introduce FiVL, a novel method for constructing datasets designed to train LVLMs for enhanced visual grounding and also evaluate their effectiveness in achieving it. We demonstrate the value of our datasets through three approaches. First, we introduce a novel training task based on our augmented training dataset, resulting in better performance than the baseline. Second, we present benchmarks to assess the model's ability to use image as substantive evidence, rather than relying solely on linguistic priors. Finally, we identify attention heads with the strongest vision-language alignment, enabling explainability on visual-driven hallucinations. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/fivl.</description>

      <title>Context Clues: Evaluating Long Context Models for Clinical Prediction Tasks on EHRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks. However, most existing EHR FMs have context windows of &lt;1k tokens. This prevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events. Recent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g., Mamba) offer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been well-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation of the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer context models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction benchmark. For clinical applications, however, model performance alone is insufficient -- robustness to the unique properties of EHR is crucial. Thus, we also evaluate models across three previously underexplored properties of EHR data: (1) the prevalence of "copy-forwarded" diagnoses which creates artificial repetition of tokens within EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals between EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context window; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which makes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying our EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate negatively with model performance, but that longer context models are more robust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the potential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a case study for identifying new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated by domains outside of natural language. We release our models and code at: https://github.com/som-shahlab/long_context_clues</description>

      <title>The Impact of Input Order Bias on Large Language Models for Software Fault Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software engineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths appear first) and "worst" (where ground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python projects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL accuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs into smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL from 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names with semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due to data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the bias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the inherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as CallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs, managing context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to enhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Lightweight Meta-Embedding for ID-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art recommendation systems have shifted the attention to efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory constraints. To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</description>

      <title>Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Pipeline for Fully Automated Myocardial Infarct Segmentation from Clinical Cardiac MR Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based method that allows to perform myocardial infarct segmentation in a fully-automated way.
  Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, a cascaded framework of two and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specialized on identifying ischemic myocardial scars on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, was trained on an in-house training dataset consisting of 144 examinations. On a separate test dataset from the same institution, including images from 152 examinations obtained between 2021 and 2023, a quantitative comparison between artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentations and manual segmentations was performed. Further, qualitative assessment of segmentation accuracy was evaluated for both human and AI-generated contours by two CMR experts in a blinded experiment.
  Results: Excellent agreement could be found between manually and automatically calculated infarct volumes ($\rho_c$ = 0.9). The qualitative evaluation showed that compared to human-based measurements, the experts rated the AI-based segmentations to better represent the actual extent of infarction significantly (p &lt; 0.001) more often (33.4% AI, 25.1% human, 41.5% equal). On the contrary, for segmentation of microvascular obstruction (MVO), manual measurements were still preferred (11.3% AI, 55.6% human, 33.1% equal).
  Conclusion: This fully-automated segmentation pipeline enables CMR infarct size to be calculated in a very short time and without requiring any pre-processing of the input images while matching the segmentation quality of trained human observers. In a blinded experiment, experts preferred automated infarct segmentations more often than manual segmentations, paving the way for a potential clinical application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</description>

      <title>Speculate, then Collaborate: Fusing Knowledge of Language Models during Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often excel in specific domains but fall short in others due to the limitations of their training. Thus, enabling LLMs to solve problems collaboratively by integrating their complementary knowledge promises to improve their performance across domains. To realize this potential, we introduce a novel Collaborative Speculative Decoding (CoSD) algorithm that enables efficient LLM knowledge fusion at test time without requiring additional model training. CoSD employs a draft model to generate initial sequences and an easy-to-learn rule or decision tree to decide when to invoke an assistant model to improve these drafts. CoSD not only enhances knowledge fusion but also improves inference efficiency, is transferable across domains and models, and offers greater explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSD improves accuracy by up to 10\% across benchmarks compared to existing methods, providing a scalable and effective solution for LLM-based applications</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional foundation models are pre-trained on broad datasets to reduce the training resources (e.g., time, energy, labeled samples) needed for fine-tuning a wide range of downstream tasks. However, traditional foundation models struggle with out-of-distribution prediction and can produce outputs that are unrealistic and physically infeasible. We propose the notation of physics-guided foundation models (PGFM), that is, foundation models integrated with broad or general domain (e.g., scientific) physical knowledge applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>MedVLM-R1: Incentivizing Medical Reasoning Capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is a critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where transparency and trustworthiness play a central role in both clinician trust and regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show promise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers without revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce MedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training distributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover human-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references. Despite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model parameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI, CT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million samples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under out-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit reasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable AI in clinical practice.

      <title>The PanAf-FGBG Dataset: Understanding the Impact of Backgrounds in Wildlife Behaviour Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer vision analysis of camera trap video footage is essential for wildlife conservation, as captured behaviours offer some of the earliest indicators of changes in population health. Recently, several high-impact animal behaviour datasets and methods have been introduced to encourage their use; however, the role of behaviour-correlated background information and its significant effect on out-of-distribution generalisation remain unexplored. In response, we present the PanAf-FGBG dataset, featuring 20 hours of wild chimpanzee behaviours, recorded at over 350 individual camera locations. Uniquely, it pairs every video with a chimpanzee (referred to as a foreground video) with a corresponding background video (with no chimpanzee) from the same camera location. We present two views of the dataset: one with overlapping camera locations and one with disjoint locations. This setup enables, for the first time, direct evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditions, and for the impact of backgrounds on behaviour recognition models to be quantified. All clips come with rich behavioural annotations and metadata including unique camera IDs and detailed textual scene descriptions. Additionally, we establish several baselines and present a highly effective latent-space normalisation technique that boosts out-of-distribution performance by +5.42% mAP for convolutional and +3.75% mAP for transformer-based models. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis on the role of backgrounds in out-of-distribution behaviour recognition, including the so far unexplored impact of background durations (i.e., the count of background frames within foreground videos).</description>

      <title>MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>KeyFace: Expressive Audio-Driven Facial Animation for Long Sequences via KeyFrame Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current audio-driven facial animation methods achieve impressive results for short videos but suffer from error accumulation and identity drift when extended to longer durations. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this through external spatial control, increasing long-term consistency but compromising the naturalness of motion. We propose KeyFace, a novel two-stage diffusion-based framework, to address these issues. In the first stage, keyframes are generated at a low frame rate, conditioned on audio input and an identity frame, to capture essential facial expressions and movements over extended periods of time. In the second stage, an interpolation model fills in the gaps between keyframes, ensuring smooth transitions and temporal coherence. To further enhance realism, we incorporate continuous emotion representations and handle a wide range of non-speech vocalizations (NSVs), such as laughter and sighs. We also introduce two new evaluation metrics for assessing lip synchronization and NSV generation. Experimental results show that KeyFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, coherent facial animations over extended durations, successfully encompassing NSVs and continuous emotions.</description>

      <title>Speculative MoE: Communication Efficient Parallel MoE Inference with Speculative Token and Expert Pre-scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.</description>

      <title>Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</description>

      <title>Lightweight Software Kernels and Hardware Extensions for Efficient Sparse Deep Neural Networks on Microcontrollers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of pruned Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices such as Microcontrollers (MCUs) is a challenging task, given the tight area- and power-constraints of these devices. In this work, we propose a three-fold contribution to address this problem. First, we design a set of optimized software kernels for N:M pruned layers, targeting ultra-low-power, multicore RISC-V MCUs, which are up to 2.1x and 3.4x faster than their dense counterparts at 1:8 and 1:16 sparsity, respectively. Then, we implement a lightweight Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA) extension to accelerate the indirect load and non-zero indices decompression operations required by our kernels, obtaining up to 1.9x extra speedup, at the cost of a 5% area overhead. Lastly, we extend an open-source DNN compiler to utilize our sparse kernels for complete networks, showing speedups of 3.21x and 1.81x on a ResNet18 and a Vision Transformer (ViT), with less than 1.5% accuracy drop compared to a dense baseline.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Layer Attention Efficiency through Pruning Redundant Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</description>

      <title>SemHiTok: A Unified Image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Codebook for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete feature representations for multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves excellent rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing High-Quality Code Generation in Large Language Models with Comparative Prefix-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in commercial code completion engines, significantly enhancing coding efficiency and productivity. However, LLMs may generate code with quality issues that violate coding standards and best practices, such as poor code style and maintainability, even when the code is functionally correct. This necessitates additional effort from developers to improve the code, potentially negating the efficiency gains provided by LLMs. To address this problem, we propose a novel comparative prefix-tuning method for controllable high-quality code generation. Our method introduces a single, property-specific prefix that is prepended to the activations of the LLM, serving as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning. Unlike existing methods that require training multiple prefixes, our approach trains only one prefix and leverages pairs of high-quality and low-quality code samples, introducing a sequence-level ranking loss to guide the model's training. This comparative approach enables the model to better understand the differences between high-quality and low-quality code, focusing on aspects that impact code quality. Additionally, we design a data construction pipeline to collect and annotate pairs of high-quality and low-quality code, facilitating effective training. Extensive experiments on the Code Llama 7B model demonstrate that our method improves code quality by over 100% in certain task categories, while maintaining functional correctness. We also conduct ablation studies and generalization experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our method's components and its strong generalization capability.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-Inspired Exploration of RL-based LLMs and Synergy with Wireless Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</description>

      <title>dFLMoE: Decentralized Federated Learning via Mixture of Experts for Medical Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has wide applications in the medical field. It enables knowledge sharing among different healthcare institutes while protecting patients' privacy. However, existing federated learning systems are typically centralized, requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central server for aggregation. This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge from each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already undermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each client. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the central server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions or connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework, clients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After exchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as individual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to make collective decisions. This design not only reduces the knowledge damage with client-specific aggregations but also removes the dependency on the central server to enhance the robustness of the framework. We validate our framework on multiple medical tasks, demonstrating that our method evidently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both model homogeneity and heterogeneity settings.</description>

      <title>Introducing Verification Task of Set Consistency with Set-Consistency Energy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examining logical inconsistencies among multiple statements (such as collections of sentences or question-answer pairs) is a crucial challenge in machine learning, particularly for ensuring the safety and reliability of models. Traditional methods that rely on pairwise comparisons often fail to capture inconsistencies that only emerge when more than two statements are evaluated collectively. To address this gap, we introduce the task of set-consistency verification, an extension of natural language inference (NLI) that assesses the logical coherence of entire sets rather than isolated pairs. Building on this task, we present the Set-Consistency Energy Network (SC-Energy), a novel model that employs a contrastive loss framework to learn the compatibility among a collection of statements. Our approach not only efficiently verifies inconsistencies and pinpoints the specific statements responsible for logical contradictions, but also significantly outperforms existing methods including prompting-based LLM models. Furthermore, we release two new datasets: Set-LConVQA and Set-SNLI for set-consistency verification task.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for Automated Segmentation and Quantitative Measurement of Spinal Structures in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Accurate spinal structure measurement is crucial for assessing spine health and diagnosing conditions like spondylosis, disc herniation, and stenosis. Manual methods for measuring intervertebral disc height and spinal canal diameter are subjective and time-consuming. Automated solutions are needed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility in clinical practice.
  Purpose: This study develops an autonomous AI system for segmenting and measuring key spinal structures in MRI scans, focusing on intervertebral disc height and spinal canal anteroposterior (AP) diameter in the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic regions. The goal is to reduce clinician workload, enhance diagnostic consistency, and improve assessments.
  Methods: The AI model leverages deep learning architectures, including UNet, nnU-Net, and CNNs. Trained on a large proprietary MRI dataset, it was validated against expert annotations. Performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients and segmentation accuracy.
  Results: The AI model achieved Dice coefficients of 0.94 for lumbar, 0.91 for cervical, and 0.90 for dorsal spine segmentation (D1-D12). It precisely measured spinal parameters like disc height and canal diameter, demonstrating robustness and clinical applicability.
  Conclusion: The AI system effectively automates MRI-based spinal measurements, improving accuracy and reducing clinician workload. Its consistent performance across spinal regions supports clinical decision-making, particularly in high-demand settings, enhancing spinal assessments and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>DCAT: Dual Cross-Attention Fusion for Disease Classification in Radiological Images with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable image classification is crucial in radiology, where diagnostic decisions significantly impact patient outcomes. Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency. By combining multi-scale feature extraction, bidirectional attention and uncertainty estimation, our proposed model strongly impacts medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</description>

      <title>MAP: Multi-user Personalization with Collaborative LLM-powered Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-powered agents in multi-user settings underscores the need for reliable, usable methods to accommodate diverse preferences and resolve conflicting directives. Drawing on conflict resolution theory, we introduce a user-centered workflow for multi-user personalization comprising three stages: Reflection, Analysis, and Feedback. We then present MAP -- a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent system for multi-user \textbf{P}ersonalization -- to operationalize this workflow. By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems to implement user-centered, multi-user personalization workflows and concludes by offering insights for personalization in multi-user contexts.</description>

      <title>MMLNB: Multi-Modal Learning for Neuroblastoma Subtyping Classification Assisted with Textual Description Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NB), a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality, exhibits significant histopathological variability, necessitating precise subtyping for accurate prognosis and treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective evaluations that are time-consuming and inconsistent. To address these challenges, we introduce MMLNB, a multi-modal learning (MML) model that integrates pathological images with generated textual descriptions to improve classification accuracy and interpretability. The approach follows a two-stage process. First, we fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance pathology-aware text generation. Second, the fine-tuned VLM generates textual descriptions, using a dual-branch architecture to independently extract visual and textual features. These features are fused via Progressive Robust Multi-Modal Fusion (PRMF) Block for stable training. Experimental results show that the MMLNB model is more accurate than the single modal model. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of multi-modal fusion, fine-tuning, and the PRMF mechanism.

      <title>DLPO: Towards a Robust, Efficient, and Generalizable Prompt Optimization Framework from a Deep-Learning Perspective</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, largely driven by well-designed prompts. However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation. We hope our study not only provides valuable guidance for future research but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in prompt optimization.

      <title>Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</description>

      <title>From Autonomous Agents to Integrated Systems, A New Paradigm: Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of integrated systems that merge computational prowess with human decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI), a novel paradigm that reconceptualizes AI not as isolated autonomous agents, but as cohesive, orchestrated networks that work in tandem with human expertise. ODI leverages advanced orchestration layers, multi-loop feedback mechanisms, and a high cognitive density framework to transform static, record-keeping systems into dynamic, action-oriented environments. Through a comprehensive review of multi-agent system literature, recent technological advances, and practical insights from industry forums, we argue that the future of AI lies in integrating distributed intelligence within human-centric workflows. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency and strategic agility but also addresses challenges related to scalability, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Our work outlines key theoretical implications and presents a practical roadmap for future research and enterprise innovation, aiming to pave the way for responsible and adaptive AI systems that drive sustainable innovation in human organizations.</description>

      <title>Manual Labelling Artificially Inflates Deep Learning-Based Segmentation Performance on RGB Images of Closed Canopy: Validation Using TLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring forest dynamics at an individual tree scale is essential for accurately assessing ecosystem responses to climate change, yet traditional methods relying on field-based forest inventories are labor-intensive and limited in spatial coverage. Advances in remote sensing using drone-acquired RGB imagery combined with deep learning models have promised precise individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation; however, existing methods are frequently validated against human-annotated images, lacking rigorous independent ground truth. In this study, we generate high-fidelity validation labels from co-located Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data for drone imagery of mixed unmanaged boreal and Mediterranean forests. We evaluate the performance of two widely used deep learning ITC segmentation models - DeepForest (RetinaNet) and Detectree2 (Mask R-CNN) - on these data, and compare to performance on further Mediterranean forest data labelled manually. When validated against TLS-derived ground truth from Mediterranean forests, model performance decreased significantly compared to assessment based on hand-labelled from an ecologically similar site (AP50: 0.094 vs. 0.670). Restricting evaluation to only canopy trees shrank this gap considerably (Canopy AP50: 0.365), although performance was still far lower than on similar hand-labelled data. Models also performed poorly on boreal forest data (AP50: 0.142), although again increasing when evaluated on canopy trees only (Canopy AP50: 0.308). Both models showed very poor localisation accuracy at stricter IoU thresholds, even when restricted to canopy trees (Max AP75: 0.051). Similar results have been observed in studies using aerial LiDAR data, suggesting fundamental limitations in aerial-based segmentation approaches in closed canopy forests.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science simulations.</description>

      <title>MoonCast: High-Quality Zero-Shot Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However, these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long, multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous, oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories, technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in spontaneity and coherence.</description>

      <title>State Space Model Meets Transformer: A New Paradigm for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP50 on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets. Based on the VDETR baseline, Our method sets a new SOTA on the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.</description>
