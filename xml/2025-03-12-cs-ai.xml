      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Fuzzy Implication Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy implication functions are a key area of study in fuzzy logic, extending the classical logical conditional to handle truth degrees in the interval $[0,1]$. While existing literature often focuses on a limited number of families, in the last ten years many new families have been introduced, each defined by specific construction methods and having different key properties. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of the diverse families of fuzzy implication functions, emphasizing their motivations, properties, and potential applications. By organizing the information schematically, this document serves as a valuable resource for both theoretical researchers seeking to avoid redundancy and practitioners looking to select appropriate operators for specific applications.</description>

      <title>DriveGen: Towards Infinite Diverse Traffic Scenarios with Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving training and testing. Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Market-based Architectures in RL and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market-based agents refer to reinforcement learning agents which determine their actions based on an internal market of sub-agents. We introduce a new type of market-based algorithm where the state itself is factored into several axes called ``goods'', which allows for greater specialization and parallelism than existing market-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, we argue that market-based algorithms have the potential to address many current challenges in AI, such as search, dynamic scaling and complete feedback, and demonstrate that they may be seen to generalize neural networks; finally, we list some novel ways that market algorithms may be applied in conjunction with Large Language Models for immediate practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like cognition and decision making in the light of quantum measurement theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the class of quantum measurements that matches the applications of quantum theory to cognition (and decision making) - quantum-like modeling. Projective measurements describe the canonical measurements of the basic observables of quantum physics. However, the combinations of the basic cognitive effects, such as the question order and response replicability effects, cannot be described by projective measurements. We motivate the use of the special class of quantum measurements, namely {\it sharp repeatable non-projective measurements} - ${\cal SR\bar{P}}. $ This class is practically unused in quantum physics. Thus, physics and cognition explore different parts of quantum measurement theory. Quantum-like modeling isn't automatic borrowing of the quantum formalism. Exploring the class ${\cal SR\bar{P}}$ highlights the role of {\it noncommutativity of the state update maps generated by measurement back action.} Thus, ``non-classicality'' in quantum physics as well as quantum-like modeling for cognition is based on two different types of noncommutativity, of operators (observables) and instruments (state update maps): {\it observable-noncommutativity} vs. {\it state update-noncommutativity}. We speculate that distinguishing quantum-like properties of the cognitive effects are the expressions of the latter, or possibly both.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reasoning with Collaboration and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We envision a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together to solve reasoning problems, drawing on memory they collectively build to improve performance as they gain experience. This work establishes the foundations for such a system by studying the interoperability of chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration, and memory banks. Extending beyond the identical agents of self-consistency, we introduce varied-context agents with diverse exemplars and a summarizer agent in place of voting. We generate frozen and continuously learned memory banks of exemplars and pair them with fixed, random, and similarity-based retrieval mechanisms. Our systematic study reveals where various methods contribute to reasoning performance of two LLMs on three grounded reasoning tasks, showing that random exemplar selection can often beat more principled approaches, and in some tasks, inclusion of any exemplars serves only to distract both weak and strong models.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Graph Traversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research considers Bayesian decision-analytic approaches toward the traversal of an uncertain graph. Namely, a traveler progresses over a graph in which rewards are gained upon a node's first visit and costs are incurred for every edge traversal. The traveler knows the graph's adjacency matrix and his starting position but does not know the rewards and costs. The traveler is a Bayesian who encodes his beliefs about these values using a Gaussian process prior and who seeks to maximize his expected utility over these beliefs. Adopting a decision-analytic perspective, we develop sequential decision-making solution strategies for this coupled information-collection and network-routing problem. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and derive properties of the optimal walk. These properties provide heuristics for the traveler's problem that balance exploration and exploitation. We provide a practical case study focused on the use of unmanned aerial systems for public safety and empirically study policy performance in myriad Erdos-Renyi settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has led to an increasing deployment of AI models on edge and terminal devices, driven by the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the need for real-time data processing. This survey comprehensively explores the current state, technical challenges, and future trends of on-device AI models. We define on-device AI models as those designed to perform local data processing and inference, emphasizing their characteristics such as real-time performance, resource constraints, and enhanced data privacy. The survey is structured around key themes, including the fundamental concepts of AI models, application scenarios across various domains, and the technical challenges faced in edge environments. We also discuss optimization and implementation strategies, such as data preprocessing, model compression, and hardware acceleration, which are essential for effective deployment. Furthermore, we examine the impact of emerging technologies, including edge computing and foundation models, on the evolution of on-device AI models. By providing a structured overview of the challenges, solutions, and future directions, this survey aims to facilitate further research and application of on-device AI, ultimately contributing to the advancement of intelligent systems in everyday life.</description>

      <title>DSGBench: A Diverse Strategic Game Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Agents in Complex Decision-Making Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model~(LLM) based agents have been increasingly popular in solving complex and dynamic tasks, which requires proper evaluation systems to assess their capabilities. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks usually either focus on single-objective tasks or use overly broad assessing metrics, failing to provide a comprehensive inspection of the actual capabilities of LLM-based agents in complicated decision-making tasks. To address these issues, we introduce DSGBench, a more rigorous evaluation platform for strategic decision-making. Firstly, it incorporates six complex strategic games which serve as ideal testbeds due to their long-term and multi-dimensional decision-making demands and flexibility in customizing tasks of various difficulty levels or multiple targets. Secondly, DSGBench employs a fine-grained evaluation scoring system which examines the decision-making capabilities by looking into the performance in five specific dimensions and offering a comprehensive assessment in a well-designed way. Furthermore, DSGBench also incorporates an automated decision-tracking mechanism which enables in-depth analysis of agent behaviour patterns and the changes in their strategies. We demonstrate the advances of DSGBench by applying it to multiple popular LLM-based agents and our results suggest that DSGBench provides valuable insights in choosing LLM-based agents as well as improving their future development. DSGBench is available at https://github.com/DeciBrain-Group/DSGBench.</description>

      <title>MANDARIN: Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Dynamic Delirium and Coma Prediction in ICU Patients: Development and Validation of an Acute Brain Dysfunction Prediction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute brain dysfunction (ABD) is a common, severe ICU complication, presenting as delirium or coma and leading to prolonged stays, increased mortality, and cognitive decline. Traditional screening tools like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) rely on intermittent assessments, causing delays and inconsistencies. In this study, we propose MANDARIN (Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Dynamic Delirium and Coma Prediction in ICU Patients), a 1.5M-parameter mixture-of-experts neural network to predict ABD in real-time among ICU patients. The model integrates temporal and static data from the ICU to predict the brain status in the next 12 to 72 hours, using a multi-branch approach to account for current brain status. The MANDARIN model was trained on data from 92,734 patients (132,997 ICU admissions) from 2 hospitals between 2008-2019 and validated externally on data from 11,719 patients (14,519 ICU admissions) from 15 hospitals and prospectively on data from 304 patients (503 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2021-2024. Three datasets were used: the University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. MANDARIN significantly outperforms the baseline neurological assessment scores (GCS, CAM, and RASS) for delirium prediction in both external (AUROC 75.5% CI: 74.2%-76.8% vs 68.3% CI: 66.9%-69.5%) and prospective (AUROC 82.0% CI: 74.8%-89.2% vs 72.7% CI: 65.5%-81.0%) cohorts, as well as for coma prediction (external AUROC 87.3% CI: 85.9%-89.0% vs 72.8% CI: 70.6%-74.9%, and prospective AUROC 93.4% CI: 88.5%-97.9% vs 67.7% CI: 57.7%-76.8%) with a 12-hour lead time. This tool has the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making by continuously monitoring the brain status of patients in the ICU.</description>

      <title>System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>VACT: A Video Automatic Causal Testing System and a Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-conditioned Video Generation Models (VGMs), the quality of generated videos has significantly improved, bringing these models closer to functioning as ``*world simulators*'' and making real-world-level video generation more accessible and cost-effective. However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</description>

      <title>Breaking Free from MMI: A New Frontier in Rationalization by Probing Input Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input is a key problem in explainability research. The most widely used fundamental criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. In this paper, we first demonstrate that MMI suffers from diminishing marginal returns. Once part of the rationale has been identified, finding the remaining portions contributes only marginally to increasing the mutual information, making it difficult to use MMI to locate the rest. In contrast to MMI that aims to reproduce the prediction, we seek to identify the parts of the input that the network can actually utilize.
  This is achieved by comparing how different rationale candidates match the capability space of the weight matrix. The weight matrix of a neural network is typically low-rank, meaning that the linear combinations of its column vectors can only cover part of the directions in a high-dimensional space (high-dimension: the dimensions of an input vector). If an input is fully utilized by the network, {it generally matches these directions (e.g., a portion of a hypersphere), resulting in a representation with a high norm. Conversely, if an input primarily falls outside (orthogonal to) these directions}, its representation norm will approach zero, behaving like noise that the network cannot effectively utilize. Building on this, we propose using the norms of rationale candidates as an alternative objective to MMI. Through experiments on four text classification datasets and one graph classification dataset using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method outperforms MMI and its improved variants in identifying better rationales. We also compare our method with a representative LLM (llama-3.1-8b-instruct) and find that our simple method gets comparable results to it and can sometimes even outperform it.</description>

      <title>LapSum -- One Method to Differentiate Them All: Ranking, Sorting and Top-k Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for constructing differentiable order-type operations, including soft ranking, soft top-k selection, and soft permutations. Our approach leverages an efficient closed-form formula for the inverse of the function LapSum, defined as the sum of Laplace distributions. This formulation ensures low computational and memory complexity in selecting the highest activations, enabling losses and gradients to be computed in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for high-dimensional vectors and large $k$ values. Furthermore, we provide efficient implementations for both CPU and CUDA environments, underscoring the practicality and scalability of our method for large-scale ranking and differentiable ordering problems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Belief in Incomplete Information MAIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) are probabilistic graphical models which represent strategic interactions between agents. MAIDs are equivalent to extensive form games (EFGs) but have a more compact and informative structure. However, MAIDs cannot, in general, represent settings of incomplete information -- wherein agents have different beliefs about the game being played, and different beliefs about each-other's beliefs. In this paper, we introduce incomplete information MAIDs (II-MAIDs). We define both infinite and finite-depth II-MAIDs and prove an equivalence relation to EFGs with incomplete information and no common prior over types. We prove that II-MAIDs inherit classical equilibria concepts via this equivalence, but note that these solution concepts are often unrealistic in the setting with no common prior because they violate common knowledge of rationality. We define a more realistic solution concept based on recursive best-response. Throughout, we describe an example with a hypothetical AI agent undergoing evaluation to illustrate the applicability of II-MAIDs.</description>

      <title>General Scales Unlock AI Evaluation with Explanatory and Predictive Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective use of AI requires understanding and anticipating its performance on novel tasks, from advanced scientific challenges to transformed workplace activities. So far, benchmarking has guided progress in AI, but it has offered limited explanatory and predictive power for general-purpose AI systems, given the low transferability across diverse tasks. In this paper, we introduce general scales for AI evaluation that can explain what common AI benchmarks really measure, extract ability profiles of AI systems, and predict their performance for new task instances, in- and out-of-distribution. Our fully-automated methodology builds on 18 newly-crafted rubrics that place instance demands on general scales that do not saturate. Illustrated for 15 large language models and 63 tasks, high explanatory power is unleashed from inspecting the demand and ability profiles, bringing insights on the sensitivity and specificity exhibited by different benchmarks, and how knowledge, metacognition and reasoning are affected by model size, chain-of-thought and distillation. Surprisingly, high predictive power at the instance level becomes possible using these demand levels, providing superior estimates over black-box baseline predictors based on embeddings or finetuning, especially in out-of-distribution settings (new tasks and new benchmarks). The scales, rubrics, battery, techniques and results presented here represent a major step for AI evaluation, underpinning the reliable deployment of AI in the years ahead.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery and Inference towards Urban Elements and Associated Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To uncover the city's fundamental functioning mechanisms, it is important to acquire a deep understanding of complicated relationships among citizens, location, and mobility behaviors. Previous research studies have applied direct correlation analysis to investigate such relationships. Nevertheless, due to the ubiquitous confounding effects, empirical correlation analysis may not accurately reflect underlying causal relationships among basic urban elements. In this paper, we propose a novel urban causal computing framework to comprehensively explore causalities and confounding effects among a variety of factors across different types of urban elements. In particular, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to discover the potential causal graph, which depicts the causal relations between urban factors. The causal graph further serves as the guidance for estimating causal effects between pair-wise urban factors by propensity score matching. After removing the confounding effects from correlations, we leverage significance levels of causal effects in downstream urban mobility prediction tasks. Experimental studies on open-source urban datasets show that the discovered causal graph demonstrates a hierarchical structure, where citizens affect locations, and they both cause changes in urban mobility behaviors. Experimental results in urban mobility prediction tasks further show that the proposed method can effectively reduce confounding effects and enhance performance of urban computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Minimum Vertex Cover Solving via a GCN-assisted Heuristic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding a minimum vertex cover (MVC) in a graph is a well-known NP-hard problem with significant practical applications in optimization and scheduling. Its complexity, combined with the increasing scale of problems, underscores the need for efficient and effective algorithms. However, existing heuristic algorithms for MVC often rely on simplistic initialization strategies and overlook the impact of edge attributes and neighborhood information on vertex selection. In this paper, we introduce GCNIVC, a novel heuristic search algorithm designed to address the limitations of existing methods for solving MVC problems in large-scale graphs. Our approach features two main innovations. First, it utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture the global structure of graphs, which enables the generation of high-quality initial solutions that enhance the efficiency of the subsequent search process. Second, GCNIVC introduces a new heuristic that employs three containers and the concept of double-covered edges (dc-edges), improving search efficiency and providing greater flexibility for adding and removing operations based on edge attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GCNIVC outperforms state-of-the-art MVC algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GCNIVC's GCN-assisted initialization and its edge-informed search strategy. This study not only advances the understanding of MVC problem-solving but also contributes a new tool for addressing large-scale graph optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Performant LLM Agentic Framework for Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Agentic applications and automation in the Voice AI industry has led to an increased reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) to navigate graph-based logic workflows composed of nodes and edges. However, existing methods face challenges such as alignment errors in complex workflows and hallucinations caused by excessive context size. To address these limitations, we introduce the Performant Agentic Framework (PAF), a novel system that assists LLMs in selecting appropriate nodes and executing actions in order when traversing complex graphs. PAF combines LLM-based reasoning with a mathematically grounded vector scoring mechanism, achieving both higher accuracy and reduced latency. Our approach dynamically balances strict adherence to predefined paths with flexible node jumps to handle various user inputs efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that PAF significantly outperforms baseline methods, paving the way for scalable, real-time Conversational AI systems in complex business environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI Negotiations: New Theory and Evidence from a Large-Scale Autonomous Negotiations Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation agents, there has been limited integration of computer science research and established negotiation theory to develop new theories of AI negotiation. To bridge this gap, we conducted an International AI Negotiations Competition in which participants iteratively designed and refined prompts for large language model (LLM) negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 120,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that fundamental principles from established human-human negotiation theory remain crucial in AI-AI negotiations. Specifically, agents exhibiting high warmth fostered higher counterpart subjective value and reached deals more frequently, which enabled them to create and claim more value in integrative settings. However, conditional on reaching a deal, warm agents claimed less value while dominant agents claimed more value. These results align with classic negotiation theory emphasizing relationship-building, assertiveness, and preparation. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by negotiation theory, particularly regarding the effectiveness of AI-specific strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. The agent that won our competition implemented an approach that blended traditional negotiation preparation frameworks with AI-specific methods. Together, these results suggest the importance of establishing a new theory of AI negotiations that integrates established negotiation theory with AI-specific strategies to optimize agent performance. Our research suggests this new theory must account for the unique characteristics of autonomous agents and establish the conditions under which traditional negotiation theory applies in automated settings.</description>

      <title>Explaining Control Policies through Predicate Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical controllers of complex systems are hard to construct manually. Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.</description>

      <title>Think Twice, Click Once: Enhancing GUI Grounding via Fast and Slow Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can flexibly switch between different modes of thinking based on task complexity: from rapid intuitive judgments to in-depth analytical understanding. However, current Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding systems which locate interface elements based on natural language instructions rely solely on immediate prediction without reasoning, struggling to understand complex interface layouts with nested structures and hierarchical relationships, limiting their effectiveness on complex interfaces. Inspired by human dual-system cognition, we present Focus, a novel GUI grounding framework that combines fast prediction with systematic analysis. The framework dynamically switches between rapid and deliberate processing through an adaptive system switching based on task complexity, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. Focus decomposes grounding into progressive stages: interface summarization, visual focused analysis, and precise coordinate prediction. This structured decomposition enables systematic understanding of both interface layouts and visual relationships. Extensive experiments show that Focus achieves state-of-the-art performance using only 300K of the training data with a 2B parameter model compared to existing approaches. Focus demonstrates superior performance particularly in complex GUI scenarios, achieving 77.4% average accuracy on ScreenSpot and 13.3% on the more challenging ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals the effectiveness of this dual-system approach while demonstrating its potential for improving complex GUI interaction scenarios.</description>

      <title>SKG-LLM: Developing a Mathematical Model for Stroke Knowledge Graph Construction Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to introduce SKG-LLM. A knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from stroke-related articles using mathematical and large language models (LLMs). SKG-LLM extracts and organizes complex relationships from the biomedical literature, using it to increase the accuracy and depth of KG in stroke research. In the proposed method, GPT-4 was used for data pre-processing, and the extraction of embeddings was also done by GPT-4 in the whole KG construction process. The performance of the proposed model was tested with two evaluation criteria: Precision and Recall. For further validation of the proposed model, GPT-4 was used. Compared with Wikidata and WN18RR, the proposed KG-LLM approach performs better, especially in precision and recall. By including GPT-4 in the preprocessing process, the SKG-LLM model achieved a precision score of 0.906 and a recall score of 0.923. Expert reviews further improved the results and increased precision to 0.923 and recall to 0.918. The knowledge graph constructed by SKG-LLM contains 2692 nodes and 5012 edges, which are 13 distinct types of nodes and 24 types of edges.</description>

      <title>ExKG-LLM: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Expansion of Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces ExKG-LLM, a framework designed to automate the expansion of cognitive neuroscience knowledge graphs (CNKG) using large language models (LLMs). It addresses limitations in existing tools by enhancing accuracy, completeness, and usefulness in CNKG. The framework leverages a large dataset of scientific papers and clinical reports, applying state-of-the-art LLMs to extract, optimize, and integrate new entities and relationships. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, and graph density. Results show significant improvements: precision (0.80, +6.67%), recall (0.81, +15.71%), F1 score (0.805, +11.81%), and increased edge nodes (21.13% and 31.92%). Graph density slightly decreased, reflecting a broader but more fragmented structure. Engagement rates rose by 20%, while CNKG diameter increased to 15, indicating a more distributed structure. Time complexity improved to O(n log n), but space complexity rose to O(n2), indicating higher memory usage. ExKG-LLM demonstrates potential for enhancing knowledge generation, semantic search, and clinical decision-making in cognitive neuroscience, adaptable to broader scientific fields.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarr\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.</description>

      <title>ProJudge: A Multi-Modal Multi-Discipline Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset for MLLM-based Process Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors when solving scientific problems, evaluating the validity of their reasoning processes is critical for ensuring reliability and uncovering fine-grained model weaknesses. Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice. However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain. To address this, we introduce ProJudgeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges. ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors. Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we further propose ProJudge-173k, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a Dynamic Dual-Phase fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models. All the resources will be released to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation.</description>

      <title>Agent models: Internalizing Chain-of-Action Generation into Reasoning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position \emph{Large Agent Models (LAMs)} that internalize the generation of \emph{Chain-of-Action (CoA)}, enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions.

      <title>Beyond Black-Box Benchmarking: Observability, Analytics, and Optimization of Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional "black box" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Dubito Ergo Sum: Exploring AI Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We paraphrase Descartes' famous dictum in the area of AI ethics where the "I doubt and therefore I am" is suggested as a necessary aspect of morality. Therefore AI, which cannot doubt itself, cannot possess moral agency. Of course, this is not the end of the story. We explore various aspects of the human mind that substantially differ from AI, which includes the sensory grounding of our knowing, the act of understanding, and the significance of being able to doubt ourselves. The foundation of our argument is the discipline of ethics, one of the oldest and largest knowledge projects of human history, yet, we seem only to be beginning to get a grasp of it. After a couple of thousand years of studying the ethics of humans, we (humans) arrived at a point where moral psychology suggests that our moral decisions are intuitive, and all the models from ethics become relevant only when we explain ourselves. This recognition has a major impact on what and how we can do regarding AI ethics. We do not offer a solution, we explore some ideas and leave the problem open, but we hope somewhat better understood than before our study.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Logic-Inspired Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in many applications. Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</description>

      <title>ReAgent: Reversible Multi-Agent Reasoning for Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Hop QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-hop question answering (QA) through direct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.</description>

      <title>Rule-Based Conflict-Free Decision Framework in Swarm Confrontation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional rule--based decision--making methods with interpretable advantage, such as finite state machine, suffer from the jitter or deadlock(JoD) problems in extremely dynamic scenarios. To realize agent swarm confrontation, decision conflicts causing many JoD problems are a key issue to be solved. Here, we propose a novel decision--making framework that integrates probabilistic finite state machine, deep convolutional networks, and reinforcement learning to implement interpretable intelligence into agents. Our framework overcomes state machine instability and JoD problems, ensuring reliable and adaptable decisions in swarm confrontation. The proposed approach demonstrates effective performance via enhanced human--like cooperation and competitive strategies in the rigorous evaluation of real experiments, outperforming other methods.</description>

      <title>Correctness Learning: Deductive Verification Guided Learning for Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in AI and decision-making technologies in safety-critical fields, challenges remain in verifying the correctness of decision output schemes and verification-result driven design. We propose correctness learning (CL) to enhance human-AI collaboration integrating deductive verification methods and insights from historical high-quality schemes. The typical pattern hidden in historical high-quality schemes, such as change of task priorities in shared resources, provides critical guidance for intelligent agents in learning and decision-making. By utilizing deductive verification methods, we proposed patten-driven correctness learning (PDCL), formally modeling and reasoning the adaptive behaviors-or 'correctness pattern'-of system agents based on historical high-quality schemes, capturing the logical relationships embedded within these schemes. Using this logical information as guidance, we establish a correctness judgment and feedback mechanism to steer the intelligent decision model toward the 'correctness pattern' reflected in historical high-quality schemes. Extensive experiments across multiple working conditions and core parameters validate the framework's components and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving decision-making and resource optimization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Transportation Planning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.</description>

      <title>Lawful and Accountable Personal Data Processing with GDPR-based Access and Usage Control in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance with the GDPR privacy regulation places a significant burden on organisations regarding the handling of personal data. The perceived efforts and risks of complying with the GDPR further increase when data processing activities span across organisational boundaries, as is the case in both small-scale data sharing settings and in large-scale international data spaces.
  This paper addresses these concerns by proposing a case-generic method for automated normative reasoning that establishes legal arguments for the lawfulness of data processing activities. The arguments are established on the basis of case-specific legal qualifications made by privacy experts, bringing the human in the loop. The obtained expert system promotes transparency and accountability, remains adaptable to extended or altered interpretations of the GDPR, and integrates into novel or existing distributed data processing systems.
  This result is achieved by defining a formal ontology and semantics for automated normative reasoning based on an analysis of the purpose-limitation principle of the GDPR. The ontology and semantics are implemented in eFLINT, a domain-specific language for specifying and reasoning with norms. The XACML architecture standard, applicable to both access and usage control, is extended, demonstrating how GDPR-based normative reasoning can integrate into (existing, distributed) systems for data processing. The resulting system is designed and critically assessed in reference to requirements extracted from the GPDR.</description>

      <title>A Zero-shot Learning Method Based on Large Language Models for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingual transfer. Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations or entities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and practicality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectively transferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we propose ZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using large language models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseen categories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling semantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories. Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen categories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Automatic Curriculum Design for Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate with humans without using human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen environments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should consider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination ability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these challenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in competitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends the multi-agent UED approach to a zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a utility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination setting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more effectively than the previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI coordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using human proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline models and achieves a high human-AI coordination performance in unseen environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to robot-assisted rehabilitation lies in the design of the human-machine interface, which must accommodate the needs of both patients and machines. Current interface designs primarily focus on machine control algorithms, often requiring patients to spend considerable time adapting. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the Cooperative Adaptive Markov Decision Process (CAMDPs) model to address the fundamental aspects of the interactive learning process, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance. We establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of CAMDPs and ensure the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium points. Leveraging these conditions, we guarantee the system's convergence to a unique Nash equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore scenarios with multiple Nash equilibrium points, devising strategies to adjust both Value Evaluation and Policy Improvement algorithms to enhance the likelihood of converging to the global minimal Nash equilibrium point. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions and algorithms, demonstrating their applicability and robustness in practical settings. The proposed conditions for convergence and the identification of a unique optimal Nash equilibrium contribute to the development of more effective adaptive systems for human users in robot-assisted rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Encoding Argumentation Frameworks to Propositional Logic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) has been a useful tool for artificial intelligence. The research of the connection between $AF$s and logic is an important branch. This paper generalizes the encoding method by encoding $AF$s as logical formulas in different propositional logic systems. It studies the relationship between models of an AF by argumentation semantics, including Dung's classical semantics and Gabbay's equational semantics, and models of the encoded formulas by semantics of propositional logic systems. Firstly, we supplement the proof of the regular encoding function in the case of encoding $AF$s to the 2-valued propositional logic system. Then we encode $AF$s to 3-valued propositional logic systems and fuzzy propositional logic systems and explore the model relationship. This paper enhances the connection between $AF$s and propositional logic systems. It also provides a new way to construct new equational semantics by choosing different fuzzy logic operations.</description>

      <title>From Text to Visuals: Using LLMs to Generate Math Diagrams with Vector Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for enhancing math education by automating support for both teachers and students. While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored. Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students and teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance problem-solving and learning experiences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of transformer architecture was a turning point in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Models based on the transformer architecture such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) have gained widespread popularity in various applications such as software development and education. The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard to the general public has showcased the tremendous potential of these models and encouraged their integration into various domains such as software development for tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation generation. In this study, opinions from 11 experts regarding their experience with LLMs for software development have been gathered and analysed to draw insights that can guide successful and responsible integration. The overall opinion of the experts is positive, with the experts identifying advantages such as increase in productivity and reduced coding time. Potential concerns and challenges such as risk of over-dependence and ethical considerations have also been highlighted.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Knowledge Sharing for Enhanced Collaboration and Decision-Making in Non-Profit Healthcare Organizations: A Scoping Review Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This protocol outlines a scoping review designed to systematically map the existing body of evidence on AI-enabled knowledge sharing in resource-limited non-profit healthcare organizations. The review aims to investigate how such technologies enhance collaboration and decision-making, particularly in the context of reduced external support following the cessation of USAID operations. Guided by three theoretical frameworks namely, the Resource-Based View, Dynamic Capabilities Theory, and Absorptive Capacity Theory, this study will explore the dual role of AI as a strategic resource and an enabler of organizational learning and agility. The protocol details a rigorous methodological approach based on PRISMA-ScR guidelines, encompassing a systematic search strategy across multiple databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a structured data extraction process. By integrating theoretical insights with empirical evidence, this scoping review seeks to identify critical gaps in the literature and inform the design of effective, resource-optimized AI solutions in non-profit healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Queueing, Predictions, and LLMs: Challenges and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Queueing systems present many opportunities for applying machine-learning predictions, such as estimated service times, to improve system performance. This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large Language Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems.</description>

      <title>A Representationalist, Functionalist and Naturalistic Conception of Intelligence as a Foundation for AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the ability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously unknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such as deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as abstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are applied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are obtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but only correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and contingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is functionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the desired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by attributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This representational and functional conception of intelligence enables a naturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as intentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of intelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can gain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited by the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum phase transitions through Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09555v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a computational pipeline based on a recent machine learning technique, namely the Topological Data Analysis (TDA), that has the capability of extracting powerful information-carrying topological features. We apply such a method to the study quantum phase transitions and, to showcase its validity and potential, we exploit such a method for the investigation of two paramount important quantum systems: the 2D periodic Anderson model and the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, both cases on the half-filling. To this end, we have performed unbiased auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, feeding the TDA with snapshots of the Hubbard-Stratonovich fields through the course of the simulations The quantum critical points obtained from TDA agree quantitatively well with the existing literature, therefore suggesting that this technique could be used to investigate quantum systems where the analysis of the phase transitions is still a challenge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11099v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a technique combining the accuracy of quantum Monte Carlo in describing the electron correlation with the efficiency of a Machine Learning Potential (MLP). We use kernel regression in combination with SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position) features, implemented here in a very efficient way. The key ingredients are: i) a sparsification technique, based on farthest point sampling, ensuring generality and transferability of our MLPs and ii) the so called $\Delta$-learning, allowing a small training data set, a fundamental property for highly accurate but computationally demanding calculations, such as the ones based on quantum Monte Carlo. As the first application we present a benchmark study of the liquid-liquid transition of high-pressure hydrogen and show the quality of our MLP, by emphasizing the importance of high accuracy for this very debated subject, where experiments are difficult in the lab, and theory is still far from being conclusive.</description>

      <title>ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.</description>

      <title>What I cannot execute, I do not understand: Training and Evaluating LLMs on Program Execution Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code generation and understanding are critical capabilities for large language models (LLMs). Thus, most LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on code data. However, these datasets typically treat code as static strings and rarely exploit the dynamic information about their execution. Building upon previous work on trace modeling, we study Execution Tuning (E.T.), a training procedure in which we explicitly model real-world program execution traces without requiring manual test annotations. We train and evaluate models on different execution trace granularities (line and instruction-level) and strategies on the task of output prediction, obtaining around 80% accuracy on CruxEval and MBPP, and showing the advantages of dynamic scratchpads (i.e., self-contained intermediate computations updated by the model rather than accumulated as a history of past computations) on long executions (up to 14k steps). Finally, we discuss E.T.'s practical applications.</description>

      <title>Inference Scaling Reshapes AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift from scaling up the pre-training compute of AI systems to scaling up their inference compute may have profound effects on AI governance. The nature of these effects depends crucially on whether this new inference compute will primarily be used during external deployment or as part of a more complex training programme within the lab. Rapid scaling of inference-at-deployment would: lower the importance of open-weight models (and of securing the weights of closed models), reduce the impact of the first human-level models, change the business model for frontier AI, reduce the need for power-intense data centres, and derail the current paradigm of AI governance via training compute thresholds. Rapid scaling of inference-during-training would have more ambiguous effects that range from a revitalisation of pre-training scaling to a form of recursive self-improvement via iterated distillation and amplification.</description>

      <title>Labeling Synthetic Content: User Perceptions of Warning Label Designs for AI-generated Content on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1. Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2. Trust in the labels and 3. Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the users belief that the content is AI generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as like, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human computer interaction by defining a design space for label implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of labels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly used in scientific research, but evaluating AI-generated scientific work remains challenging. While expert reviews are costly, large language models (LLMs) as proxy reviewers have proven to be unreliable. To address this, we investigate two automatic evaluation metrics, specifically citation count prediction and review score prediction. We parse all papers of OpenReview and augment each submission with its citation count, reference, and research hypothesis. Our findings reveal that citation count prediction is more viable than review score prediction, and predicting scores is more difficult purely from the research hypothesis than from the full paper. Furthermore, we show that a simple prediction model based solely on title and abstract outperforms LLM-based reviewers, though it still falls short of human-level consistency.</description>

      <title>The Butterfly Effect of Technology: How Various Factors accelerate or hinder the Arrival of Technological Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the concept of technological singularity and the factors that could accelerate or hinder its arrival. The butterfly effect is used as a framework to understand how seemingly small changes in complex systems can have significant and unpredictable outcomes. In section II, we discuss the various factors that could hasten the arrival of technological singularity, such as advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, breakthroughs in quantum computing, progress in brain-computer interfaces and human augmentation, and development of nanotechnology and 3D printing. In section III, we examine the factors that could delay or impede the arrival of technological singularity, including technical limitations and setbacks in AI and machine learning, ethical and societal concerns around AI and its impact on jobs and privacy, lack of sufficient investment in research and development, and regulatory barriers and political instability. Section IV explores the interplay of these factors and how they can impact the butterfly effect. Finally, in the conclusion, we summarize the key points discussed and emphasize the importance of considering the butterfly effect in predicting the future of technology. We call for continued research and investment in technology to shape its future and mitigate potential risks.</description>

      <title>AI Mimicry and Human Dignity: Chatbot Use as a Violation of Self-Respect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how human interactions with AI-powered chatbots may offend human dignity. Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs), mimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities essential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to anthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed to elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots often resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing on a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting with chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show that, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of second-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey second-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given the lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to subtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound to show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual chatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and companionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in such interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to human dignity.</description>

      <title>Addressing Moral Uncertainty using Large Language Models for Ethical Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ethical decision-making framework that refines a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) model using a task-agnostic ethical layer. Following initial training, the RL model undergoes ethical fine-tuning, where human feedback is replaced by feedback generated from a large language model (LLM). The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social justice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to recommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates belief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores that also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that align with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework helps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and enables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach, tested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation techniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced reliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in dynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it well-suited for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Political Neutrality in AI is Impossible- But Here is How to Approximate it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems often exhibit political bias, influencing users' opinions and decision-making. While political neutrality-defined as the absence of bias-is often seen as an ideal solution for fairness and safety, this position paper argues that true political neutrality is neither feasible nor universally desirable due to its subjective nature and the biases inherent in AI training data, algorithms, and user interactions. However, inspired by Joseph Raz's philosophical insight that "neutrality [...] can be a matter of degree" (Raz, 1986), we argue that striving for some neutrality remains essential for promoting balanced AI interactions and mitigating user manipulation. Therefore, we use the term "approximation" of political neutrality to shift the focus from unattainable absolutes to achievable, practical proxies. We propose eight techniques for approximating neutrality across three levels of conceptualizing AI, examining their trade-offs and implementation strategies. In addition, we explore two concrete applications of these approximations to illustrate their practicality. Finally, we assess our framework on current large language models (LLMs) at the output level, providing a demonstration of how it can be evaluated. This work seeks to advance nuanced discussions of political neutrality in AI and promote the development of responsible, aligned language models.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization with Diffusion Models for Green Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>AILuminate: Introducing v1.0 of the AI Risk and Reliability Benchmark from MLCommons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories, including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property, privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial, health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system, and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based system-response evaluation.
  In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally, including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions. This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to promote safer AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Design an Ontology for Cognitive Business Strategy Based on Customer Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontology is a general term used by researchers who want to share information in a specific domain. One of the hallmarks of the greatest success of a powerful manager of an organization is his ability to interpret unplanned and unrelated events. Tools to solve this problem are vital to business growth. Modern technology allows customers to be more informed and influential in their roles as patrons and critics. This can make or break a business. Research shows that businesses that employ a customer-first strategy and prioritize their customers can generate more revenue. Even though there are many different Ontologies offered to businesses, none of it is built from a cognitive perspective. The objective of this study is to address the concept of strategic business plans with a cognitive ontology approach as a basis for a new management tool. This research proposes to design a cognitive ontology model that links customer measurement with traditional business models, define relationships between components and verify the accuracy of the added financial value.</description>

      <title>Modeling Behavior Change for Multi-model At-Risk Students Early Prediction (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the educational domain, identifying students at risk of dropping out is essential for allowing educators to intervene effectively, improving both academic outcomes and overall student well-being. Data in educational settings often originate from diverse sources, such as assignments, grades, and attendance records. However, most existing research relies on online learning data and just extracting the quantitative features. While quantification eases processing, it also leads to a significant loss of original information. Moreover, current models primarily identify students with consistently poor performance through simple and discrete behavioural patterns, failing to capture the complex continuity and non-linear changes in student behaviour. We have developed an innovative prediction model, Multimodal- ChangePoint Detection (MCPD), utilizing the textual teacher remark data and numerical grade data from middle schools. Our model achieves a highly integrated and intelligent analysis by using independent encoders to process two data types, fusing the encoded feature. The model further refines its analysis by leveraging a changepoint detection module to pinpoint crucial behavioral changes, which are integrated as dynamic weights through a simple attention mechanism. Experimental validations indicate that our model achieves an accuracy range of 70- 75%, with an average outperforming baseline algorithms by approximately 5-10%. Additionally, our algorithm demonstrates a certain degree of transferability, maintaining high accuracy when adjusted and retrained with different definitions of at-risk, proving its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Local Differences, Global Lessons: Insights from Organisation Policies for International Legislation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI across diverse domains has led to the development of organisational guidelines that vary significantly, even within the same sector. This paper examines AI policies in two domains, news organisations and universities, to understand how bottom-up governance approaches shape AI usage and oversight. By analysing these policies, we identify key areas of convergence and divergence in how organisations address risks such as bias, privacy, misinformation, and accountability. We then explore the implications of these findings for international AI legislation, particularly the EU AI Act, highlighting gaps where practical policy insights could inform regulatory refinements. Our analysis reveals that organisational policies often address issues such as AI literacy, disclosure practices, and environmental impact, areas that are underdeveloped in existing international frameworks. We argue that lessons from domain-specific AI policies can contribute to more adaptive and effective AI governance at the global level. This study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers seeking to bridge the gap between local AI practices and international regulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive health in older adults presents a growing challenge. While conversational interventions show feasibility in improving cognitive wellness, human caregiver resources remain overburdened. AI-based methods have shown promise in providing conversational support, yet existing work is limited to implicit strategy while lacking multi-turn support tailored to seniors. We improve prior art with an LLM-driven chatbot named ChatWise for older adults. It follows dual-level conversation reasoning at the inference phase to provide engaging companionship. ChatWise thrives in long-turn conversations, in contrast to conventional LLMs that primarily excel in short-turn exchanges. Grounded experiments show that ChatWise significantly enhances simulated users' cognitive and emotional status, including those with Mild Cognitive Impairment.</description>

      <title>Alignment, Agency and Autonomy in Frontier AI: A Systems Engineering Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence scales, the concepts of alignment, agency, and autonomy have become central to AI safety, governance, and control. However, even in human contexts, these terms lack universal definitions, varying across disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, law, computer science, mathematics, and political science. This inconsistency complicates their application to AI, where differing interpretations lead to conflicting approaches in system design and regulation. This paper traces the historical, philosophical, and technical evolution of these concepts, emphasizing how their definitions influence AI development, deployment, and oversight.
  We argue that the urgency surrounding AI alignment and autonomy stems not only from technical advancements but also from the increasing deployment of AI in high-stakes decision making. Using Agentic AI as a case study, we examine the emergent properties of machine agency and autonomy, highlighting the risks of misalignment in real-world systems. Through an analysis of automation failures (Tesla Autopilot, Boeing 737 MAX), multi-agent coordination (Metas CICERO), and evolving AI architectures (DeepMinds AlphaZero, OpenAIs AutoGPT), we assess the governance and safety challenges posed by frontier AI.</description>

      <title>CSTRL: Context-Driven Sequential Transfer Learning for Abstractive Radiology Report Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL-Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning-achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving the medical context. Our code is publicly available at TBA.</description>

      <title>SEAFL: Enhancing Efficiency in Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning through Adaptive Aggregation and Selective Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning framework that allows collaborative learning of a global model across decentralized devices without uploading their local data. However, in real-world FL scenarios, the conventional synchronous FL mechanism suffers from inefficient training caused by slow-speed devices, commonly known as stragglers, especially in heterogeneous communication environments. Though asynchronous FL effectively tackles the efficiency challenge, it induces substantial system overheads and model degradation. Striking for a balance, semi-asynchronous FL has gained increasing attention, while still suffering from the open challenge of stale models, where newly arrived updates are calculated based on outdated weights that easily hurt the convergence of the global model. In this paper, we present {\em SEAFL}, a novel FL framework designed to mitigate both the straggler and the stale model challenges in semi-asynchronous FL. {\em SEAFL} dynamically assigns weights to uploaded models during aggregation based on their staleness and importance to the current global model. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of {\em SEAFL} and further enhance the training efficiency with an extended variant that allows partial training on slower devices, enabling them to contribute to global aggregation while reducing excessive waiting times. We evaluate the effectiveness of {\em SEAFL} through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that {\em SEAFL} outperforms its closest counterpart by up to $\sim$22\% in terms of the wall-clock training time required to achieve target accuracy.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Fusion: An Ensemble Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate and generate non-factual outputs which can undermine user trust. Traditional methods to directly mitigate hallucinations, such as representation editing and contrastive decoding, often require additional training data and involve high implementation complexity. While ensemble-based approaches harness multiple LLMs to tap into the "wisdom of crowds", these methods overlook uncertainties in individual model responses. Recent studies reveal that uncertainty estimation can enable LLMs to self-assess the likelihood of generating hallucinations. In this work, we focus on factoid question answering (QA) and observe that LLMs accuracy and self-assessment capabilities vary widely with different models excelling in different scenarios. Leveraging this insight, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF), an ensemble framework to reduces hallucinations by strategically combining multiple LLM based on their accuracy and self-assessment abilities. Empirical results on several public benchmark datasets show that UAF outperforms state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation methods by $8\%$ in factual accuracy, while either narrowing or surpassing the performance gap with GPT-4.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to successfully complete a semester-long undergraduate control systems course. Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a ``minimal effort" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are integral to Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interaction with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) remains an open research challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing graph structures, they struggle with textual feature representation compared to pretrained LMs. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Models (GMLM)} for node classification tasks. Our approach introduces two key innovations: a \textit{semantic masking strategy} that selectively masks nodes based on their structural importance, ensuring critical graph components contribute effectively to learning, and a \textit{soft masking mechanism} that generates interpolated node representations, enabling smoother information retention and improved gradient flow. Our dual-branch model architecture fuses structural graph information with contextual embeddings via a multi-layer fusion network. Extensive experiments on six node classification benchmarks demonstrate that GMLM not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance but also enhances robustness and stability across datasets.</description>

      <title>Encoding Inequity: Examining Demographic Bias in LLM-Driven Robot Caregiving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots take on caregiving roles, ensuring equitable and unbiased interactions with diverse populations is critical. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as key components in shaping robotic behavior, speech, and decision-making, these models may encode and propagate societal biases, leading to disparities in care based on demographic factors. This paper examines how LLM-generated responses shape robot caregiving characteristics and responsibilities when prompted with different demographic information related to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and age. Findings show simplified descriptions for disability and age, lower sentiment for disability and LGBTQ+ identities, and distinct clustering patterns reinforcing stereotypes in caregiving narratives. These results emphasize the need for ethical and inclusive HRI design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is evolving at an unprecedented pace, driven by rapid advancements in machine learning and the recent breakthroughs in large language models. While these innovations hold immense potential to transform clinical decision making, diagnostics, and patient care, the accelerating speed of AI development has outpaced traditional academic publishing cycles. As a result, many scholarly contributions quickly become outdated, failing to capture the latest state of the art methodologies and their real world implications. This paper advocates for a new category of academic publications an annualized citation framework that prioritizes the most recent AI driven healthcare innovations. By systematically referencing the breakthroughs of the year, such papers would ensure that research remains current, fostering a more adaptive and informed discourse. This approach not only enhances the relevance of AI research in healthcare but also provides a more accurate reflection of the fields ongoing evolution.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gender Fair Job Description on Generative AI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STEM fields are traditionally male-dominated, with gender biases shaping perceptions of job accessibility. This study analyzed gender representation in STEM occupation images generated by OpenAI DALL-E 3 \&amp; Black Forest FLUX.1 using 150 prompts in three linguistic forms: German generic masculine, German pair form, and English. As control, 20 pictures of social occupations were generated as well. Results revealed significant male bias across all forms, with the German pair form showing reduced bias but still overrepresenting men for the STEM-Group and mixed results for the Group of Social Occupations. These findings highlight generative AI's role in reinforcing societal biases, emphasizing the need for further discussion on diversity (in AI). Further aspects analyzed are age-distribution and ethnic diversity.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence: Evolving Technology, Growing Societal Impact, and Opportunities for Information Systems Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuing, explosive developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), built on large language models and related algorithms, has led to much excitement and speculation about the potential impact of this new technology. Claims include AI being poised to revolutionize business and society and dramatically change personal life. However, it remains unclear exactly how this technology, with its significantly distinct features from past AI technologies, has transformative potential. Nor is it clear how researchers in information systems (IS) should respond. In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too technical for most IS researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the IS community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of AI.</description>

      <title>Between Innovation and Oversight: A Cross-Regional Study of AI Risk Management Frameworks in the EU, U.S., UK, and China</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly enter important sectors like healthcare, transportation, and finance, the development of effective governance frameworks is crucial for dealing with ethical, security, and societal risks. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of AI risk management strategies across the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK), and China. A multi-method qualitative approach, including comparative policy analysis, thematic analysis, and case studies, investigates how these regions classify AI risks, implement compliance measures, structure oversight, prioritize transparency, and respond to emerging innovations. Examples from high-risk contexts like healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, fintech, and facial recognition demonstrate the advantages and limitations of different regulatory models. The findings show that the EU implements a structured, risk-based framework that prioritizes transparency and conformity assessments, while the U.S. uses decentralized, sector-specific regulations that promote innovation but may lead to fragmented enforcement. The flexible, sector-specific strategy of the UK facilitates agile responses but may lead to inconsistent coverage across domains. China's centralized directives allow rapid large-scale implementation while constraining public transparency and external oversight. These insights show the necessity for AI regulation that is globally informed yet context-sensitive, aiming to balance effective risk management with technological progress. The paper concludes with policy recommendations and suggestions for future research aimed at enhancing effective, adaptive, and inclusive AI governance globally.</description>

      <title>FAA-CLIP: Federated Adversarial Adaptation of CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of vision language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), the large size of these models is a considerable obstacle to their use in federated learning (FL) systems where the parameters of local client models need to be transferred to a global server for aggregation. Another challenge in FL is the heterogeneity of data from different clients, which affects the generalization performance of the solution. In addition, natural pre-trained VLMs exhibit poor generalization ability in the medical datasets, suggests there exists a domain gap. To solve these issues, we introduce a novel method for the Federated Adversarial Adaptation (FAA) of CLIP. Our method, named FAA-CLIP, handles the large communication costs of CLIP using a light-weight feature adaptation module (FAM) for aggregation, effectively adapting this VLM to each client's data while greatly reducing the number of parameters to transfer. By keeping CLIP frozen and only updating the FAM parameters, our method is also computationally efficient. Unlike existing approaches, our FAA-CLIP method directly addresses the problem of domain shifts across clients via a domain adaptation (DA) module. This module employs a domain classifier to predict if a given sample is from the local client or the global server, allowing the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on six different datasets containing both natural and medical images demonstrate that FAA-CLIP can generalize well on both natural and medical datasets compared to recent FL approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/FAA-CLIP.</description>

      <title>Medical Hallucinations in Foundation Models and Their Impact on Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models that are capable of processing and generating multi-modal data have transformed AI's role in medicine. However, a key limitation of their reliability is hallucination, where inaccurate or fabricated information can impact clinical decisions and patient safety. We define medical hallucination as any instance in which a model generates misleading medical content. This paper examines the unique characteristics, causes, and implications of medical hallucinations, with a particular focus on how these errors manifest themselves in real-world clinical scenarios. Our contributions include (1) a taxonomy for understanding and addressing medical hallucinations, (2) benchmarking models using medical hallucination dataset and physician-annotated LLM responses to real medical cases, providing direct insight into the clinical impact of hallucinations, and (3) a multi-national clinician survey on their experiences with medical hallucinations. Our results reveal that inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Search Augmented Generation can effectively reduce hallucination rates. However, despite these improvements, non-trivial levels of hallucination persist. These findings underscore the ethical and practical imperative for robust detection and mitigation strategies, establishing a foundation for regulatory policies that prioritize patient safety and maintain clinical integrity as AI becomes more integrated into healthcare. The feedback from clinicians highlights the urgent need for not only technical advances but also for clearer ethical and regulatory guidelines to ensure patient safety. A repository organizing the paper resources, summaries, and additional information is available at https://github.com/mitmedialab/medical hallucination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dream narratives provide a unique window into human cognition and emotion, yet their systematic analysis using artificial intelligence has been underexplored. We introduce DreamNet, a novel deep learning framework that decodes semantic themes and emotional states from textual dream reports, optionally enhanced with REM-stage EEG data. Leveraging a transformer-based architecture with multimodal attention, DreamNet achieves 92.1% accuracy and 88.4% F1-score in text-only mode (DNet-T) on a curated dataset of 1,500 anonymized dream narratives, improving to 99.0% accuracy and 95.2% F1-score with EEG integration (DNet-M). Strong dream-emotion correlations (e.g., falling-anxiety, r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.01) highlight its potential for mental health diagnostics, cognitive science, and personalized therapy. This work provides a scalable tool, a publicly available enriched dataset, and a rigorous methodology, bridging AI and psychological research.</description>

      <title>Homomorphic Encryption of Intuitionistic Logic Proofs and Functional Programs: A Categorical Approach Inspired by Composite-Order Bilinear Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conceptual framework for extending homomorphic encryption beyond arithmetic or Boolean operations into the domain of intuitionistic logic proofs and, by the Curry-Howard correspondence, into the domain of typed functional programs. We begin by reviewing well-known homomorphic encryption schemes for arithmetic operations, and then discuss the adaptation of similar concepts to support logical inference steps in intuitionistic logic. Key to our construction are polynomial functors and Bounded Natural Functors (BNFs), which serve as a categorical substrate on which logic formulas and proofs are represented and manipulated. We outline a complexity-theoretic hardness assumption -- the BNF Distinguishing Problem, constructed via a reduction from Subgraph Isomorphism, providing a foundation for cryptographic security. Finally, we describe how these methods can homomorphically encode the execution of total, dependently typed functional programs, and outline strategies for making the approach potentially efficient, including software optimizations and hardware acceleration.</description>

      <title>AI Mentors for Student Projects: Spotting Early Issues in Computer Science Proposals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When executed well, project-based learning (PBL) engages students' intrinsic motivation, encourages students to learn far beyond a course's limited curriculum, and prepares students to think critically and maturely about the skills and tools at their disposal. However, educators experience mixed results when using PBL in their classrooms: some students thrive with minimal guidance and others flounder. Early evaluation of project proposals could help educators determine which students need more support, yet evaluating project proposals and student aptitude is time-consuming and difficult to scale. In this work, we design, implement, and conduct an initial user study (n = 36) for a software system that collects project proposals and aptitude information to support educators in determining whether a student is ready to engage with PBL. We find that (1) users perceived the system as helpful for writing project proposals and identifying tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) educator ratings indicate that users with less technical experience in the project topic tend to write lower-quality project proposals, and (3) GPT-4o's ratings show agreement with educator ratings. While the prospect of using LLMs to rate the quality of students' project proposals is promising, its long-term effectiveness strongly hinges on future efforts at characterizing indicators that reliably predict students' success and motivation to learn.</description>

      <title>Knowledge representation and scalable abstract reasoning for simulated democracy in Unity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel form of scalable knowledge representation about agents in a simulated democracy, e-polis, where real users respond to social challenges associated with democratic institutions, structured as Smart Spatial Types, a new type of Smart Building that changes architectural form according to the philosophical doctrine of a visitor. At the end of the game players vote on the Smart City that results from their collective choices. Our approach uses deductive systems in an unusual way: by integrating a model of democracy with a model of a Smart City we are able to prove quality aspects of the simulated democracy in different urban and social settings, while adding ease and flexibility to the development. Second, we can infer and reason with abstract knowledge, which is a limitation of the Unity platform; third, our system enables real-time decision-making and adaptation of the game flow based on the player's abstract state, paving the road to explainability. Scalability is achieved by maintaining a dual-layer knowledge representation mechanism for reasoning about the simulated democracy that functions in a similar way to a two-level cache. The lower layer knows about the current state of the game by continually processing a high rate of events produced by the in-built physics engine of the Unity platform, e.g., it knows of the position of a player in space, in terms of his coordinates x,y,z as well as their choices for each challenge. The higher layer knows of easily-retrievable, user-defined abstract knowledge about current and historical states, e.g., it knows of the political doctrine of a Smart Spatial Type, a player's philosophical doctrine, and the collective philosophical doctrine of a community players with respect to current social issues.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Rights based AI Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether and how to regulate AI is one of the defining questions of our times - a question that is being debated locally, nationally, and internationally. We argue that much of this debate is proceeding on a false premise. Specifically, our article challenges the prevailing academic consensus that the European Union's AI regulatory framework is fundamentally rights-driven and the correlative presumption that other rights-regarding nations should therefore follow Europe's lead in AI regulation. Rather than taking rights language in EU rules and regulations at face value, we show how EU AI regulation is the logical outgrowth of a particular cultural, political, and historical context. We show that although instruments like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the AI Act invoke the language of fundamental rights, these rights are instrumentalized - used as rhetorical cover for governance tools that address systemic risks and maintain institutional stability. As such, we reject claims that the EU's regulatory framework and the substance of its rules should be adopted as universal imperatives and transplanted to other liberal democracies. To add weight to our argument from historical context, we conduct a comparative analysis of AI regulation in five contested domains: data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and misinformation. This EU-US comparison shows that the EU's regulatory architecture is not meaningfully rights-based. Our article's key intervention in AI policy debates is not to suggest that the current American regulatory model is necessarily preferable but that the presumed legitimacy of the EU's AI regulatory approach must be abandoned.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Sports: Insights from a Quantitative Survey among Sports Students in Germany about their Perceptions, Expectations, and Concerns regarding the Use of AI Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05785</link>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini have a crucial impact on academic research and teaching. Empirical data on how students perceive the increasing influence of AI, which different types of tools they use, what they expect from them in their daily academic tasks, and their concerns regarding the use of AI in their studies are still limited. The manuscript presents findings from a quantitative survey conducted among sports students of all semesters in Germany using an online questionnaire. It explores aspects such as students' usage behavior, motivational factors, and uncertainties regarding the impact of AI tools on academia in the future. Furthermore, the social climate in sports studies is being investigated to provide a general overview of the current situation of the students in Germany. Data collection took place between August and November 2023, addressing all sports departments at German universities, with a total of 262 students participating. Our Findings indicate that students have a strong interest in using AI tools in their studies, expecting them to improve their overall academic performance, understand the complexity of scientific approaches, and save time. They express confidence that the proliferation of AI will not compromise their critical thinking skills. Moreover, students are positive about integrating more AI-related topics into the curriculum and about lecturers adopting more AI-based teaching methods. However, our findings also show that students have concerns about plagiarism, lecturer preparedness and their own skills and future skill development.</description>

      <title>Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.</description>

      <title>MedSimAI: Simulation and Formative Feedback Generation to Enhance Deliberate Practice in Medical Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical education faces challenges in scalability, accessibility, and consistency, particularly in clinical skills training for physician-patient communication. Traditional simulation-based learning, while effective, is resource-intensive, difficult to schedule, and often highly variable in feedback quality. Through a collaboration between AI, learning science, and medical education experts, we co-developed MedSimAI, an AI-powered simulation platform that enables deliberate practice, self-regulated learning (SRL), and automated assessment through interactive patient encounters. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), MedSimAI generates realistic clinical interactions and provides immediate, structured feedback using established medical evaluation frameworks such as the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). In a pilot study with 104 first-year medical students, we examined engagement, conversation patterns, and user perceptions. Students found MedSimAI beneficial for repeated, realistic patient-history practice. Conversation analysis revealed that certain higher-order skills were often overlooked, though students generally performed systematic histories and empathic listening. By integrating unlimited practice opportunities, real-time AI assessment, and SRL principles, MedSimAI addresses key limitations of traditional simulation-based training, making high-quality clinical education more accessible and scalable.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Stakeholder Evaluation of ML Models: A Crowdsourcing Study on Metric Preferences in Job-matching System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) technology affects diverse stakeholders, there is no one-size-fits-all metric to evaluate the quality of outputs, including performance and fairness. Using predetermined metrics without soliciting stakeholder opinions is problematic because it leads to an unfair disregard for stakeholders in the ML pipeline. In this study, to establish practical ways to incorporate diverse stakeholder opinions into the selection of metrics for ML, we investigate participants' preferences for different metrics by using crowdsourcing. We ask 837 participants to choose a better model from two hypothetical ML models in a hypothetical job-matching system twenty times and calculate their utility values for seven metrics. To examine the participants' feedback in detail, we divide them into five clusters based on their utility values and analyze the tendencies of each cluster, including their preferences for metrics and common attributes. Based on the results, we discuss the points that should be considered when selecting appropriate metrics and evaluating ML models with multiple stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Fault Localization and State Estimation of Power Grid under Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</description>

      <title>Illuminant and light direction estimation using Wasserstein distance method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Framework via Distributed Mutual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning often relies on sharing full or partial model weights, which can burden network bandwidth and raise privacy risks. We present a loss-based alternative using distributed mutual learning. Instead of transmitting weights, clients periodically share their loss predictions on a public test set. Each client then refines its model by combining its local loss with the average Kullback-Leibler divergence over losses from other clients. This collaborative approach both reduces transmission overhead and preserves data privacy. Experiments on a face mask detection task demonstrate that our method outperforms weight-sharing baselines, achieving higher accuracy on unseen data while providing stronger generalization and privacy benefits.</description>

      <title>Holistically Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Creating Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the performance of artificial intelligence systems has dramatically increased, so too has the environmental impact of creating these systems. While many model developers release estimates of the power consumption and carbon emissions from the final training runs for their latest models, there is comparatively little transparency into the impact of model development, hardware manufacturing, and total water usage throughout. In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of water, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to ~50% of that of training. By looking at detailed time series data for power consumption, we also find that power usage throughout training is not consistent, fluctuating between ~15% and ~85% of our hardware's maximum power draw, with negative implications for grid-scale planning as demand continues to grow. We close with a discussion on the continued difficulty of estimating the environmental impact of AI systems, and key takeaways for model developers and the public at large.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Auto-Bidding with Latent Graph Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</description>

      <title>Intolerable Risk Threshold Recommendations for Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI models -- highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge of AI development -- may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights, economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks could arise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading effects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.
  In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI industry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27 nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these thresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and disclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless adequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''
  To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we outline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not perfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI capabilities and consequently evolving risks. We also propose specific threshold recommendations, including some detailed case studies, for a subset of risks across eight risk categories: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons, (2) Cyber Attacks, (3) Model Autonomy, (4) Persuasion and Manipulation, (5) Deception, (6) Toxicity, (7) Discrimination, and (8) Socioeconomic Disruption. Our goal is to serve as a starting point or supplementary resource for policymakers and industry leaders, encouraging proactive risk management that prioritizes preventing intolerable risks (ex ante) rather than merely mitigating them after they occur (ex post).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large survey of American adults explored the complex landscape of attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). It explored the degree of concern regarding specific potential outcomes of the new advances in AI technology and correlates of these concerns. Key variables associated with the direction and intensity of concern include prior experience using a large language model such as ChatGPT, general trust in science, adherence to the precautionary principle versus support for unrestricted innovation, and demographic factors such as gender. By analyzing these relationships, the paper provides valuable insights into the American public's response to AI that are particularly important in the development of policy to regulate or further encourage its development.</description>

      <title>Will Neural Scaling Laws Activate Jevons' Paradox in AI Labor Markets? A Time-Varying Elasticity of Substitution (VES) Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI industry leaders often use the term ``Jevons' Paradox.'' We explore the significance of this term for artificial intelligence adoption through a time-varying elasticity of substitution framework. We develop a model connecting AI development to labor substitution through four key mechanisms: (1) increased effective computational capacity from both hardware and algorithmic improvements; (2) AI capabilities that rise logarithmically with computation following established neural scaling laws; (3) declining marginal computational costs leading to lower AI prices through competitive pressure; and (4) a resulting increase in the elasticity of substitution between AI and human labor over time. Our time-varying elasticity of substitution (VES) framework, incorporating the G\o rtz identity, yields analytical conditions for market transformation dynamics. This work provides a simple framework to help assess the economic reasoning behind industry claims that AI will increasingly substitute for human labor across diverse economic sectors.</description>

      <title>The impact of AI and peer feedback on research writing skills: a study using the CGScholar platform among Kazakhstani scholars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research studies the impact of AI and peer feedback on the academic writing development of Kazakhstani scholars using the CGScholar platform - a product of research into collaborative learning, big data, and artificial intelligence developed by educators and computer scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The study aimed to find out how familiarity with AI tools and peer feedback processes impacts participants' openness to incorporating feedback into their academic writing. The study involved 36 scholars enrolled in a scientific internship focused on education at UIUC. A survey with 15 multiple-choice questions, a Likert scale, and open-ended questions was used to collect data. The survey was conducted via Google Forms in both English and Russian to ensure linguistic accessibility. Demographic information such as age, gender, and first language was collected to provide a detailed understanding of the data. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between familiarity with AI tools and openness to making changes based on feedback, and a strong positive correlation between research writing experience and expectations of peer feedback, especially in the area of research methodology. These results show that participants are open-minded to AI-assisted feedback; however, they still highly appreciate peer input, especially regarding methodological guidance. This study demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating AI tools with traditional feedback mechanisms to improve research writing quality in academic settings.</description>

      <title>AI-Facilitated Collective Judgements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article unpacks the design choices behind longstanding and newly proposed computational frameworks aimed at finding common grounds across collective preferences and examines their potential future impacts, both technically and normatively. It begins by situating AI-assisted preference elicitation within the historical role of opinion polls, emphasizing that preferences are shaped by the decision-making context and are seldom objectively captured. With that caveat in mind, we explore AI-facilitated collective judgment as a discovery tool for fostering reasonable representations of a collective will, sense-making, and agreement-seeking. At the same time, we caution against dangerously misguided uses, such as enabling binding decisions, fostering gradual disempowerment or post-rationalizing political outcomes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Force Fields: Fundamentals, its reach, and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly accurate force fields are a mandatory requirement to generate predictive simulations. In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Extracting and Emulsifying Cultural Explanation to Improve Multilingual Capability of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their English-centric training data limits performance in non-English languages, highlighting the need for enhancements in their multilingual capabilities. While some work on multilingual prompting methods handles non-English queries by utilizing English translations or restructuring them to more closely align with LLM reasoning patterns, these works often overlook the importance of cultural context, limiting their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose EMCEI, a simple yet effective approach that improves LLMs' multilingual capabilities by incorporating cultural context for more accurate and appropriate responses. Specifically, EMCEI follows a two-step process that first extracts relevant cultural context from the LLM's parametric knowledge via prompting. Then, EMCEI employs an LLM-as-Judge mechanism to select the most appropriate response by balancing cultural relevance and reasoning ability. Experiments on diverse multilingual benchmarks show that EMCEI outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling multilingual queries with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation: INFINITE Methodology for Defining the Inference Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new methodology for an Inference Index (InI), called INFerence INdex In Testing model Effectiveness methodology (INFINITE), aiming to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. The InI index provides a comprehensive assessment focusing on three key components: efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. This approach encapsulates time-based efficiency, response quality, and the stability of model outputs, offering a thorough understanding of LLM performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics. We applied this methodology to compare OpenAI's GPT-4o (GPT), OpenAI-o1 pro (OAI1), and OpenAI-o3 mini-high (OAI3) in generating Python code for the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model to forecast meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Our findings demonstrate that GPT outperforms OAI1 and performs comparably to OAI3 regarding accuracy and workflow efficiency. The study reveals that LLM-assisted code generation can produce results similar to expert-designed models with effective prompting and refinement. GPT's performance advantage highlights the benefits of widespread use and user feedback.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Earth Science Discovery via Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Perspective explores the transformative potential of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the geosciences. Users of geoscientific data repositories face challenges due to the complexity and diversity of data formats, inconsistent metadata practices, and a considerable number of unprocessed datasets. MAS possesses transformative potential for improving scientists' interaction with geoscientific data by enabling intelligent data processing, natural language interfaces, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities. We illustrate this approach with "PANGAEA GPT", a specialized MAS pipeline integrated with the diverse PANGAEA database for Earth and Environmental Science, demonstrating how MAS-driven workflows can effectively manage complex datasets and accelerate scientific discovery. We discuss how MAS can address current data challenges in geosciences, highlight advancements in other scientific fields, and propose future directions for integrating MAS into geoscientific data processing pipelines. In this Perspective, we show how MAS can fundamentally improve data accessibility, promote cross-disciplinary collaboration, and accelerate geoscientific discoveries.</description>

      <title>This Is Your Doge, If It Please You: Exploring Deception and Robustness in Mixture of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture of large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA) architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a $\textit{single}$ carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance.</description>

      <title>SYMBIOSIS: Systems Thinking and Machine Intelligence for Better Outcomes in Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SYMBIOSIS, an AI-powered framework and platform designed to make Systems Thinking accessible for addressing societal challenges and unlock paths for leveraging systems thinking frameworks to improve AI systems. The platform establishes a centralized, open-source repository of systems thinking/system dynamics models categorized by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and societal topics using topic modeling and classification techniques. Systems Thinking resources, though critical for articulating causal theories in complex problem spaces, are often locked behind specialized tools and intricate notations, creating high barriers to entry. To address this, we developed a generative co-pilot that translates complex systems representations - such as causal loop and stock-flow diagrams - into natural language (and vice-versa), allowing users to explore and build models without extensive technical training.
  Rooted in community-based system dynamics (CBSD) and informed by community-driven insights on societal context, we aim to bridge the problem understanding chasm. This gap, driven by epistemic uncertainty, often limits ML developers who lack the community-specific knowledge essential for problem understanding and formulation, often leading to ill informed causal assumptions, reduced intervention effectiveness and harmful biases. Recent research identifies causal and abductive reasoning as crucial frontiers for AI, and Systems Thinking provides a naturally compatible framework for both. By making Systems Thinking frameworks more accessible and user-friendly, SYMBIOSIS aims to serve as a foundational step to unlock future research into responsible and society-centered AI. Our work underscores the need for ongoing research into AI's capacity to understand essential characteristics of complex adaptive systems paving the way for more socially attuned, effective AI systems.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI Models in Software Engineering: A Review, Search Tool, and Enhancement Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for consistent evaluation and reproducibility. The integration of Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (AI4SE) has given rise to numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, this surge presents challenges: (1) scattered benchmark knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting relevant benchmarks, (3) the absence of a uniform standard for benchmark development, and (4) limitations of existing benchmarks. In this paper, we review 173 studies and identify 204 AI4SE benchmarks. We classify these benchmarks, analyze their limitations, and expose gaps in practices. Based on our review, we created BenchScout, a semantic search tool to find relevant benchmarks, using automated clustering of the contexts from associated studies. We conducted a user study with 22 participants to evaluate BenchScout's usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness which resulted in average scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5. To advance benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified method to enhance benchmark quality. As a case study, we applied BenchFrame to the HumanEval benchmark and addressed its main limitations. This led to HumanEvalNext, featuring (1) corrected errors, (2) improved language conversion, (3) expanded test coverage, and (4) increased difficulty. We then evaluated ten state-of-the-art code language models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and HumanEvalNext. On HumanEvalNext, models showed a pass@1 score reduction of 31.22% and 19.94% compared to HumanEval and HumanEvalPlus, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era where data-driven decision-making and computational efficiency are paramount, optimization plays a foundational role in advancing fields such as mathematics, computer science, operations research, machine learning, and beyond. From refining machine learning models to improving resource allocation and designing efficient algorithms, optimization techniques serve as essential tools for tackling complex problems. This book aims to provide both an introductory guide and a comprehensive reference, equipping readers with the necessary knowledge to understand and apply optimization methods within their respective fields.
  Our primary goal is to demystify the inner workings of optimization algorithms, including black-box and stochastic optimizers, by offering both formal and intuitive explanations. Starting from fundamental mathematical principles, we derive key results to ensure that readers not only learn how these techniques work but also understand when and why to apply them effectively. By striking a careful balance between theoretical depth and practical application, this book serves a broad audience, from students and researchers to practitioners seeking robust optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>QG-SMS: Enhancing Test Item Analysis via Student Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Question Generation (QG) task has been increasingly adopted in educational assessments, its evaluation remains limited by approaches that lack a clear connection to the educational values of test items. In this work, we introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our extensive experiments and human evaluation study, the additional perspectives introduced by the simulated student profiles lead to a more effective and robust assessment of test items.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Medical Event Prediction Using a Generative Pre-trained Transformer on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Foundational models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models enhances task-specific performance, it is costly, complex, and unsustainable for every target. We show that a foundation model trained on EHRs can perform predictive tasks in a zero-shot manner, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.
  Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.
  We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings.</description>

Abstract: Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people have adopted AI-powered visual interpretation applications to address their daily needs. While these applications have been helpful, prior work has found that users remain unsatisfied by their frequent errors. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications, and they show promise for more descriptive visual interpretations. However, it is still unknown how this advancement has changed people's use of these applications. To address this gap, we conducted a two-week diary study in which 20 BLV people used an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application we developed, and we collected 553 entries. In this paper, we report a preliminary analysis of 60 diary entries from 6 participants. We found that participants considered the application's visual interpretations trustworthy (mean 3.75 out of 5) and satisfying (mean 4.15 out of 5). Moreover, participants trusted our application in high-stakes scenarios, such as receiving medical dosage advice. We discuss our plan to complete our analysis to inform the design of future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation systems.</description>

      <title>SAS: Segment Anything Small for Ultrasound -- A Non-Generative Data Augmentation Technique for Robust Deep Learning in Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound (US) images, particularly small ones, is challenging due to noise and variability in imaging conditions (e.g., probe position, patient anatomy, tissue characteristics and pathology). To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a simple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting small anatomical structures in ultrasound images. SAS employs a dual transformation strategy: (1) simulating diverse organ scales by resizing and embedding organ thumbnails into a black background, and (2) injecting noise into regions of interest to simulate varying tissue textures. These transformations generate realistic and diverse training data without introducing hallucinations or artifacts, improving the model's robustness to noise and variability. We fine-tuned a promptable foundation model on a controlled organ-specific medical imaging dataset and evaluated its performance on one internal and five external datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score gains of up to 0.35 and an average improvement of 0.16 [95% CI 0.132,0.188]. Additionally, our iterative point prompts provide precise control and adaptive refinement, achieving performance comparable to bounding box prompts with just two points. SAS enhances model robustness and generalizability across diverse anatomical structures and imaging conditions, particularly for small structures, without compromising the accuracy of larger ones. By offering a computationally efficient solution that eliminates the need for extensive human labeling efforts, SAS emerges as a powerful tool for advancing medical image analysis, particularly in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>IDEA Prune: An Integrated Enlarge-and-Prune Pipeline in Generative Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have intensified the need for efficient and deployable models within limited inference budgets. Structured pruning pipelines have shown promise in token efficiency compared to training target-size models from scratch. In this paper, we advocate incorporating enlarged model pretraining, which is often ignored in previous works, into pruning. We study the enlarge-and-prune pipeline as an integrated system to address two critical questions: whether it is worth pretraining an enlarged model even when the model is never deployed, and how to optimize the entire pipeline for better pruned models. We propose an integrated enlarge-and-prune pipeline, which combines enlarge model training, pruning, and recovery under a single cosine annealing learning rate schedule. This approach is further complemented by a novel iterative structured pruning method for gradual parameter removal. The proposed method helps to mitigate the knowledge loss caused by the rising learning rate in naive enlarge-and-prune pipelines and enable effective redistribution of model capacity among surviving neurons, facilitating smooth compression and enhanced performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on compressing 2.8B models to 1.3B with up to 2T tokens in pretraining. It demonstrates the integrated approach not only provides insights into the token efficiency of enlarged model pretraining but also achieves superior performance of pruned models.</description>

      <title>ElementaryNet: A Non-Strategic Neural Network for Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of human behavior in game-theoretic settings often distinguish between strategic behavior, in which a player both reasons about how others will act and best responds to these beliefs, and "level-0" non-strategic behavior, in which they do not respond to explicit beliefs about others. The state of the art for predicting human behavior on unrepeated simultaneous-move games is GameNet, a neural network that learns extremely complex level-0 specifications from data. The current paper makes three contributions. First, it shows that GameNet's level-0 specifications are too powerful, because they are capable of strategic reasoning. Second, it introduces a novel neural network architecture (dubbed ElementaryNet) and proves that it is only capable of nonstrategic behavior. Third, it describes an extensive experimental evaluation of ElementaryNet. Our overall findings are that (1) ElementaryNet dramatically underperforms GameNet when neither model is allowed to explicitly model higher level agents who best-respond to the model's predictions, indicating that good performance on our dataset requires a model capable of strategic reasoning; (2) that the two models achieve statistically indistinguishable performance when such higher-level agents are introduced, meaning that ElementaryNet's restriction to a non-strategic level-0 specification does not degrade model performance; and (3) that this continues to hold even when ElementaryNet is restricted to a set of level-0 building blocks previously introduced in the literature, with only the functional form being learned by the neural network.</description>

      <title>Audio-to-Image Encoding for Improved Voice Characteristic Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel audio-to-image encoding framework that integrates multiple dimensions of voice characteristics into a single RGB image for speaker recognition. In this method, the green channel encodes raw audio data, the red channel embeds statistical descriptors of the voice signal (including key metrics such as median and mean values for fundamental frequency, spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff, zero-crossing rate, MFCCs, RMS energy, spectral flatness, spectral contrast, chroma, and harmonic-to-noise ratio), and the blue channel comprises subframes representing these features in a spatially organized format. A deep convolutional neural network trained on these composite images achieves 98% accuracy in speaker classification across two speakers, suggesting that this integrated multi-channel representation can provide a more discriminative input for voice recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>The Unified Control Framework: Establishing a Common Foundation for Enterprise AI Governance, Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI systems presents enterprises with a dual challenge: accelerating innovation while ensuring responsible governance. Current AI governance approaches suffer from fragmentation, with risk management frameworks that focus on isolated domains, regulations that vary across jurisdictions despite conceptual alignment, and high-level standards lacking concrete implementation guidance. This fragmentation increases governance costs and creates a false dichotomy between innovation and responsibility. We propose the Unified Control Framework (UCF): a comprehensive governance approach that integrates risk management and regulatory compliance through a unified set of controls. The UCF consists of three key components: (1) a comprehensive risk taxonomy synthesizing organizational and societal risks, (2) structured policy requirements derived from regulations, and (3) a parsimonious set of 42 controls that simultaneously address multiple risk scenarios and compliance requirements. We validate the UCF by mapping it to the Colorado AI Act, demonstrating how our approach enables efficient, adaptable governance that scales across regulations while providing concrete implementation guidance. The UCF reduces duplication of effort, ensures comprehensive coverage, and provides a foundation for automation, enabling organizations to achieve responsible AI governance without sacrificing innovation speed.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification From Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty from machine learning analyses is critical to their use in the physical sciences. In this work we focus on uncertainty inherited from the initialization distribution of neural networks. We compute the mean $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2$ of the test loss $\mathcal{L}$ for an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization in the infinite-width limit, and compare empirically to the results from finite-width networks for three example tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR classification and calorimeter energy regression. We observe scaling laws as a function of training set size $N_\mathcal{D}$ for both $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}$, but find that the coefficient of variation $\epsilon_{\mathcal{L}} \equiv \sigma_{\mathcal{L}}/\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ becomes independent of $N_\mathcal{D}$ at both infinite and finite width for sufficiently large $N_\mathcal{D}$. This implies that the coefficient of variation of a finite-width network may be approximated by its infinite-width value, and may in principle be calculable using finite-width perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>TPU-Gen: LLM-Driven Custom Tensor Processing Unit Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) necessitate specialized tensor accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to meet various computational and energy efficiency requirements. Nevertheless, designing optimal TPU remains challenging due to the high domain expertise level, considerable manual design time, and lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. This paper introduces TPU-Gen, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based framework designed to automate the exact and approximate TPU generation process, focusing on systolic array architectures. TPU-Gen is supported with a meticulously curated, comprehensive, and open-source dataset that covers a wide range of spatial array designs and approximate multiply-and-accumulate units, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization for different DNN workloads. The proposed framework leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an effective solution for a data-scare hardware domain in building LLMs, addressing the most intriguing issue, hallucinations. TPU-Gen transforms high-level architectural specifications into optimized low-level implementations through an effective hardware generation pipeline. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance, power, and area efficiency, with an average reduction in area and power of 92\% and 96\% from the manual optimization reference values. These results set new standards for driving advancements in next-generation design automation tools powered by LLMs.</description>

      <title>SANDWiCH: Semantical Analysis of Neighbours for Disambiguating Words in Context ad Hoc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of generative chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) over the past two years has spurred a race to develop systems that promise near-human conversational and reasoning experiences. However, recent studies indicate that the language understanding offered by these models remains limited and far from human-like performance, particularly in grasping the contextual meanings of words, an essential aspect of reasoning. In this paper, we present a simple yet computationally efficient framework for multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Our approach reframes the WSD task as a cluster discrimination analysis over a semantic network refined from BabelNet using group algebra. We validate our methodology across multiple WSD benchmarks, achieving a new state of the art for all languages and tasks, as well as in individual assessments by part of speech. Notably, our model significantly surpasses the performance of current alternatives, even in low-resource languages, while reducing the parameter count by 72%.</description>

Abstract: Practitioners and researchers trying to strike a balance between accuracy and transparency center Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) at the junction of finance. This paper offers a thorough overview of the changing scene of XAI applications in finance together with domain-specific implementations, methodological developments, and trend mapping of research. Using bibliometric and content analysis, we find topic clusters, significant research, and most often used explainability strategies used in financial industries. Our results show a substantial dependence on post-hoc interpretability techniques; attention mechanisms, feature importance analysis and SHAP are the most often used techniques among them. This review stresses the need of multidisciplinary approaches combining financial knowledge with improved explainability paradigms and exposes important shortcomings in present XAI systems.</description>

      <title>A Real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network-powered Wildfire Forecasting System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most dangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.</description>

      <title>Optimal sensor deception in stochastic environments with partial observability to mislead a robot to a decoy goal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deception is a common strategy adapted by autonomous systems in adversarial settings. Existing deception methods primarily focus on increasing opacity or misdirecting agents away from their goal or itinerary. In this work, we propose a deception problem aiming to mislead the robot towards a decoy goal through altering sensor events under a constrained budget of alteration. The environment along with the robot's interaction with it is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and the robot's action selection is governed by a Finite State Controller (FSC). Given a constrained budget for sensor event modifications, the objective is to compute a sensor alteration that maximizes the probability of the robot reaching a decoy goal. We establish the computational hardness of the problem by a reduction from the $0/1$ Knapsack problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to compute optimal deception strategies. We show the efficacy of our MILP formulation via a sequence of experiments.</description>

      <title>Is Your Video Language Model a Reliable Judge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As video language models (VLMs) gain more applications in various scenarios, the need for robust and scalable evaluation of their performance becomes increasingly critical. The traditional human expert-based evaluation of VLMs has limitations in consistency and scalability, which sparked interest in automatic methods such as employing VLMs to evaluate VLMs. However, the reliability of VLMs as judges remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on a single VLM as the evaluator. However, this approach can be unreliable or biased because such a model may lack the ability to fully understand the content and may have inherent biases, ultimately compromising evaluation reliability. A remedy is to apply the principle of collective thoughts, aggregating evaluations from multiple VLMs to enhance reliability. This study investigates the efficacy of such approaches, particularly when the pool of judges includes both reliable and unreliable models. Our findings reveal that incorporating collective judgments from such a mixed pool does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the final evaluation. The inclusion of less reliable judges can introduce noise, undermining the overall reliability of the outcomes. To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we fine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved understanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable. These findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and highlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the reliability of individual models. Our study promotes the development of more reliable evaluation methods for VLMs</description>

      <title>Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</description>

      <title>SINdex: Semantic INconsistency Index for Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet they are prone to generating factually incorrect outputs - commonly known as "hallucinations." Among existing mitigation strategies, uncertainty-based methods are particularly attractive due to their ease of implementation, independence from external data, and compatibility with standard LLMs. In this work, we introduce a novel and scalable uncertainty-based semantic clustering framework for automated hallucination detection. Our approach leverages sentence embeddings and hierarchical clustering alongside a newly proposed inconsistency measure, SINdex, to yield more homogeneous clusters and more accurate detection of hallucination phenomena across various LLMs. Evaluations on prominent open- and closed-book QA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves AUROC improvements of up to 9.3% over state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in our framework.</description>

      <title>Black Box Causal Inference: Effect Estimation via Meta Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference and the estimation of causal effects plays a central role in decision-making across many areas, including healthcare and economics. Estimating causal effects typically requires an estimator that is tailored to each problem of interest. But developing estimators can take significant effort for even a single causal inference setting. For example, algorithms for regression-based estimators, propensity score methods, and doubly robust methods were designed across several decades to handle causal estimation with observed confounders. Similarly, several estimators have been developed to exploit instrumental variables (IVs), including two-stage least-squares (TSLS), control functions, and the method-of-moments. In this work, we instead frame causal inference as a dataset-level prediction problem, offloading algorithm design to the learning process. The approach we introduce, called black box causal inference (BBCI), builds estimators in a black-box manner by learning to predict causal effects from sampled dataset-effect pairs. We demonstrate accurate estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs) and conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) with BBCI across several causal inference problems with known identification, including problems with less developed estimators.</description>

      <title>GrInAdapt: Scaling Retinal Vessel Structural Map Segmentation Through Grounding, Integrating and Adapting Multi-device, Multi-site, and Multi-modal Fundus Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosing ocular conditions, yet current deep learning methods are limited by modality-specific challenges and significant distribution shifts across imaging devices, resolutions, and anatomical regions. In this paper, we propose GrInAdapt, a novel framework for source-free multi-target domain adaptation that leverages multi-view images to refine segmentation labels and enhance model generalizability for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the fundus of the eye. GrInAdapt follows an intuitive three-step approach: (i) grounding images to a common anchor space via registration, (ii) integrating predictions from multiple views to achieve improved label consensus, and (iii) adapting the source model to diverse target domains. Furthermore, GrInAdapt is flexible enough to incorporate auxiliary modalities such as color fundus photography, to provide complementary cues for robust vessel segmentation. Extensive experiments on a multi-device, multi-site, and multi-modal retinal dataset demonstrate that GrInAdapt significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness across multiple domains. These results highlight the potential of GrInAdapt to advance automated retinal vessel analysis and support robust clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Towards Improving Reward Design in RL: A Reward Alignment Metric for RL Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drive by Imitating Surrounding Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Intent-Aware Self-Correction for Mitigating Social Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Correction based on feedback improves the output quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). Moreover, as Self-Correction functions like the slow and conscious System-2 thinking from cognitive psychology's perspective, it can potentially reduce LLMs' social biases. LLMs are sensitive to contextual ambiguities and inconsistencies; therefore, explicitly communicating their intentions during interactions when applying Self-Correction for debiasing is crucial. In this study, we demonstrate that clarifying intentions is essential for effectively reducing biases in LLMs through Self-Correction. We divide the components needed for Self-Correction into three parts: instruction, response, and feedback, and clarify intentions at each component. We incorporate an explicit debiasing prompt to convey the intention of bias mitigation from the instruction for response generation. In the response, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to clarify the reasoning process. In the feedback, we define evaluation aspects necessary for debiasing and propose clear feedback through multi-aspect critiques and scoring. Through experiments, we demonstrate that self-correcting CoT responses obtained from a debiasing prompt based on multi-aspect feedback can reduce biased responses more robustly and consistently than the baselines. We also find the variation in debiasing efficacy when using models with different bias levels or separating models for response and feedback generation.</description>

      <title>Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Peg Insertion: Identifying Mating Holes and Estimating SE(2) Poses with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving zero-shot peg insertion, where inserting an arbitrary peg into an unseen hole without task-specific training, remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This task demands a highly generalizable perception system capable of detecting potential holes, selecting the correct mating hole from multiple candidates, estimating its precise pose, and executing insertion despite uncertainties. While learning-based methods have been applied to peg insertion, they often fail to generalize beyond the specific peg-hole pairs encountered during training. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging large-scale datasets to enable robust generalization across diverse tasks. Inspired by their success, we introduce a novel zero-shot peg insertion framework that utilizes a VLM to identify mating holes and estimate their poses without prior knowledge of their geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 90.2% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines in identifying the correct mating hole across a wide range of previously unseen peg-hole pairs, including 3D-printed objects, toy puzzles, and industrial connectors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world connector insertion task on a backpanel of a PC, where our system successfully detects holes, identifies the correct mating hole, estimates its pose, and completes the insertion with a success rate of 88.3%. These results highlight the potential of VLM-driven zero-shot reasoning for enabling robust and generalizable robotic assembly.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Text-driven CT Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is extensively used for accurate visualization and segmentation of organs and lesions. While deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have significantly improved CT image analysis, their performance often declines when applied to diverse, real-world clinical data. Although foundation models offer a broader and more adaptable solution, their potential is limited due to the challenge of obtaining large-scale, voxel-level annotations for medical images. In response to these challenges, prompting-based models using visual or text prompts have emerged. Visual-prompting methods, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), still require significant manual input and can introduce ambiguity when applied to clinical scenarios. Instead, foundation models that use text prompts offer a more versatile and clinically relevant approach. Notably, current text-prompt models, such as the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, are limited to text prompts already encountered during training and struggle to process the complex and diverse scenarios of real-world clinical applications. Instead of fine-tuning models trained from natural imaging, we propose OpenVocabCT, a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale 3D CT images for universal text-driven segmentation. Using the large-scale CT-RATE dataset, we decompose the diagnostic reports into fine-grained, organ-level descriptions using large language models for multi-granular contrastive learning. We evaluate our OpenVocabCT on downstream segmentation tasks across nine public datasets for organ and tumor segmentation, demonstrating the superior performance of our model compared to existing methods. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly released at https://github.com/ricklisz/OpenVocabCT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Control as Inference (CAI) framework has successfully transformed single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) by reframing control tasks as probabilistic inference problems. However, the extension of CAI to multi-agent, general-sum stochastic games (SGs) remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized settings where agents operate independently without centralized coordination. In this paper, we propose a novel variational inference framework tailored to decentralized multi-agent systems. Our framework addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and unaligned agent objectives, proving that the resulting policies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed decentralized algorithms. Leveraging this framework, we instantiate multiple algorithms to solve for Nash equilibrium, mean-field Nash equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium, with rigorous theoretical convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Bias Detection in LLM: Enhancing detection mechanisms for nuanced biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed natural language processing by improving generative capabilities. However, detecting biases embedded within these models remains a challenge. Subtle biases can propagate misinformation, influence decision-making, and reinforce stereotypes, raising ethical concerns. This study presents a detection framework to identify nuanced biases in LLMs. The approach integrates contextual analysis, interpretability via attention mechanisms, and counterfactual data augmentation to capture hidden biases across linguistic contexts. The methodology employs contrastive prompts and synthetic datasets to analyze model behaviour across cultural, ideological, and demographic scenarios.
  Quantitative analysis using benchmark datasets and qualitative assessments through expert reviews validate the effectiveness of the framework. Results show improvements in detecting subtle biases compared to conventional methods, which often fail to highlight disparities in model responses to race, gender, and socio-political contexts. The framework also identifies biases arising from imbalances in training data and model architectures. Continuous user feedback ensures adaptability and refinement. This research underscores the importance of proactive bias mitigation strategies and calls for collaboration between policymakers, AI developers, and regulators. The proposed detection mechanisms enhance model transparency and support responsible LLM deployment in sensitive applications such as education, legal systems, and healthcare. Future work will focus on real-time bias monitoring and cross-linguistic generalization to improve fairness and inclusivity in AI-driven communication tools.</description>

      <title>STAR: A Foundation Model-driven Framework for Robust Task Planning and Failure Recovery in Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to domestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision and adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Trustworthy Video Summarization Algorithm Through a Mixture of LoRA Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of user-generated content on video-sharing platforms, the challenge of facilitating efficient searching and browsing of videos has garnered significant attention. To enhance users' ability to swiftly locate and review pertinent videos, the creation of concise and informative video summaries has become increasingly important. Video-llama is an effective tool for generating video summarization, but it cannot effectively unify and optimize the modeling of temporal and spatial features and requires a lot of computational resources and time. Therefore, we propose MiLoRA-ViSum to more efficiently capture complex temporal dynamics and spatial relationships inherent in video data and to control the number of parameters for training. By extending traditional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a sophisticated mixture-of-experts paradigm, MiLoRA-ViSum incorporates a dual temporal-spatial adaptation mechanism tailored specifically for video summarization tasks. This approach dynamically integrates specialized LoRA experts, each fine-tuned to address distinct temporal or spatial dimensions. Extensive evaluations of the VideoXum and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that MiLoRA-ViSum achieves the best summarization performance compared to state-of-the-art models, while maintaining significantly lower computational costs. The proposed mixture-of-experts strategy, combined with the dual adaptation mechanism, highlights the model's potential to enhance video summarization capabilities, particularly in large-scale applications requiring both efficiency and precision.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Post-training of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06072</link>

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed natural language processing, making them indispensable across domains ranging from conversational systems to scientific exploration. However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization amidst increasing complexity; and Integration and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues. Charting progress from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and enhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis of PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets, and a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work consolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual framework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in precision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal applications.</description>

      <title>GEM: Empowering MLLM for Grounded ECG Understanding with Time Series and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

      <title>Towards Conversational AI for Disease Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.</description>

      <title>T-CBF: Traversability-based Control Barrier Function to Navigate Vertically Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety has been of paramount importance in motion planning and control techniques and is an active area of research in the past few years. Most safety research for mobile robots target at maintaining safety with the notion of collision avoidance. However, safety goes beyond just avoiding collisions, especially when robots have to navigate unstructured, vertically challenging, off-road terrain, where vehicle rollover and immobilization is as critical as collisions. In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position. T-CBF planner outperforms previously developed planners by 30\% in terms of keeping the robot safe and mobile when navigating on real world vertically challenging terrain.</description>

      <title>ZO-DARTS++: An Efficient and Size-Variable Zeroth-Order Neural Architecture Search Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a promising avenue for automating the complex design of deep learning (DL) models. However, current differentiable NAS methods often face constraints in efficiency, operation selection, and adaptability under varying resource limitations. We introduce ZO-DARTS++, a novel NAS method that effectively balances performance and resource constraints. By integrating a zeroth-order approximation for efficient gradient handling, employing a sparsemax function with temperature annealing for clearer and more interpretable architecture distributions, and adopting a size-variable search scheme for generating compact yet accurate architectures, ZO-DARTS++ establishes a new balance between model complexity and performance. In extensive tests on medical imaging datasets, ZO-DARTS++ improves the average accuracy by up to 1.8\% over standard DARTS-based methods and shortens search time by approximately 38.6\%. Additionally, its resource-constrained variants can reduce the number of parameters by more than 35\% while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Thus, ZO-DARTS++ offers a versatile and efficient framework for generating high-quality, resource-aware DL models suitable for real-world medical applications.</description>

      <title>ULTHO: Ultra-Lightweight yet Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to image dehazing by combining Feature Fusion Attention (FFA) networks with CycleGAN architecture. Our method leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to effectively remove haze from images while preserving crucial image details. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates significant improvements in image quality metrics, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores compared to traditional dehazing methods. Through extensive experimentation on the RESIDE and DenseHaze CVPR 2019 dataset, we show that our approach effectively handles both synthetic and real-world hazy images. CycleGAN handles the unpaired nature of hazy and clean images effectively, enabling the model to learn mappings even without paired data.</description>

      <title>GSV3D: Gaussian Splatting-based Geometric Distillation with Stable Video Diffusion for Single-Image 3D Object Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based 3D generation has vast applications in robotics and gaming, where high-quality, diverse outputs and consistent 3D representations are crucial. However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the usage of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Ionospheric electron density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of traditional Neural Networks (NN) in predictive modelling is their inability to quantify uncertainty in their outputs. In critical applications like positioning systems, understanding the reliability of predictions is critical for constructing confidence intervals, early warning systems, and effectively propagating results. For instance, Precise Point Positioning in satellite navigation heavily relies on accurate error models for ancillary data (orbits, clocks, ionosphere, and troposphere) to compute precise error estimates. In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to establish robust protection levels in safety critical applications.
  To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at exploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and associated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC). In this context, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a promising approach to achieve this goal. However, constructing an effective PNN requires meticulous design of hidden and output layers, as well as careful definition of prior and posterior probability distributions for network weights and biases.
  A key finding of this study is that the uncertainty provided by the PNN model in VTEC estimates may be systematically underestimated. In low-latitude areas, the actual error was observed to be as much as twice the model's estimate. This underestimation is expected to be more pronounced during solar maximum, correlating with increased VTEC values.</description>

Abstract: Large multimodal models exhibit remarkable intelligence, yet their embodied cognitive abilities during motion in open-ended urban 3D space remain to be explored. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate whether video-large language models (Video-LLMs) can naturally process continuous first-person visual observations like humans, enabling recall, perception, reasoning, and navigation. We have manually control drones to collect 3D embodied motion video data from real-world cities and simulated environments, resulting in 1.5k video clips. Then we design a pipeline to generate 5.2k multiple-choice questions. Evaluations of 17 widely-used Video-LLMs reveal current limitations in urban embodied cognition. Correlation analysis provides insight into the relationships between different tasks, showing that causal reasoning has a strong correlation with recall, perception, and navigation, while the abilities for counterfactual and associative reasoning exhibit lower correlation with other tasks. We also validate the potential for Sim-to-Real transfer in urban embodiment through fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Feature-EndoGaussian: Feature Distilled Gaussian Splatting in Surgical Deformable Scene Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has transformed clinical practice by reducing recovery times, minimizing complications, and enhancing precision. Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.</description>

      <title>Secure On-Device Video OOD Detection Without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dystopians/SecDOOD.</description>

      <title>Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability.

      <title>ROCM: RLHF on consistency models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs.
  In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.</description>

      <title>Minion Gated Recurrent Unit for Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for continual learning in sequential data processing has led to progressively complex training methodologies and larger recurrent network architectures. Consequently, this has widened the knowledge gap between continual learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their ability to operate on devices with limited memory and compute. To address this challenge, we investigate the effectiveness of simplifying RNN architectures, particularly gated recurrent unit (GRU), and its impact on both single-task and multitask sequential learning. We propose a new variant of GRU, namely the minion recurrent unit (MiRU). MiRU replaces conventional gating mechanisms with scaling coefficients to regulate dynamic updates of hidden states and historical context, reducing computational costs and memory requirements. Despite its simplified architecture, MiRU maintains performance comparable to the standard GRU while achieving 2.90x faster training and reducing parameter usage by 2.88x, as demonstrated through evaluations on sequential image classification and natural language processing benchmarks. The impact of model simplification on its learning capacity is also investigated by performing continual learning tasks with a rehearsal-based strategy and global inhibition. We find that MiRU demonstrates stable performance in multitask learning even when using only rehearsal, unlike the standard GRU and its variants. These features position MiRU as a promising candidate for edge-device applications.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Software Kernels and Hardware Extensions for Efficient Sparse Deep Neural Networks on Microcontrollers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of pruned Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices such as Microcontrollers (MCUs) is a challenging task, given the tight area- and power-constraints of these devices. In this work, we propose a three-fold contribution to address this problem. First, we design a set of optimized software kernels for N:M pruned layers, targeting ultra-low-power, multicore RISC-V MCUs, which are up to 2.1x and 3.4x faster than their dense counterparts at 1:8 and 1:16 sparsity, respectively. Then, we implement a lightweight Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA) extension to accelerate the indirect load and non-zero indices decompression operations required by our kernels, obtaining up to 1.9x extra speedup, at the cost of a 5% area overhead. Lastly, we extend an open-source DNN compiler to utilize our sparse kernels for complete networks, showing speedups of 3.21x and 1.81x on a ResNet18 and a Vision Transformer (ViT), with less than 1.5% accuracy drop compared to a dense baseline.</description>

      <title>Sample-aware Adaptive Structured Pruning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance in natural language processing, but enormous model sizes and high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Structured pruning can effectively reduce the resource demands for deployment by removing redundant model parameters. However, the randomly selected calibration data and fixed single importance estimation metrics in existing structured pruning methods lead to degraded performance of pruned models. This study introduces AdaPruner, a sample-aware adaptive structured pruning framework for LLMs, aiming to optimize the calibration data and importance estimation metrics in the structured pruning process. Specifically, AdaPruner effectively removes redundant parameters from LLMs by constructing a structured pruning solution space and then employing Bayesian optimization to adaptively search for the optimal calibration data and importance estimation metrics. Experimental results show that the AdaPruner outperforms existing structured pruning methods on a family of LLMs with varying pruning ratios, demonstrating its applicability and robustness. Remarkably, at a 20\% pruning ratio, the model pruned with AdaPruner maintains 97\% of the performance of the unpruned model.</description>

      <title>MSConv: Multiplicative and Subtractive Convolution for Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Neural Networks, there are various methods of feature fusion. Different strategies can significantly affect the effectiveness of feature representation, consequently influencing the ability of model to extract representative and discriminative features. In the field of face recognition, traditional feature fusion methods include feature concatenation and feature addition. Recently, various attention mechanism-based fusion strategies have emerged. However, we found that these methods primarily focus on the important features in the image, referred to as salient features in this paper, while neglecting another equally important set of features for image recognition tasks, which we term differential features. This may cause the model to overlook critical local differences when dealing with complex facial samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient convolution module called MSConv (Multiplicative and Subtractive Convolution), designed to balance the learning of model about salient and differential features. Specifically, we employ multi-scale mixed convolution to capture both local and broader contextual information from face images, and then utilize Multiplication Operation (MO) and Subtraction Operation (SO) to extract salient and differential features, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating both salient and differential features, MSConv outperforms models that only focus on salient features.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environments: A Systematic Literature Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is reshaping software development, fundamentally altering how developers interact with their tools. This shift marks the emergence of Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environment (in-IDE HAX), a field that explores the evolving dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction in AI-assisted coding environments. Despite rapid adoption, research on in-IDE HAX remains fragmented which highlights the need for a unified overview of current practices, challenges, and opportunities. To provide a structured overview of existing research, we conduct a systematic literature review of 89 studies, summarizing current findings and outlining areas for further investigation.
  Our findings reveal that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead, automation bias, and over-reliance, particularly among novice developers. Furthermore, concerns about code correctness, security, and maintainability highlight the urgent need for explainability, verification mechanisms, and adaptive user control. Although recent advances have driven the field forward, significant research gaps remain, including a lack of longitudinal studies, personalization strategies, and AI governance frameworks. This review provides a foundation for advancing in-IDE HAX research and offers guidance for responsibly integrating AI into software development.</description>

      <title>Explainable Synthetic Image Detection through Diffusion Timestep Ensembling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we reveal that natural and synthetic images exhibit distinct differences in the high-frequency domains of their Fourier power spectra after undergoing iterative noise perturbations through an inverse multi-step denoising process, suggesting that such noise can provide additional discriminative information for identifying synthetic images. Based on this observation, we propose a novel detection method that amplifies these differences by progressively adding noise to the original images across multiple timesteps, and train an ensemble of classifiers on these noised images. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce an explanation generation and refinement module to identify flaws located in AI-generated images. Additionally, we construct two new datasets, GenHard and GenExplain, derived from the GenImage benchmark, providing detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and harder samples, increasing a minimal of 2.51% and 3.46% compared to baselines. Furthermore, our method also generalizes effectively to images generated by other diffusion models. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>CUPCase: Clinically Uncommon Patient Cases and Diagnoses Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical benchmark datasets significantly contribute to developing Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical knowledge extraction, diagnosis, summarization, and other uses. Yet, current benchmarks are mainly derived from exam questions given to medical students or cases described in the medical literature, lacking the complexity of real-world patient cases that deviate from classic textbook abstractions. These include rare diseases, uncommon presentations of common diseases, and unexpected treatment responses. Here, we construct Clinically Uncommon Patient Cases and Diagnosis Dataset (CUPCase) based on 3,562 real-world case reports from BMC, including diagnoses in open-ended textual format and as multiple-choice options with distractors. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general-purpose and Clinical LLMs, to identify and correctly diagnose a patient case, and test models' performance when only partial information about cases is available. Our findings show that general-purpose GPT-4o attains the best performance in both the multiple-choice task (average accuracy of 87.9%) and the open-ended task (BERTScore F1 of 0.764), outperforming several LLMs with a focus on the medical domain such as Meditron-70B and MedLM-Large. Moreover, GPT-4o was able to maintain 87% and 88% of its performance with only the first 20% of tokens of the case presentation in multiple-choice and free text, respectively, highlighting the potential of LLMs to aid in early diagnosis in real-world cases. CUPCase expands our ability to evaluate LLMs for clinical decision support in an open and reproducible manner.</description>

      <title>Distributed Graph Neural Network Inference With Just-In-Time Compilation For Industry-Scale Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have delivered remarkable results in various fields. However, the rapid increase in the scale of graph data has introduced significant performance bottlenecks for GNN inference. Both computational complexity and memory usage have risen dramatically, with memory becoming a critical limitation. Although graph sampling-based subgraph learning methods can help mitigate computational and memory demands, they come with drawbacks such as information loss and high redundant computation among subgraphs. This paper introduces an innovative processing paradgim for distributed graph learning that abstracts GNNs with a new set of programming interfaces and leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to its full potential. This paradigm enables GNNs to highly exploit the computational resources of distributed clusters by eliminating the drawbacks of subgraph learning methods, leading to a more efficient inference process. Our experimental results demonstrate that on industry-scale graphs of up to \textbf{500 million nodes and 22.4 billion edges}, our method can produce a performance boost of up to \textbf{27.4 times}.</description>

      <title>Text-Speech Language Models with Improved Cross-Modal Transfer by Aligning Abstraction Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- aim to enable cross-modal knowledge transfer to overcome the scaling limitations of unimodal speech LMs. The predominant approach to TSLM training expands the vocabulary of a pre-trained text LM by appending new embeddings and linear projections for speech, followed by fine-tuning on speech data. We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.</description>

      <title>GraphGen+: Advancing Distributed Subgraph Generation and Graph Learning On Industrial Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based computations are crucial in a wide range of applications, where graphs can scale to trillions of edges. To enable efficient training on such large graphs, mini-batch subgraph sampling is commonly used, which allows training without loading the entire graph into memory. However, existing solutions face significant trade-offs: online subgraph generation, as seen in frameworks like DGL and PyG, is limited to a single machine, resulting in severe performance bottlenecks, while offline precomputed subgraphs, as in GraphGen, improve sampling efficiency but introduce large storage overhead and high I/O costs during training. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GraphGen+}, an integrated framework that synchronizes distributed subgraph generation with in-memory graph learning, eliminating the need for external storage while significantly improving efficiency. GraphGen+ achieves a \textbf{27$\times$} speedup in subgraph generation compared to conventional SQL-like methods and a \textbf{1.3$\times$} speedup over GraphGen, supporting training on 1 million nodes per iteration and removing the overhead associated with precomputed subgraphs, making it a scalable and practical solution for industry-scale graph learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Frank, a human-in-the-loop system for co-evolutionary hybrid decision-making aiding the user to label records from an un-labeled dataset. Frank employs incremental learning to ``evolve'' in parallel with the user's decisions, by training an interpretable machine learning model on the records labeled by the user. Furthermore, Frank advances state-of-the-art approaches by offering inconsistency controls, explanations, fairness checks, and bad-faith safeguards simultaneously. We evaluate our proposal by simulating the users' behavior with various levels of expertise and reliance on Frank's suggestions. The experiments show that Frank's intervention leads to improvements in the accuracy and the fairness of the decisions.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for recommender systems. Existing LLM-based recommender systems take two different approaches for representing items in natural language, i.e., Attribute-based Representation and Description-based Representation. In this work, we aim to address the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness that these two approaches encounter, when representing items consumed by users. Based on our interesting observation that there is a significant information overlap between images and descriptions associated with items, we propose a novel method, Image is all you need for LLM-based Recommender system (I-LLMRec). Our main idea is to leverage images as an alternative to lengthy textual descriptions for representing items, aiming at reducing token usage while preserving the rich semantic information of item descriptions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that I-LLMRec outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging images. Moreover, a further appeal of I-LLMRec is its ability to reduce sensitivity to noise in descriptions, leading to more robust recommendations.</description>

      <title>Infant Cry Detection Using Causal Temporal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a major challenge in acoustic event detection, in particular infant cry detection in the presence of other sounds and background noises: the lack of precise annotated data. We present two contributions for supervised and unsupervised infant cry detection. The first is an annotated dataset for cry segmentation, which enables supervised models to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a novel unsupervised method, Causal Representation Spare Transition Clustering (CRSTC), based on causal temporal representation, which helps address the issue of data scarcity more generally. By integrating the detected cry segments, we significantly improve the performance of downstream infant cry classification, highlighting the potential of this approach for infant care applications.</description>

      <title>Can Atomic Step Decomposition Enhance the Self-structured Reasoning of Multimodal Large Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the ability of "slow thinking" into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that different levels of reasoning abilities can be combined dynamically to tackle questions with different complexity. To this end, we propose a paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which is composed of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomenon of overthinking. To introduce structured reasoning capabilities into visual understanding models, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is now public available in https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.</description>

      <title>From Captions to Rewards (CAREVL): Leveraging Large Language Model Experts for Enhanced Reward Modeling in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large vision-language models (LVLMs) with human preferences is challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained, high-quality, and multimodal preference data without human annotations. Existing methods relying on direct distillation often struggle with low-confidence data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose CAREVL, a novel method for preference reward modeling by reliably using both high- and low-confidence data. First, a cluster of auxiliary expert models (textual reward models) innovatively leverages image captions as weak supervision signals to filter high-confidence data. The high-confidence data are then used to fine-tune the LVLM. Second, low-confidence data are used to generate diverse preference samples using the fine-tuned LVLM. These samples are then scored and selected to construct reliable chosen-rejected pairs for further training. CAREVL achieves performance improvements over traditional distillation-based methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Critical Foreign Policy Decisions (CFPD)-Benchmark: Measuring Diplomatic Preferences in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As national security institutions increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decision-making and content generation processes, understanding the inherent biases of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. This study presents a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the biases and preferences of seven prominent foundation models-Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002, Mixtral 8x22B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Qwen2 72B-in the context of international relations (IR). We designed a bias discovery study around core topics in IR using 400-expert crafted scenarios to analyze results from our selected models. These scenarios focused on four topical domains including: military escalation, military and humanitarian intervention, cooperative behavior in the international system, and alliance dynamics. Our analysis reveals noteworthy variation among model recommendations based on scenarios designed for the four tested domains. Particularly, Qwen2 72B, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct models offered significantly more escalatory recommendations than Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models. All models exhibit some degree of country-specific biases, often recommending less escalatory and interventionist actions for China and Russia compared to the United States and the United Kingdom. These findings highlight the necessity for controlled deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments, emphasizing the need for domain-specific evaluations and model fine-tuning to align with institutional objectives.</description>

      <title>Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at https://github.com/Sckathach/subspace-rerouting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview on how to develop a dense and deep neural network for making a time series prediction. First, the history and cornerstones in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be presented. After a short introduction to the theory of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the paper will go deeper into the techniques for conducting a time series prediction with different models of neural networks. For this project, Python's development environment Jupyter, extended with the TensorFlow package and deep-learning application Keras is used. The system setup and project framework are explained in more detail before discussing the time series prediction. The main part shows an applied example of time series prediction with weather data. For this work, a deep recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory cells is used to conduct the time series prediction. The results and evaluation of the work show that a weather prediction with deep neural networks can be successful for a short time period. However, there are some drawbacks and limitations with time series prediction, which will be discussed towards the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Your Large Vision-Language Model Only Needs A Few Attention Heads For Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding seeks to localize the image region corresponding to a free-form text description. Recently, the strong multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven substantial improvements in visual grounding, though they inevitably require fine-tuning and additional model components to explicitly generate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. However, we discover that a few attention heads in frozen LVLMs demonstrate strong visual grounding capabilities. We refer to these heads, which consistently capture object locations related to text semantics, as localization heads. Using localization heads, we introduce a straightforward and effective training-free visual grounding framework that utilizes text-to-image attention maps from localization heads to identify the target objects. Surprisingly, only three out of thousands of attention heads are sufficient to achieve competitive localization performance compared to existing LVLM-based visual grounding methods that require fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that LVLMs can innately ground objects based on a deep comprehension of the text-image relationship, as they implicitly focus on relevant image regions to generate informative text outputs. All the source codes will be made available to the public.</description>

      <title>Single Domain Generalization with Adversarial Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can generalize to unseen testing domains by leveraging data from multiple training domains. However, traditional DG methods rely on the availability of multiple diverse training domains, limiting their applicability in data-constrained scenarios. Single Domain Generalization (SDG) addresses the more realistic and challenging setting by restricting the training data to a single domain distribution. The main challenges in SDG stem from the limited diversity of training data and the inaccessibility of unseen testing data distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single domain generalization method that leverages an adversarial memory bank to augment training features. Our memory-based feature augmentation network maps both training and testing features into an invariant subspace spanned by diverse memory features, implicitly aligning the training and testing domains in the projected space. To maintain a diverse and representative feature memory bank, we introduce an adversarial feature generation method that creates features extending beyond the training domain distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard single domain generalization benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Synergizing AI and Digital Twins for Next-Generation Network Optimization, Forecasting, and Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital network twins (DNTs) are virtual representations of physical networks, designed to enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of network performance. When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address critical challenges in 6G networks. We highlight key technical challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring network reliability, achieving joint data-scenario forecasting, and maintaining security in high-risk environments. Additionally, we propose several pipelines that integrate DNT and ML within coherent frameworks to enhance network optimization and security. Case studies demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed pipelines in edge caching and vehicular networks. In edge caching, the pipeline achieves over 80% cache hit rates while balancing base station loads. In autonomous vehicular system, it ensure a 100% no-collision rate, showcasing its reliability in safety-critical scenarios. By exploring these synergies, we offer insights into the future of intelligent and adaptive network systems that automate decision-making and problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Advancing Autonomous Vehicle Intelligence: Deep Learning and Multimodal LLM for Traffic Sign Recognition and Robust Lane Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require reliable traffic sign recognition and robust lane detection capabilities to ensure safe navigation in complex and dynamic environments. This paper introduces an integrated approach combining advanced deep learning techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for comprehensive road perception. For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%). The proposed comprehensive framework markedly enhances AV perception reliability, thus contributing significantly to safer autonomous driving across diverse and challenging road scenarios.</description>

Abstract: It is known for some time that autocorrelations of words in human-written texts decay according to a power law. Recent works have also shown that the autocorrelations decay in texts generated by LLMs is qualitatively different from the literary texts. Solid state physics tie the autocorrelations decay laws to the states of matter. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, depending on the temperature parameter, LLMs can generate text that can be classified as solid, critical state or gas.</description>

      <title>Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code, trained models and data are accessible at https://github.com/francelico/deac-rep.</description>

      <title>The AI Pentad, the CHARME$^{2}$D Model, and an Assessment of Current-State AI Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in the past few years with AI-enabled applications beginning to permeate every aspect of our society. Despite the widespread consensus on the need to regulate AI, there remains a lack of a unified approach to framing, developing, and assessing AI regulations. Many of the existing methods take a value-based approach, for example, accountability, fairness, free from bias, transparency, and trust. However, these methods often face challenges at the outset due to disagreements in academia over the subjective nature of these definitions. This paper aims to establish a unifying model for AI regulation from the perspective of core AI components. We first introduce the AI Pentad, which comprises the five essential components of AI: humans and organizations, algorithms, data, computing, and energy. We then review AI regulatory enablers, including AI registration and disclosure, AI monitoring, and AI enforcement mechanisms. Subsequently, we present the CHARME$^{2}$D Model to explore further the relationship between the AI Pentad and AI regulatory enablers. Finally, we apply the CHARME$^{2}$D model to assess AI regulatory efforts in the European Union (EU), China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps. This comparative evaluation offers insights for future legislative work in the AI domain.</description>

Abstract: With recent dramatic increases in AI system capabilities, there has been growing interest in utilizing machine learning for reasoning-heavy, quantitative tasks, particularly mathematics. While there are many resources capturing mathematics at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate level, there are far fewer resources available that align with the level of difficulty and open endedness encountered by professional mathematicians working on open problems. To address this, we introduce a new collection of datasets, the Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo), representing either foundational results or open problems in algebraic combinatorics, a subfield of mathematics that studies discrete structures arising from abstract algebra. Further differentiating our dataset collection is the fact that it aims at the conjecturing process. Each dataset includes an open-ended research-level question and a large collection of examples (up to 10M in some cases) from which conjectures should be generated. We describe all nine datasets, the different ways machine learning models can be applied to them (e.g., training with narrow models followed by interpretability analysis or program synthesis with LLMs), and discuss some of the challenges involved in designing datasets like these.</description>

      <title>VORTEX: Challenging CNNs at Texture Recognition by using Vision Transformers with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Texture recognition has recently been dominated by ImageNet-pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with specialized modifications and feature engineering required to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, although Vision Transformers (ViTs) were introduced a few years ago, little is known about their texture recognition ability. Therefore, in this work, we introduce VORTEX (ViTs with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings for Texture Recognition), a novel method that enables the effective use of ViTs for texture analysis. VORTEX extracts multi-depth token embeddings from pre-trained ViT backbones and employs a lightweight module to aggregate hierarchical features and perform orderless encoding, obtaining a better image representation for texture recognition tasks. This approach allows seamless integration with any ViT with the common transformer architecture. Moreover, no fine-tuning of the backbone is performed, since they are used only as frozen feature extractors, and the features are fed to a linear SVM. We evaluate VORTEX on nine diverse texture datasets, demonstrating its ability to achieve or surpass SOTA performance in a variety of texture analysis scenarios. By bridging the gap between texture recognition with CNNs and transformer-based architectures, VORTEX paves the way for adopting emerging transformer foundation models. Furthermore, VORTEX demonstrates robust computational efficiency when coupled with ViT backbones compared to CNNs with similar costs. The method implementation and experimental scripts are publicly available in our online repository.</description>

      <title>EPR-GAIL: An EPR-Enhanced Hierarchical Imitation Learning Framework to Simulate Complex User Consumption Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User consumption behavior data, which records individuals' online spending history at various types of stores, has been widely used in various applications, such as store recommendation, site selection, and sale forecasting. However, its high worth is limited due to deficiencies in data comprehensiveness and changes of application scenarios. Thus, generating high-quality sequential consumption data by simulating complex user consumption behaviors is of great importance to real-world applications. Two branches of existing sequence generation methods are both limited in quality. Model-based methods with simplified assumptions fail to model the complex decision process of user consumption, while data-driven methods that emulate real-world data are prone to noises, unobserved behaviors, and dynamic decision space. In this work, we propose to enhance the fidelity and trustworthiness of the data-driven Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) method by blending it with the Exploration and Preferential Return EPR model . The core idea of our EPR-GAIL framework is to model user consumption behaviors as a complex EPR decision process, which consists of purchase, exploration, and preference decisions. Specifically, we design the hierarchical policy function in the generator as a realization of the EPR decision process and employ the probability distributions of the EPR model to guide the reward function in the discriminator. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of user consumption behaviors on an online platform demonstrate that the EPR-GAIL framework outperforms the best state-of-the-art baseline by over 19\% in terms of data fidelity. Furthermore, the generated consumption behavior data can improve the performance of sale prediction and location recommendation by up to 35.29% and 11.19%, respectively, validating its advantage for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Causality Enhanced Origin-Destination Flow Prediction in Data-Scarce Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great importance to developing cities, as it can contribute to optimize urban structures and layouts. However, with the common issues of missing regional features and lacking OD flow data, it is quite daunting to predict OD flow in developing cities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Causality-Enhanced OD Flow Prediction (CE-OFP), a unified framework that aims to transfer urban knowledge between cities and achieve accuracy improvements in OD flow predictions across data-scarce cities. In specific, we propose a novel reinforcement learning model to discover universal causalities among urban features in data-rich cities and build corresponding causal graphs. Then, we further build Causality-Enhanced Variational Auto-Encoder (CE-VAE) to incorporate causal graphs for effective feature reconstruction in data-scarce cities. Finally, with the reconstructed features, we devise a knowledge distillation method with a graph attention network to migrate the OD prediction model from data-rich cities to data-scare cities. Extensive experiments on two pairs of real-world datasets validate that the proposed CE-OFP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the RMSE of OD flow prediction for data-scarce cities by up to 11%.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Black Box: Integrating Moral Imagination with Technical AI Governance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the intricate interplay among AI safety, security, and governance by integrating technical systems engineering with principles of moral imagination and ethical philosophy. Drawing on foundational insights from Weapons of Math Destruction and Thinking in Systems alongside contemporary debates in AI ethics, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework designed to regulate AI technologies deployed in high-stakes domains such as defense, finance, healthcare, and education. Our approach combines rigorous technical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to expose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed case studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level Grading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification, and lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine public trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI resilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols, and interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in ethical and technical AI governance.</description>

      <title>Swift Hydra: Self-Reinforcing Generative Framework for Anomaly Detection with Multiple Mamba Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, and its integration into complex product modeling and simulation code generation can significantly enhance the efficiency of the system design phase in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In this study, we introduce a generative system design methodology framework for MBSE, offering a practical approach for the intelligent generation of simulation models for system physical properties. First, we employ inference techniques, generative models, and integrated modeling and simulation languages to construct simulation models for system physical properties based on product design documents. Subsequently, we fine-tune the language model used for simulation model generation on an existing library of simulation models and additional datasets generated through generative modeling. Finally, we introduce evaluation metrics for the generated simulation models for system physical properties. Our proposed approach to simulation model generation presents the innovative concept of scalable templates for simulation models. Using these templates, GenAI generates simulation models for system physical properties through code completion. The experimental results demonstrate that, for mainstream open-source Transformer-based models, the quality of the simulation model is significantly improved using the simulation model generation method proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training Meta-Rule Selection Policy for Visual Generative Abductive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded neural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after learning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction, boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

      <title>Graph Retrieval-Augmented LLM for Conversational Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm for offering personalized recommendations through natural language dialogue. However, they face challenges with knowledge sparsity, as users often provide brief, incomplete preference statements. While recent methods have integrated external knowledge sources to mitigate this, they still struggle with semantic understanding and complex preference reasoning. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, showing significant potential for CRSs. Nevertheless, due to the lack of domain knowledge, existing LLM-based CRSs either produce hallucinated recommendations or demand expensive domain-specific training, which largely limits their applicability. In this work, we present G-CRS (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model for Conversational Recommender Systems), a novel training-free framework that combines graph retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning to enhance LLMs' recommendation capabilities. Specifically, G-CRS employs a two-stage retrieve-and-recommend architecture, where a GNN-based graph reasoner first identifies candidate items, followed by Personalized PageRank exploration to jointly discover potential items and similar user interactions. These retrieved contexts are then transformed into structured prompts for LLM reasoning, enabling contextually grounded recommendations without task-specific training. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that G-CRS achieves superior recommendation performance compared to existing methods without requiring task-specific training.</description>

      <title>Seesaw: High-throughput LLM Inference via Model Re-sharding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve the efficiency of distributed large language model (LLM) inference, various parallelization strategies, such as tensor and pipeline parallelism, have been proposed. However, the distinct computational characteristics inherent in the two stages of LLM inference-prefilling and decoding-render a single static parallelization strategy insufficient for the effective optimization of both stages. In this work, we present Seesaw, an LLM inference engine optimized for throughput-oriented tasks. The key idea behind Seesaw is dynamic model re-sharding, a technique that facilitates the dynamic reconfiguration of parallelization strategies across stages, thereby maximizing throughput at both phases. To mitigate re-sharding overhead and optimize computational efficiency, we employ tiered KV cache buffering and transition-minimizing scheduling. These approaches work synergistically to reduce the overhead caused by frequent stage transitions while ensuring maximum batching efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Seesaw achieves a throughput increase of up to 1.78x (1.36x on average) compared to vLLM, the most widely used state-of-the-art LLM inference engine.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Enhanced Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity prediction is crucial for mitigating storm hazards, yet its complex dynamics pose challenges to traditional methods. Here, we introduce a Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PIR-NODE) model to precisely forecast TC intensity evolution. This model leverages the powerful non-linear fitting capabilities of deep learning, integrates residual connections to enhance model depth and training stability, and explicitly models the continuous temporal evolution of TC intensity using Neural ODEs. Experimental results in the SHIPS dataset demonstrate that the PIR-NODE model achieves a significant improvement in 24-hour intensity prediction accuracy compared to traditional statistical models and benchmark deep learning methods, with a 25. 2\% reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) and a 19.5\% increase in R-square (R2) relative to a baseline of neural network. Crucially, the residual structure effectively preserves initial state information, and the model exhibits robust generalization capabilities. This study details the PIR-NODE model architecture, physics-informed integration strategies, and comprehensive experimental validation, revealing the substantial potential of deep learning techniques in predicting complex geophysical systems and laying the foundation for future refined TC forecasting research.</description>

      <title>CtrTab: Tabular Data Synthesis with High-Dimensional and Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results. However, we observe that when the data dimensionality increases, existing models tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler, non-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in high-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the distribution accurately. To address this issue, we propose CtrTab-a condition controlled diffusion model for tabular data synthesis-to improve the performance of diffusion-based generative models in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios. Through CtrTab, we inject samples with added Laplace noise as control signals to improve data diversity and show its resemblance to L2 regularization, which enhances model robustness. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with performance gap in accuracy over 80% on average. Our source code will be released upon paper publication.</description>

      <title>Geometric Knowledge-Guided Localized Global Distribution Alignment for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity in federated learning, characterized by a significant misalignment between local and global distributions, leads to divergent local optimization directions and hinders global model training. Existing studies mainly focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation, but these indirect approaches demonstrate instability when handling highly heterogeneous data distributions, especially in scenarios where label skew and domain skew coexist. To address this, we propose a geometry-guided data generation method that centers on simulating the global embedding distribution locally. We first introduce the concept of the geometric shape of an embedding distribution and then address the challenge of obtaining global geometric shapes under privacy constraints. Subsequently, we propose GGEUR, which leverages global geometric shapes to guide the generation of new samples, enabling a closer approximation to the ideal global distribution. In single-domain scenarios, we augment samples based on global geometric shapes to enhance model generalization; in multi-domain scenarios, we further employ class prototypes to simulate the global distribution across domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing approaches in handling highly heterogeneous data, including scenarios with label skew, domain skew, and their coexistence.

      <description>arXiv:2503.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction coupled with neural rendering techniques have greatly improved the creation of photo-realistic 3D scenes, influencing both academic research and industry applications. The technique of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its variants incorporate the strengths of both primitive-based and volumetric representations, achieving superior rendering quality. While 3D Geometric Scattering (3DGS) and its variants have advanced the field of 3D representation, they fall short in capturing the stochastic properties of non-local structural information during the training process. Additionally, the initialisation of spherical functions in 3DGS-based methods often fails to engage higher-order terms in early training rounds, leading to unnecessary computational overhead as training progresses. Furthermore, current 3DGS-based approaches require training on higher resolution images to render higher resolution outputs, significantly increasing memory demands and prolonging training durations. We introduce StructGS, a framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved novel-view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. StructGS innovatively incorporates a patch-based SSIM loss, dynamic spherical harmonics initialisation and a Multi-scale Residual Network (MSRN) to address the above-mentioned limitations, respectively. Our framework significantly reduces computational redundancy, enhances detail capture and supports high-resolution rendering from low-resolution inputs. Experimentally, StructGS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving higher quality and more detailed renderings with fewer artifacts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Layer Attention Efficiency through Pruning Redundant Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.</description>

      <title>HuixiangDou2: A Robustly Optimized GraphRAG Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on familiar queries but struggle with specialized or emerging topics. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. Evaluating retrieval effectiveness is also challenging due to dataset overlap with LLM pretraining data. In this work, we introduce HuixiangDou2, a robustly optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we leverage the effectiveness of dual-level retrieval and optimize its performance in a 32k context for maximum precision, and compare logic-based retrieval and dual-level retrieval to enhance overall functionality. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on a test set, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. With our approach, the score improved significantly from 60 to 74.5, as illustrated in the Figure. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic-form retrieval improves structured reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage verification mechanism to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. Empirical results show significant accuracy gains over baselines, highlighting the importance of adaptive retrieval. To support research and adoption, we release HuixiangDou2 as an open-source resource https://github.com/tpoisonooo/huixiangdou2.</description>

      <title>PDB: Not All Drivers Are the Same -- A Personalized Dataset for Understanding Driving Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving behavior is inherently personal, influenced by individual habits, decision-making styles, and physiological states. However, most existing datasets treat all drivers as homogeneous, overlooking driver-specific variability. To address this gap, we introduce the Personalized Driving Behavior (PDB) dataset, a multi-modal dataset designed to capture personalization in driving behavior under naturalistic driving conditions. Unlike conventional datasets, PDB minimizes external influences by maintaining consistent routes, vehicles, and lighting conditions across sessions. It includes sources from 128-line LiDAR, front-facing camera video, GNSS, 9-axis IMU, CAN bus data (throttle, brake, steering angle), and driver-specific signals such as facial video and heart rate. The dataset features 12 participants, approximately 270,000 LiDAR frames, 1.6 million images, and 6.6 TB of raw sensor data. The processed trajectory dataset consists of 1,669 segments, each spanning 10 seconds with a 0.2-second interval. By explicitly capturing drivers' behavior, PDB serves as a unique resource for human factor analysis, driver identification, and personalized mobility applications, contributing to the development of human-centric intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Sign Language Translation using Frame and Event Stream: Benchmark Dataset and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate sign language understanding serves as a crucial communication channel for individuals with disabilities. Current sign language translation algorithms predominantly rely on RGB frames, which may be limited by fixed frame rates, variable lighting conditions, and motion blur caused by rapid hand movements. Inspired by the recent successful application of event cameras in other fields, we propose to leverage event streams to assist RGB cameras in capturing gesture data, addressing the various challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale RGB-Event sign language translation dataset using the DVS346 camera, termed VECSL, which contains 15,676 RGB-Event samples, 15,191 glosses, and covers 2,568 Chinese characters. These samples were gathered across a diverse range of indoor and outdoor environments, capturing multiple viewing angles, varying light intensities, and different camera motions. Due to the absence of benchmark algorithms for comparison in this new task, we retrained and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art SLT algorithms, and believe that this benchmark can effectively support subsequent related research. Additionally, we propose a novel RGB-Event sign language translation framework (i.e., M$^2$-SLT) that incorporates fine-grained micro-sign and coarse-grained macro-sign retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results on the proposed dataset. Both the source code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL.</description>

      <title>PerturboLLaVA: Reducing Multimodal Hallucinations with Perturbative Visual Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) particularly for dense image captioning tasks. To tackle the challenge, we identify the current lack of a metric that finely measures the caption quality in concept level. We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Safety Cognition Capability in Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the safety of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving is particularly important; however, existing work mainly focuses on traditional benchmark evaluations. As interactive components within autonomous driving systems, VLMs must maintain strong safety cognition during interactions. From this perspective, we propose a novel evaluation method: Safety Cognitive Driving Benchmark (SCD-Bench) . To address the large-scale annotation challenge for SCD-Bench, we develop the Autonomous Driving Image-Text Annotation System (ADA) . Additionally, to ensure data quality in SCD-Bench, our dataset undergoes manual refinement by experts with professional knowledge in autonomous driving. We further develop an automated evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs). To verify its effectiveness, we compare its evaluation results with those of expert human evaluations, achieving a consistency rate of 99.74%. Preliminary experimental results indicate that existing open-source models still lack sufficient safety cognition, showing a significant gap compared to GPT-4o. Notably, lightweight models (1B-4B) demonstrate minimal safety cognition. However, since lightweight models are crucial for autonomous driving systems, this presents a significant challenge for integrating VLMs into the field.</description>

      <title>ExGes: Expressive Human Motion Retrieval and Modulation for Audio-Driven Gesture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven human gesture synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications in virtual avatars, human-computer interaction, and creative content generation. Despite notable progress, existing methods often produce gestures that are coarse, lack expressiveness, and fail to fully align with audio semantics. To address these challenges, we propose ExGes, a novel retrieval-enhanced diffusion framework with three key designs: (1) a Motion Base Construction, which builds a gesture library using training dataset; (2) a Motion Retrieval Module, employing constrative learning and momentum distillation for fine-grained reference poses retreiving; and (3) a Precision Control Module, integrating partial masking and stochastic masking to enable flexible and fine-grained control. Experimental evaluations on BEAT2 demonstrate that ExGes reduces Fr\'echet Gesture Distance by 6.2\% and improves motion diversity by 5.3\% over EMAGE, with user studies revealing a 71.3\% preference for its naturalness and semantic relevance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>DynamicID: Zero-Shot Multi-ID Image Personalization with Flexible Facial Editability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.</description>

      <title>A Light and Tuning-free Method for Simulating Camera Motion in Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>HFedCKD: Toward Robust Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Data-free Knowledge Distillation and Two-way Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current federated learning frameworks are modeled as static processes, ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the learning system. Under the limited communication budget of the central server, the flexible model architecture of a large number of clients participating in knowledge transfer requires a lower participation rate, active clients have uneven contributions, and the client scale seriously hinders the performance of FL. We consider a more general and practical federation scenario and propose a system heterogeneous federation method based on data-free knowledge distillation and two-way contrast (HFedCKD). We apply the Inverse Probability Weighted Distillation (IPWD) strategy to the data-free knowledge transfer framework. The generator completes the data features of the nonparticipating clients. IPWD implements a dynamic evaluation of the prediction contribution of each client under different data distributions. Based on the antibiased weighting of its prediction loss, the weight distribution of each client is effectively adjusted to fairly integrate the knowledge of participating clients. At the same time, the local model is split into a feature extractor and a classifier. Through differential contrast learning, the feature extractor is aligned with the global model in the feature space, while the classifier maintains personalized decision-making capabilities. HFedCKD effectively alleviates the knowledge offset caused by a low participation rate under data-free knowledge distillation and improves the performance and stability of the model. We conduct extensive experiments on image and IoT datasets to comprehensively evaluate and verify the generalization and robustness of the proposed HFedCKD framework.</description>

      <title>GFlowVLM: Enhancing Multi-step Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Generative Flow Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However, common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards. These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks (ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Superior Quantization Accuracy: A Layer-sensitive Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models have exhibited remarkable human-like intelligence in tasks such as natural language comprehension, problem-solving, logical reasoning, and knowledge retrieval. However, training and serving these models require substantial computational resources, posing a significant barrier to their widespread application and further research. To mitigate this challenge, various model compression techniques have been developed to reduce computational requirements. Nevertheless, existing methods often employ uniform quantization configurations, failing to account for the varying difficulties across different layers in quantizing large neural network models. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging layer-sensitivity features, such as activation sensitivity and weight distribution Kurtosis, to identify layers that are challenging to quantize accurately and allocate additional memory budget. The proposed methods, named SensiBoost and KurtBoost, respectively, demonstrate notable improvement in quantization accuracy, achieving up to 9% lower perplexity with only a 2% increase in memory budget on LLama models compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Can Small Language Models Reliably Resist Jailbreak Attacks? A Comprehensive Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to large language models (LLMs) due to their low computational demands, enhanced privacy guarantees and comparable performance in specific domains through light-weight fine-tuning. Deploying SLMs on edge devices, such as smartphones and smart vehicles, has become a growing trend. However, the security implications of SLMs have received less attention than LLMs, particularly regarding jailbreak attacks, which is recognized as one of the top threats of LLMs by the OWASP. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of SLMs' vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Through systematically evaluation on 63 SLMs from 15 mainstream SLM families against 8 state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, we demonstrate that 47.6% of evaluated SLMs show high susceptibility to jailbreak attacks (ASR &gt; 40%) and 38.1% of them can not even resist direct harmful query (ASR &gt; 50%). We further analyze the reasons behind the vulnerabilities and identify four key factors: model size, model architecture, training datasets and training techniques. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of three prompt-level defense methods and find that none of them achieve perfect performance, with detection accuracy varying across different SLMs and attack methods. Notably, we point out that the inherent security awareness play a critical role in SLM security, and models with strong security awareness could timely terminate unsafe response with little reminder. Building upon the findings, we highlight the urgent need for security-by-design approaches in SLM development and provide valuable insights for building more trustworthy SLM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as Digital Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is frequently portrayed as revolutionary or even apocalyptic, prompting calls for novel regulatory approaches. This essay argues that such views are misguided. Instead, generative AI should be understood as an evolutionary step in the broader algorithmic media landscape, alongside search engines and social media. Like these platforms, generative AI centralizes information control, relies on complex algorithms to shape content, and extensively uses user data, thus perpetuating common problems: unchecked corporate power, echo chambers, and weakened traditional gatekeepers. Regulation should therefore share a consistent objective: ensuring media institutions remain trustworthy. Without trust, public discourse risks fragmenting into isolated communities dominated by comforting, tribal beliefs -- a threat intensified by generative AI's capacity to bypass gatekeepers and personalize truth. Current governance frameworks, such as the EU's AI Act and the US Executive Order 14110, emphasize reactive risk mitigation, addressing measurable threats like national security, public health, and algorithmic bias. While effective for novel technological risks, this reactive approach fails to adequately address broader issues of trust and legitimacy inherent to digital media. Proactive regulation fostering transparency, accountability, and public confidence is essential. Viewing generative AI exclusively as revolutionary risks repeating past regulatory failures that left social media and search engines insufficiently regulated. Instead, regulation must proactively shape an algorithmic media environment serving the public good, supporting quality information and robust civic discourse.</description>

      <title>From Motion Signals to Insights: A Unified Framework for Student Behavior Analysis and Feedback in Physical Education Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing student behavior in educational scenarios is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and student engagement. Existing AI-based models often rely on classroom video footage to identify and analyze student behavior. While these video-based methods can partially capture and analyze student actions, they struggle to accurately track each student's actions in physical education classes, which take place in outdoor, open spaces with diverse activities, and are challenging to generalize to the specialized technical movements involved in these settings. Furthermore, current methods typically lack the ability to integrate specialized pedagogical knowledge, limiting their ability to provide in-depth insights into student behavior and offer feedback for optimizing instructional design. To address these limitations, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that leverages human activity recognition technologies based on motion signals, combined with advanced large language models, to conduct more detailed analyses and feedback of student behavior in physical education classes. Our framework begins with the teacher's instructional designs and the motion signals from students during physical education sessions, ultimately generating automated reports with teaching insights and suggestions for improving both learning and class instructions. This solution provides a motion signal-based approach for analyzing student behavior and optimizing instructional design tailored to physical education classes. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can accurately identify student behaviors and produce meaningful pedagogical insights.</description>

      <title>AnywhereDoor: Multi-Target Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</description>

      <title>ARMOR v0.1: Empowering Autoregressive Multimodal Understanding Model with Interleaved Multimodal Generation via Asymmetric Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified models (UniMs) for multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate" algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon at https://armor.github.io.</description>

      <title>LSA: Latent Style Augmentation Towards Stain-Agnostic Cervical Cancer Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of computer-aided diagnosis systems for cervical cancer screening using whole slide images (WSIs) faces critical challenges due to domain shifts caused by staining variations across different scanners and imaging environments. While existing stain augmentation methods improve patch-level robustness, they fail to scale to WSIs due to two key limitations: (1) inconsistent stain patterns when extending patch operations to gigapixel slides, and (2) prohibitive computational/storage costs from offline processing of augmented WSIs.To address this, we propose Latent Style Augmentation (LSA), a framework that performs efficient, online stain augmentation directly on WSI-level latent features. We first introduce WSAug, a WSI-level stain augmentation method ensuring consistent stain across patches within a WSI. Using offline-augmented WSIs by WSAug, we design and train Stain Transformer, which can simulate targeted style in the latent space, efficiently enhancing the robustness of the WSI-level classifier. We validate our method on a multi-scanner WSI dataset for cervical cancer diagnosis. Despite being trained on data from a single scanner, our approach achieves significant performance improvements on out-of-distribution data from other scanners. Code will be available at https://github.com/caijd2000/LSA.</description>

      <title>Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.</description>

      <title>Conceptrol: Concept Control of Zero-shot Personalized Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized image generation with text-to-image diffusion models generates unseen images based on reference image content. Zero-shot adapter methods such as IP-Adapter and OminiControl are especially interesting because they do not require test-time fine-tuning. However, they struggle to balance preserving personalized content and adherence to the text prompt. We identify a critical design flaw resulting in this performance gap: current adapters inadequately integrate personalization images with the textual descriptions. The generated images, therefore, replicate the personalized content rather than adhere to the text prompt instructions. Yet the base text-to-image has strong conceptual understanding capabilities that can be leveraged.
  We propose Conceptrol, a simple yet effective framework that enhances zero-shot adapters without adding computational overhead. Conceptrol constrains the attention of visual specification with a textual concept mask that improves subject-driven generation capabilities. It achieves as much as 89% improvement on personalization benchmarks over the vanilla IP-Adapter and can even outperform fine-tuning approaches such as Dreambooth LoRA. The source code is available at https://github.com/QY-H00/Conceptrol.</description>

      <title>SHIP: A Shapelet-based Approach for Interpretable Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common and critical issue during mechanical ventilation, affecting up to 85% of patients. PVA can result in clinical complications such as discomfort, sleep disruption, and potentially more severe conditions like ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm dysfunction. Traditional PVA management, which relies on manual adjustments by healthcare providers, is often inadequate due to delays and errors. While various computational methods, including rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to detect PVA events, they face challenges related to dataset imbalances and lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a shapelet-based approach SHIP for PVA detection, utilizing shapelets - discriminative subsequences in time-series data - to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. Our method addresses dataset imbalances through shapelet-based data augmentation and constructs a shapelet pool to transform the dataset for more effective classification. The combined shapelet and statistical features are then used in a classifier to identify PVA events. Experimental results on medical datasets show that SHIP significantly improves PVA detection while providing interpretable insights into model decisions.</description>

      <title>WildIFEval: Instruction Following in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent LLMs have shown remarkable success in following user instructions, yet handling instructions with multiple constraints remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce WildIFEval - a large-scale dataset of 12K real user instructions with diverse, multi-constraint conditions. Unlike prior datasets, our collection spans a broad lexical and topical spectrum of constraints, in natural user prompts. We categorize these constraints into eight high-level classes to capture their distribution and dynamics in real-world scenarios. Leveraging WildIFEval, we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark the instruction-following capabilities of leading LLMs. Our findings reveal that all evaluated models experience performance degradation with an increasing number of constraints. Thus, we show that all models have a large room for improvement on such tasks. Moreover, we observe that the specific type of constraint plays a critical role in model performance. We release our dataset to promote further research on instruction-following under complex, realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DiffCLIP, a novel vision-language model that extends the differential attention mechanism to CLIP architectures. Differential attention was originally developed for large language models to amplify relevant context while canceling out noisy information. In this work, we integrate this mechanism into CLIP's dual encoder (image and text) framework. With minimal additional parameters, DiffCLIP achieves superior performance on image-text understanding tasks. Across zero-shot classification, retrieval, and robustness benchmarks, DiffCLIP consistently outperforms baseline CLIP models. Notably, these gains come with negligible computational overhead, demonstrating that differential attention can significantly enhance multi-modal representations without sacrificing efficiency. Code can be found at https://github.com/hammoudhasan/DiffCLIP.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Early Detection of Sexual Predators via Turn-level Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online grooming is a severe social threat where sexual predators gradually entrap child victims with subtle and gradual manipulation. Therefore, timely intervention for online grooming is critical for proactive protection. However, previous methods fail to determine the optimal intervention points (i.e., jump to conclusions) as they rely on chat-level risk labels by causing weak supervision of risky utterances. For timely detection, we propose speed control reinforcement learning (SCoRL) (The code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/jinmyeongAN/SCoRL), incorporating a practical strategy derived from luring communication theory (LCT). To capture the predator's turn-level entrapment, we use a turn-level risk label based on the LCT. Then, we design a novel speed control reward function that balances the trade-off between speed and accuracy based on turn-level risk label; thus, SCoRL can identify the optimal intervention moment. In addition, we introduce a turn-level metric for precise evaluation, identifying limitations in previously used chat-level metrics. Experimental results show that SCoRL effectively preempted online grooming, offering a more proactive and timely solution. Further analysis reveals that our method enhances performance while intuitively identifying optimal early intervention points.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated Event-Graph Neural Networks for Low-Latency Time-Series Classification on SoC FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quantities of data recorded by embedded edge sensors grow, so too does the need for intelligent local processing. Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.</description>

      <title>BTFL: A Bayesian-based Test-Time Generalization Method for Internal and External Data Distributions in Federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively develop a global model while maintaining data privacy. However, online FL deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts and evolving test samples. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) tailors the global model to individual client distributions, but struggles with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples during testing, leading to performance degradation. In real-world scenarios, balancing personalization and generalization during online testing is crucial and existing methods primarily focus on training-phase generalization. To address the test-time trade-off, we introduce a new scenario: Test-time Generalization for Internal and External Distributions in Federated Learning (TGFL), which evaluates adaptability under Internal Distribution (IND) and External Distribution (EXD). We propose BTFL, a Bayesian-based test-time generalization method for TGFL, which balances generalization and personalization at the sample level during testing. BTFL employs a two-head architecture to store local and global knowledge, interpolating predictions via a dual-Bayesian framework that considers both historical test data and current sample characteristics with theoretical guarantee and faster speed. Our experiments demonstrate that BTFL achieves improved performance across various datasets and models with less time cost.

      <description>arXiv:2503.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issue: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which cause a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of proximity to the pre-learned cluster center. With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NLP Robustness and Generalization through LLM-Generated Contrast Sets: A Scalable Framework for Systematic Evaluation and Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard NLP benchmarks often fail to capture vulnerabilities stemming from dataset artifacts and spurious correlations. Contrast sets address this gap by challenging models near decision boundaries but are traditionally labor-intensive to create and limited in diversity. This study leverages large language models to automate the generation of diverse contrast sets. Using the SNLI dataset, we created a 3,000-example contrast set to evaluate and improve model robustness. Fine-tuning on these contrast sets enhanced performance on systematically perturbed examples, maintained standard test accuracy, and modestly improved generalization to novel perturbations. This automated approach offers a scalable solution for evaluating and improving NLP models, addressing systematic generalization challenges, and advancing robustness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>AA-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-shot Anomaly Detection via Anomaly-Aware CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies outliers for applications like defect and lesion detection. While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent Anomaly-Unawareness leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly-Aware CLIP (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Mwxinnn/AA-CLIP.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLM Agents for Cleaning Tabular Machine Learning Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality, error-free datasets are a key ingredient in building reliable, accurate, and unbiased machine learning (ML) models. However, real world datasets often suffer from errors due to sensor malfunctions, data entry mistakes, or improper data integration across multiple sources that can severely degrade model performance. Detecting and correcting these issues typically require tailor-made solutions and demand extensive domain expertise. Consequently, automation is challenging, rendering the process labor-intensive and tedious. In this study, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help alleviate the burden of manual data cleaning. We set up an experiment in which an LLM, paired with Python, is tasked with cleaning the training dataset to improve the performance of a learning algorithm without having the ability to modify the training pipeline or perform any feature engineering. We run this experiment on multiple Kaggle datasets that have been intentionally corrupted with errors. Our results show that LLMs can identify and correct erroneous entries, such as illogical values or outlier, by leveraging contextual information from other features within the same row, as well as feedback from previous iterations. However, they struggle to detect more complex errors that require understanding data distribution across multiple rows, such as trends and biases.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: Unified Generation of Sequence and Structure with Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</description>

      <title>Censoring-Aware Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning for Estimating Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Censored Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) provide a systematic approach for making sequential treatment decisions that adapt to individual patient characteristics, particularly in clinical contexts where survival outcomes are of interest. Censoring-Aware Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning (CA-TRL) is a novel framework to address the complexities associated with censored data when estimating optimal DTRs. We explore ways to learn effective DTRs, from observational data. By enhancing traditional tree-based reinforcement learning methods with augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) and censoring-aware modifications, CA-TRL delivers robust and interpretable treatment strategies. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world applications using the SANAD epilepsy dataset, where it outperformed the recently proposed ASCL method in key metrics such as restricted mean survival time (RMST) and decision-making accuracy. This work represents a step forward in advancing personalized and data-driven treatment strategies across diverse healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>InftyThink: Breaking the Length Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.</description>

      <title>PFDial: A Structured Dialogue Instruction Fine-tuning Method Based on UML Flowcharts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models often generate factually incorrect but plausible outputs, known as hallucinations. We identify a more insidious phenomenon, LLM delusion, defined as high belief hallucinations, incorrect outputs with abnormally high confidence, making them harder to detect and mitigate. Unlike ordinary hallucinations, delusions persist with low uncertainty, posing significant challenges to model reliability. Through empirical analysis across different model families and sizes on several Question Answering tasks, we show that delusions are prevalent and distinct from hallucinations. LLMs exhibit lower honesty with delusions, which are harder to override via finetuning or self reflection. We link delusion formation with training dynamics and dataset noise and explore mitigation strategies such as retrieval augmented generation and multi agent debating to mitigate delusions. By systematically investigating the nature, prevalence, and mitigation of LLM delusions, our study provides insights into the underlying causes of this phenomenon and outlines future directions for improving model reliability.</description>

      <title>Pull-Based Query Scheduling for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ACAI for SBOs: AI Co-creation for Advertising and Inspiration for Small Business Owners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small business owners (SBOs) often lack the resources and design experience needed to produce high-quality advertisements. To address this, we developed ACAI (AI Co-Creation for Advertising and Inspiration), an GenAI-powered multimodal advertisement creation tool, and conducted a user study with 16 SBOs in London to explore their perceptions of and interactions with ACAI in advertisement creation. Our findings reveal that structured inputs enhance user agency and control while improving AI outputs by facilitating better brand alignment, enhancing AI transparency, and offering scaffolding that assists novice designers, such as SBOs, in formulating prompts. We also found that ACAI's multimodal interface bridges the design skill gap for SBOs with a clear advertisement vision, but who lack the design jargon necessary for effective prompting. Building on our findings, we propose three capabilities: contextual intelligence, adaptive interactions, and data management, with corresponding design recommendations to advance the co-creative attributes of AI-mediated design tools.</description>

      <title>Gender Encoding Patterns in Pretrained Language Model Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender bias in pretrained language models (PLMs) poses significant social and ethical challenges. Despite growing awareness, there is a lack of comprehensive investigation into how different models internally represent and propagate such biases. This study adopts an information-theoretic approach to analyze how gender biases are encoded within various encoder-based architectures. We focus on three key aspects: identifying how models encode gender information and biases, examining the impact of bias mitigation techniques and fine-tuning on the encoded biases and their effectiveness, and exploring how model design differences influence the encoding of biases. Through rigorous and systematic investigation, our findings reveal a consistent pattern of gender encoding across diverse models. Surprisingly, debiasing techniques often exhibit limited efficacy, sometimes inadvertently increasing the encoded bias in internal representations while reducing bias in model output distributions. This highlights a disconnect between mitigating bias in output distributions and addressing its internal representations. This work provides valuable guidance for advancing bias mitigation strategies and fostering the development of more equitable language models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we devise three actor-critic algorithms with decentralized training for multi-agent reinforcement learning in cooperative, adversarial, and mixed settings with continuous action spaces. To this goal, we adapt the MADDPG algorithm by applying a networked communication approach between agents. We introduce surrogate policies in order to decentralize the training while allowing for local communication during training. The decentralized algorithms achieve comparable results to the original MADDPG in empirical tests, while reducing computational cost. This is more pronounced with larger numbers of agents.</description>

      <title>Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description>

      <title>SemHiTok: A Unified Image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Codebook for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete feature representations for multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves state-of-the-art rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Zero-shot-CoT in Japanese Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the effectiveness of zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Japanese and English using ChatGPT-3.5 and 4o-mini. The technique of zero-shot CoT, which involves appending a phrase such as "Let's think step by step" to a prompt to encourage reasoning before answering, has been shown to offer LLM performance improvements in mathematical and reasoning tasks, particularly in English. We investigate how these effects transfer to Japanese using the Japanese Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark (JMMLU) and the Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark (MMLU). Our results show that while zero-shot CoT prompting can lead to notable performance gains for some prompt categories in GPT-3.5, its impact in GPT-4o-mini is associated with significant performance declines. However, for Japanese prompts there remain certain categories, such as college mathematics and abstract algebra, that still exhibit improvements, despite the broader trend of diminishing effectiveness in more advanced models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Effective Human Annotation Assistants, But Not Good Independent Annotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event annotation is important for identifying market changes, monitoring breaking news, and understanding sociological trends. Although expert annotators set the gold standards, human coding is expensive and inefficient. Unlike information extraction experiments that focus on single contexts, we evaluate a holistic workflow that removes irrelevant documents, merges documents about the same event, and annotates the events. Although LLM-based automated annotations are better than traditional TF-IDF-based methods or Event Set Curation, they are still not reliable annotators compared to human experts. However, adding LLMs to assist experts for Event Set Curation can reduce the time and mental effort required for Variable Annotation. When using LLMs to extract event variables to assist expert annotators, they agree more with the extracted variables than fully automated LLMs for annotation.</description>

      <title>Dr Genre: Reinforcement Learning from Decoupled LLM Feedback for Generic Text Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic text rewriting is a prevalent large language model (LLM) application that covers diverse real-world tasks, such as style transfer, fact correction, and email editing. These tasks vary in rewriting objectives (e.g., factual consistency vs. semantic preservation), making it challenging to develop a unified model that excels across all dimensions. Existing methods often specialize in either a single task or a specific objective, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in factuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate real-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite dataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw emails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including LongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic rewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic rewrite models. To align with task-specific objectives, we propose Dr Genre, a Decoupled-reward learning framework for Generic rewriting, that utilizes objective-oriented reward models with a task-specific weighting. Evaluation shows that \approach delivers higher-quality rewrites across all targeted tasks, improving objectives including instruction following (agreement), internal consistency (coherence), and minimal unnecessary edits (conciseness).</description>

      <title>Infinite Leagues Under the Sea: Photorealistic 3D Underwater Terrain Generation by Latent Fractal Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of generating representations of underwater 3D terrain. Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation.</description>

      <title>GenDR: Lightning Generative Detail Restorator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research applying text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to real-world super-resolution (SR) has achieved remarkable success. However, fundamental misalignments between T2I and SR targets result in a dilemma between inference speed and detail fidelity. Specifically, T2I tasks prioritize multi-step inversion to synthesize coherent outputs aligned with textual prompts and shrink the latent space to reduce generating complexity. Contrariwise, SR tasks preserve most information from low-resolution input while solely restoring high-frequency details, thus necessitating sufficient latent space and fewer inference steps. To bridge the gap, we present a one-step diffusion model for generative detail restoration, GenDR, distilled from a tailored diffusion model with larger latent space. In detail, we train a new SD2.1-VAE16 (0.9B) via representation alignment to expand latent space without enlarging the model size. Regarding step-distillation, we propose consistent score identity distillation (CiD) that incorporates SR task-specific loss into score distillation to leverage more SR priors and align the training target. Furthermore, we extend CiD with adversarial learning and representation alignment (CiDA) to enhance perceptual quality and accelerate training. We also polish the pipeline to achieve a more efficient inference. Experimental results demonstrate that GenDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>AutoMisty: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Code Generation in the Misty Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Astrocyte-Like Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional artificial neural networks take inspiration from biological networks, using layers of neuron-like nodes to pass information for processing. More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.</description>

      <title>Actionable AI: Enabling Non Experts to Understand and Configure AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction between humans and AI systems raises the question of how people understand AI systems. This has been addressed with explainable AI, the interpretability arising from users' domain expertise, or collaborating with AI in a stable environment. In the absence of these elements, we discuss designing Actionable AI, which allows non-experts to configure black-box agents. In this paper, we experiment with an AI-powered cartpole game and observe 22 pairs of participants to configure it via direct manipulation. Our findings suggest that, in uncertain conditions, non-experts were able to achieve good levels of performance. By influencing the behaviour of the agent, they exhibited an operational understanding of it, which proved sufficient to reach their goals. Based on this, we derive implications for designing Actionable AI systems. In conclusion, we propose Actionable AI as a way to open access to AI-based agents, giving end users the agency to influence such agents towards their own goals.</description>

      <title>Privacy Auditing of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current techniques for privacy auditing of large language models (LLMs) have limited efficacy -- they rely on basic approaches to generate canaries which leads to weak membership inference attacks that in turn give loose lower bounds on the empirical privacy leakage. We develop canaries that are far more effective than those used in prior work under threat models that cover a range of realistic settings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple families of fine-tuned LLMs that our approach sets a new standard for detection of privacy leakage. For measuring the memorization rate of non-privately trained LLMs, our designed canaries surpass prior approaches. For example, on the Qwen2.5-0.5B model, our designed canaries achieve $49.6\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR, vastly surpassing the prior approach's $4.2\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR. Our method can be used to provide a privacy audit of $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for a model trained with theoretical $\varepsilon$ of 4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a privacy audit of LLM training has achieved nontrivial auditing success in the setting where the attacker cannot train shadow models, insert gradient canaries, or access the model at every iteration.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Preference Hacking in Policy Optimization with Pessimism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles the problem of overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a prevalent technique for aligning models with human preferences. RLHF relies on reward or preference models trained on \emph{fixed preference datasets}, and these models are unreliable when evaluated outside the support of this preference data, leading to the common reward or preference hacking phenomenon. We propose novel, pessimistic objectives for RLHF which are provably robust to overoptimization through the use of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and design practical algorithms, P3O and PRPO, to optimize these objectives. Our approach is derived for the general preference optimization setting, but can be used with reward models as well. We evaluate P3O and PRPO on the tasks of fine-tuning language models for document summarization and creating helpful assistants, demonstrating remarkable resilience to overoptimization.</description>

      <title>Can Proof Assistants Verify Multi-Agent Systems?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Soda language for verifying multi-agent systems. Soda is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with Soda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Generalization for Robotics via Modularity and Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale vision models like SAM have extensive visual knowledge, yet their general nature and computational demands limit their use in specialized tasks like medical image segmentation. In contrast, task-specific models such as U-Net++ often underperform due to sparse labeled data. This study introduces a strategic knowledge mining method that leverages SAM's broad understanding to boost the performance of small, locally hosted deep learning models.
  In our approach, we trained a U-Net++ model on a limited labeled dataset and extend its capabilities by converting SAM's output infered on unlabeled images into prompts. This process not only harnesses SAM's generalized visual knowledge but also iteratively improves SAM's prediction to cater specialized medical segmentation tasks via U-Net++. The mined knowledge, serving as "pseudo labels", enriches the training dataset, enabling the fine-tuning of the local network.
  Applied to the Kvasir SEG and COVID-QU-Ex datasets which consist of gastrointestinal polyp and lung X-ray images respectively, our proposed method consistently enhanced the segmentation performance on Dice by 3% and 1% respectively over the baseline U-Net++ model, when the same amount of labelled data were used during training (75% and 50% of labelled data). Remarkably, our proposed method surpassed the baseline U-Net++ model even when the latter was trained exclusively on labeled data (100% of labelled data). These results underscore the potential of knowledge mining to overcome data limitations in specialized models by leveraging the broad, albeit general, knowledge of large-scale models like SAM, all while maintaining operational efficiency essential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-Grained Video Question Answering</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of video understanding, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) remains a focal point. However, existing datasets exhibit gaps in temporal and spatial granularity, which consequently limits the capabilities of existing VideoQA methods. This paper introduces the Multi-Object Multi-Actor Question Answering (MOMA-QA) dataset, which is designed to address these shortcomings by emphasizing temporal localization, spatial relationship reasoning, and entity-centric queries. With ground truth scene graphs and temporal interval annotations, MOMA-QA is ideal for developing models for fine-grained video understanding. Furthermore, we present a novel video-language model, SGVLM, which incorporates a scene graph predictor, an efficient frame retriever, and a pre-trained large language model for temporal localization and fine-grained relationship understanding. Evaluations on MOMA-QA and other public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, setting new benchmarks for VideoQA.</description>

      <title>Towards a Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive glioma characterization is crucial for effective clinical management. Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p&lt;=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>AttFC: Attention Fully-Connected Layer for Large-Scale Face Recognition with One GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the availability of large-scale datasets, the face recognition (FR) model has achieved exceptional performance. However, since the parameter magnitude of the fully connected (FC) layer directly depends on the number of identities in the dataset. If training the FR model on large-scale datasets, the size of the model parameter will be excessively huge, leading to substantial demand for computational resources, such as time and memory. This paper proposes the attention fully connected (AttFC) layer, which could significantly reduce computational resources. AttFC employs an attention loader to generate the generative class center (GCC), and dynamically store the class center with Dynamic Class Container (DCC). DCC only stores a small subset of all class centers in FC, thus its parameter count is substantially less than the FC layer. Also, training face recognition models on large-scale datasets with one GPU often encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues. AttFC overcomes this and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Multi-Tuple Extraction for Alloys: Integrating Pointer Networks and Augmented Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting high-quality structured information from scientific literature is crucial for advancing material design through data-driven methods. Despite the considerable research in natural language processing for dataset extraction, effective approaches for multi-tuple extraction in scientific literature remain scarce due to the complex interrelations of tuples and contextual ambiguities. In the study, we illustrate the multi-tuple extraction of mechanical properties from multi-principal-element alloys and presents a novel framework that combines an entity extraction model based on MatSciBERT with pointer networks and an allocation model utilizing inter- and intra-entity attention. Our rigorous experiments on tuple extraction demonstrate impressive F1 scores of 0.963, 0.947, 0.848, and 0.753 across datasets with 1, 2, 3, and 4 tuples, confirming the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, an F1 score of 0.854 was achieved on a randomly curated dataset. These results highlight the model's capacity to deliver precise and structured information, offering a robust alternative to large language models and equipping researchers with essential data for fostering data-driven innovations.</description>

      <title>Graphormer-Guided Task Planning: Beyond Static Rules with LLM Safety Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role in robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating feasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains underdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception, making them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency hazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a Graphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based decision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a dynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk factors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework introduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines safety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more flexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive safety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates improvements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task adaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static rule-based and LLM-only baselines.

      <title>Lost-in-the-Middle in Long-Text Generation: Synthetic Dataset, Evaluation Framework, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing long-text generation methods primarily concentrate on producing lengthy texts from short inputs, neglecting the long-input and long-output tasks. Such tasks have numerous practical applications while lacking available benchmarks. Moreover, as the input grows in length, existing methods inevitably encounter the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. In this paper, we first introduce a Long Input and Output Benchmark (LongInOutBench), including a synthetic dataset and a comprehensive evaluation framework, addressing the challenge of the missing benchmark. We then develop the Retrieval-Augmented Long-Text Writer (RAL-Writer), which retrieves and restates important yet overlooked content, mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" issue by constructing explicit prompts. We finally employ the proposed LongInOutBench to evaluate our RAL-Writer against comparable baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code has been released at https://github.com/OnlyAR/RAL-Writer.</description>

      <title>Interactive Medical Image Analysis with Concept-based Similarity Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Cannot Count, and Prompt Refinement Cannot Help</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability.
  Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Policy Regularization on Globally Accessible States in Cross-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To learn from data collected in diverse dynamics, Imitation from Observation (IfO) methods leverage expert state trajectories based on the premise that recovering expert state distributions in other dynamics facilitates policy learning in the current one. However, Imitation Learning inherently imposes a performance upper bound of learned policies. Additionally, as the environment dynamics change, certain expert states may become inaccessible, rendering their distributions less valuable for imitation. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates reward maximization with IfO, employing F-distance regularized policy optimization. This framework enforces constraints on globally accessible states--those with nonzero visitation frequency across all considered dynamics--mitigating the challenge posed by inaccessible states. By instantiating F-distance in different ways, we derive two theoretical analysis and develop a practical algorithm called Accessible State Oriented Policy Regularization (ASOR). ASOR serves as a general add-on module that can be incorporated into various RL approaches, including offline RL and off-policy RL. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate ASOR's effectiveness in enhancing state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms, significantly improving their performance.</description>

      <title>From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with TaylorSeers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: This paper investigates a critical aspect of large language model (LLM) performance: the optimal formatting of classification task options in prompts. Through an extensive experimental study, we compared two selection formats -- bullet points and plain English -- to determine their impact on model performance. Our findings suggest that presenting options via bullet points generally yields better results, although there are some exceptions. Furthermore, our research highlights the need for continued exploration of option formatting to drive further improvements in model performance.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Guided Progressive Feature Alignment for Multimodal UAV Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal UAV object detection methods often overlook the impact of semantic gaps between modalities, which makes it difficult to achieve accurate semantic and spatial alignments, limiting detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment. Comprehensive experiments on two public multimodal UAV object detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal UAV object detectors.</description>

      <title>Capture Global Feature Statistics for One-Shot Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) necessitates numerous rounds of communication between the server and clients, posing significant challenges including high communication costs, connection drop risks and susceptibility to privacy attacks. One-shot FL has become a compelling learning paradigm to overcome above drawbacks by enabling the training of a global server model via a single communication round. However, existing one-shot FL methods suffer from expensive computation cost on the server or clients and cannot deal with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data stably and effectively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FedCGS, a novel Federated learning algorithm that Capture Global feature Statistics leveraging pre-trained models. With global feature statistics, we achieve training-free and heterogeneity-resistant one-shot FL. Furthermore, we extend its application to personalization scenario, where clients only need execute one extra communication round with server to download global statistics. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse data heterogeneity settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Yuqin-G/FedCGS.</description>

      <title>Multi-Behavior Recommender Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on a single type of user-item interaction, such as item purchases or ratings, to predict user preferences. However, in real-world scenarios, users engage in a variety of behaviors, such as clicking on items or adding them to carts, offering richer insights into their interests. Multi-behavior recommender systems leverage these diverse interactions to enhance recommendation quality, and research on this topic has grown rapidly in recent years. This survey provides a timely review of multi-behavior recommender systems, focusing on three key steps: (1) Data Modeling: representing multi-behaviors at the input level, (2) Encoding: transforming these inputs into vector representations (i.e., embeddings), and (3) Training: optimizing machine-learning models. We systematically categorize existing multi-behavior recommender systems based on the commonalities and differences in their approaches across the above steps. Additionally, we discuss promising future directions for advancing multi-behavior recommender systems.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset and Model for Crop Disease Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While conversational generative AI has shown considerable potential in enhancing decision-making for agricultural professionals, its exploration has predominantly been anchored in text-based interactions. The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications. The dataset is available at https: //github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CDDMBench.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of intelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine conservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Learning Dynamics of LoRA: A Gradient Flow Perspective on Low-Rank Adaptation in Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning pre-trained models, there is little theoretical understanding of how first-order methods with carefully crafted initialization adapt models to new tasks. In this work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring social bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but existing bias evaluation methods struggle to assess bias in long-form generation. We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.</description>

      <title>NukesFormers: Unpaired Hyperspectral Image Generation with Non-Uniform Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent difficulty in acquiring accurately co-registered RGB-hyperspectral image (HSI) pairs has significantly impeded the practical deployment of current data-driven Hyperspectral Image Generation (HIG) networks in engineering applications. Gleichzeitig, the ill-posed nature of the aligning constraints, compounded with the complexities of mining cross-domain features, also hinders the advancement of unpaired HIG (UnHIG) tasks. In this paper, we conquer these challenges by modeling the UnHIG to range space interaction and compensations of null space through Range-Null Space Decomposition (RND) methodology. Specifically, the introduced contrastive learning effectively aligns the geometric and spectral distributions of unpaired data by building the interaction of range space, considering the consistent feature in degradation process. Following this, we map the frequency representations of dual-domain input and thoroughly mining the null space, like degraded and high-frequency components, through the proposed Non-uniform Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that it establishes a new benchmark in UnHIG.</description>

      <title>Combating Partial Perception Deficit in Autonomous Driving with Multimodal LLM Commonsense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.</description>

Abstract: Labeled datasets are essential for modern search engines, which increasingly rely on supervised learning methods like Learning to Rank and massive amounts of data to power deep learning models. However, creating these datasets is both time-consuming and costly, leading to the common use of user click and activity logs as proxies for relevance. In this paper, we present a weak supervision approach to infer the quality of query-document pairs and apply it within a Learning to Rank framework to enhance the precision of a large-scale search system.</description>

      <title>Erase Diffusion: Empowering Object Removal Through Calibrating Diffusion Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erase inpainting, or object removal, aims to precisely remove target objects within masked regions while preserving the overall consistency of the surrounding content. Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant strides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the emergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact diffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms constrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the potential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In contrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization paradigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the erasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO) paradigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with the objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion transition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during optimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object removal. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the sampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention (SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering self-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts while further enhancing the coherence of the generated content. With this design, our proposed EraDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages V5 dataset and demonstrates significant superiority in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Availability-aware Sensor Fusion via Unified Canonical Space for 4D Radar, LiDAR, and Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor fusion of camera, LiDAR, and 4-dimensional (4D) Radar has brought a significant performance improvement in autonomous driving (AD). However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost. The code will be available at https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar.</description>

Abstract: We present "Bot Wars," a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) scam-baiters to counter phone scams through simulated adversarial dialogues. Our key contribution is a formal foundation for strategy emergence through chain-of-thought reasoning without explicit optimization. Through a novel two-layer prompt architecture, our framework enables LLMs to craft demographically authentic victim personas while maintaining strategic coherence. We evaluate our approach using a dataset of 3,200 scam dialogues validated against 179 hours of human scam-baiting interactions, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex adversarial dynamics. Our systematic evaluation through cognitive, quantitative, and content-specific metrics shows that GPT-4 excels in dialogue naturalness and persona authenticity, while Deepseek demonstrates superior engagement sustainability.</description>

      <title>DatawiseAgent: A Notebook-Centric LLM Agent Framework for Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Science tasks are multifaceted, dynamic, and often domain-specific. Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.</description>

      <title>TIDE : Temporal-Aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion Transformers in Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are a powerful yet underexplored class of generative models compared to U-Net-based diffusion models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIDE (Temporal-aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs), a novel framework that enhances temporal reconstruction within DiT activation layers across denoising steps. TIDE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with a sparse bottleneck layer to extract interpretable and hierarchical features, revealing that diffusion models inherently learn hierarchical features at multiple levels (e.g., 3D, semantic, class) during generative pre-training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a cosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing activation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we showcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse activation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved controllability for generative systems. By providing a comprehensive training and evaluation protocol tailored for DiTs, TIDE contributes to developing more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy generative models.</description>

      <title>Generative method for aerodynamic optimization based on classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design approach, which directly generates optimal aerodynamic shape with neural network models to meet designated performance targets, has drawn enormous attention. However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design approach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network, demonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes and struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance indicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based on the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM) is proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively capture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by adjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper and lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated pressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into airfoil geometries through a mapping model. Experimental results using classical transonic airfoils as examples show that the inverse design based on CDDPM can generate a variety of pressure coefficient distributions, which enriches the diversity of design results. Compared with current state-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM achieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a practical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based on global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy, aiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the inverse design framework. This work is not only suitable for the airfoils design, but also has the capability to apply to optimization process of general product parts targeting selected performance indicators.</description>

      <title>DistiLLM-2: A Contrastive Approach Boosts the Distillation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.</description>

      <title>PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>NFIG: Autoregressive Image Generation with Next-Frequency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>An Experience Report on Regression-Free Repair of Deep Neural Network Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in industry. In the process of system operation, DNNs need to be updated in order to improve their performance. When updating DNNs, systems used in companies that require high reliability must have as few regressions as possible. Since the update of DNNs has a data-driven nature, it is difficult to suppress regressions as expected by developers. This paper identifies the requirements for DNN updating in industry and presents a case study using techniques to meet those requirements. In the case study, we worked on satisfying the requirement to update models trained on car images collected in Fujitsu assuming security applications without regression for a specific class. We were able to suppress regression by customizing the objective function based on NeuRecover, a DNN repair technique. Moreover, we discuss some of the challenges identified in the case study.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Representation Uncertainty in Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Computer Vision have introduced the concept of pretrained representation uncertainty, enabling zero-shot uncertainty estimation. This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

      <title>FaceID-6M: A Large-Scale, Open-Source FaceID Customization Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the data-driven nature of current face identity (FaceID) customization methods, all state-of-the-art models rely on large-scale datasets containing millions of high-quality text-image pairs for training. However, none of these datasets are publicly available, which restricts transparency and hinders further advancements in the field.
  To address this issue, in this paper, we collect and release FaceID-6M, the first large-scale, open-source FaceID dataset containing 6 million high-quality text-image pairs. Filtered from LAION-5B \cite{schuhmann2022laion}, FaceID-6M undergoes a rigorous image and text filtering steps to ensure dataset quality, including resolution filtering to maintain high-quality images and faces, face filtering to remove images that lack human faces, and keyword-based strategy to retain descriptions containing human-related terms (e.g., nationality, professions and names). Through these cleaning processes, FaceID-6M provides a high-quality dataset optimized for training powerful FaceID customization models, facilitating advancements in the field by offering an open resource for research and development.
  We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our FaceID-6M, demonstrating that models trained on our FaceID-6M dataset achieve performance that is comparable to, and slightly better than currently available industrial models. Additionally, to support and advance research in the FaceID customization community, we make our code, datasets, and models fully publicly available. Our codes, models, and datasets are available at: https://github.com/ShuheSH/FaceID-6M.</description>

      <title>A LSTM-Transformer Model for pulsation control of pVADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods: A method of the pulsation for a pVAD is proposed (AP-pVAD Model). AP-pVAD Model consists of two parts: NPQ Model and LSTM-Transformer Model. (1)The NPQ Model determines the mathematical relationship between motor speed, pressure, and flow rate for the pVAD. (2)The Attention module of Transformer neural network is integrated into the LSTM neural network to form the new LSTM-Transformer Model to predict the pulsation time characteristic points for adjusting the motor speed of the pVAD. Results: The AP-pVAD Model is validated in three hydraulic experiments and an animal experiment. (1)The pressure provided by pVAD calculated with the NPQ Model has a maximum error of only 2.15 mmHg compared to the expected values. (2)The pulsation time characteristic points predicted by the LSTM-Transformer Model shows a maximum prediction error of 1.78ms, which is significantly lower than other methods. (3)The in-vivo test of pVAD in animal experiment has significant improvements in aortic pressure. Animals survive for over 27 hours after the initiation of pVAD operation. Conclusion: (1)For a given pVAD, motor speed has a linear relationship with pressure and a quadratic relationship with flow. (2)Deep learning can be used to predict pulsation characteristic time points, with the LSTM-Transformer Model demonstrating minimal prediction error and better robust performance under conditions of limited dataset sizes, elevated noise levels, and diverse hyperparameter combinations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ASTRA: A Negotiation Agent with Adaptive and Strategic Reasoning through Action in Dynamic Offer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negotiation requires dynamically balancing self-interest and cooperation to maximize one's own utility. Yet, existing agents struggle due to bounded rationality in human data, low adaptability to counterpart behavior, and limited strategic reasoning. To address this, we introduce principle-driven negotiation agents, powered by ASTRA, a novel framework for turn-level offer optimization grounded in two core principles: opponent modeling and Tit-for-Tat reciprocity. ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) interpreting counterpart behavior, (2) optimizing counteroffers via a linear programming (LP) solver, and (3) selecting offers based on negotiation tactics and the partner's acceptance probability. Through simulations and human evaluations, our agent effectively adapts to an opponent's shifting stance and achieves favorable outcomes through enhanced adaptability and strategic reasoning. Beyond improving negotiation performance, it also serves as a powerful coaching tool, offering interpretable strategic feedback and optimal offer recommendations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Mixture-of-Experts: Algorithms, Theory, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an essential task in evaluating natural language understanding. Existing MRC datasets primarily assess specific aspects of reading comprehension (RC), lacking a comprehensive MRC benchmark. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes the key capabilities required for RC. Based on this taxonomy, we construct MRCEval, an MRC benchmark that leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) as both sample generators and selection judges. MRCEval is a comprehensive, challenging and accessible benchmark designed to assess the RC capabilities of LLMs thoroughly, covering 13 distinct RC skills with a total of 2.1K high-quality multi-choice questions. We perform an extensive evaluation of 28 widely used open-source and proprietary models, highlighting that MRC continues to present significant challenges even in the era of LLMs.</description>

      <title>PTMs-TSCIL Pre-Trained Models Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for time series data faces critical challenges in balancing stability against catastrophic forgetting and plasticity for new knowledge acquisition, particularly under real-world constraints where historical data access is restricted. While pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown promise in CIL for vision and NLP domains, their potential in time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) remains underexplored due to the scarcity of large-scale time series pre-trained models. Prompted by the recent emergence of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) for time series data, we present the first exploration of PTM-based Time Series Class-Incremental Learning (TSCIL). Our approach leverages frozen PTM backbones coupled with incrementally tuning the shared adapter, preserving generalization capabilities while mitigating feature drift through knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Drift Compensation Network (DCN), designed with a novel two-stage training strategy to precisely model feature space transformations across incremental tasks. This allows for accurate projection of old class prototypes into the new feature space. By employing DCN-corrected prototypes, we effectively enhance the unified classifier retraining, mitigating model feature drift and alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our method yielding final accuracy gains of 1.4%-6.1% across all datasets compared to existing PTM-based approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for TSCIL, providing insights into stability-plasticity optimization for continual learning systems.</description>

      <title>Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>DeFine: A Decomposed and Fine-Grained Annotated Dataset for Long-form Article Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-form article generation (LFAG) presents challenges such as maintaining logical consistency, comprehensive topic coverage, and narrative coherence across extended articles. Existing datasets often lack both the hierarchical structure and fine-grained annotation needed to effectively decompose tasks, resulting in shallow, disorganized article generation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFine, a Decomposed and Fine-grained annotated dataset for long-form article generation. DeFine is characterized by its hierarchical decomposition strategy and the integration of domain-specific knowledge with multi-level annotations, ensuring granular control and enhanced depth in article generation. To construct the dataset, a multi-agent collaborative pipeline is proposed, which systematically segments the generation process into four parts: Data Miner, Cite Retreiver, Q&amp;A Annotator and Data Cleaner. To validate the effectiveness of DeFine, we designed and tested three LFAG baselines: the web retrieval, the local retrieval, and the grounded reference. We fine-tuned the Qwen2-7b-Instruct model using the DeFine training dataset. The experimental results showed significant improvements in text quality, specifically in topic coverage, depth of information, and content fidelity. Our dataset publicly available to facilitate future research.</description>

Traditional methods rely on orthomosaic stitching from rigid flight paths, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Gaussian Process (GP)-based mapping offers continuous modelling of the underlying variable (i.e. weed distribution) but requires discretisation for practical tasks like path planning or visualisation. Current implementations often default to quadtrees or gridmaps without systematically evaluating alternatives. This study compares five discretisation methods: quadtrees, wedgelets, top-down binary space partition (BSP) trees using least square error (LSE), bottom-up BSP trees using graph merging, and variable-resolution hexagonal grids. Evaluations on real-world weed distributions measure visual similarity, mean squared error (MSE), and computational efficiency. Results show quadtrees perform best overall, but alternatives excel in specific scenarios: hexagons or BSP LSE suit fields with large, dominant weed patches, while quadtrees are optimal for dispersed small-scale distributions. These findings highlight the need to tailor discretisation approaches to weed distribution patterns (patch size, density, coverage) rather than relying on default methods. By choosing representations based on the underlying distribution, we can improve mapping accuracy and efficiency for precision agriculture applications.</description>

Abstract: Existing approaches to zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) for low-resource languages have primarily relied on machine translation, whereas more recent methods have shifted focus to phonemic representation. Building upon this, we investigate how reducing the phonemic representation gap in IPA transcription between languages with similar phonetic characteristics enables models trained on high-resource languages to perform effectively on low-resource languages. In this work, we propose CONtrastive Learning with IPA (CONLIPA) dataset containing 10 English and high resource languages IPA pairs from 10 frequently used language families. We also propose a cross-lingual IPA Contrastive learning method (IPAC) using the CONLIPA dataset. Furthermore, our proposed dataset and methodology demonstrate a substantial average gain when compared to the best performing baseline.</description>

      <title>CoT-Drive: Efficient Motion Forecasting for Autonomous Driving with LLMs and Chain-of-Thought Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is crucial for safe autonomous driving (AD). This study proposes CoT-Drive, a novel approach that enhances motion forecasting by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method. We introduce a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy to effectively transfer LLMs' advanced scene understanding capabilities to lightweight language models (LMs), ensuring that CoT-Drive operates in real-time on edge devices while maintaining comprehensive scene understanding and generalization capabilities. By leveraging CoT prompting techniques for LLMs without additional training, CoT-Drive generates semantic annotations that significantly improve the understanding of complex traffic environments, thereby boosting the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Additionally, we present two new scene description datasets, Highway-Text and Urban-Text, designed for fine-tuning lightweight LMs to generate context-specific semantic annotations. Comprehensive evaluations of five real-world datasets demonstrate that CoT-Drive outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex traffic scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to consider the practical application of LLMs in this field. It pioneers the training and use of a lightweight LLM surrogate for motion forecasting, setting a new benchmark and showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs into AD systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-C3MOD: A Human-LLM Collaborative System for Cross-Cultural Hate Speech Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Content moderation is a global challenge, yet major tech platforms prioritize high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with scarce native moderators. Since effective moderation depends on understanding contextual cues, this imbalance increases the risk of improper moderation due to non-native moderators' limited cultural understanding. Through a user study, we identify that non-native moderators struggle with interpreting culturally-specific knowledge, sentiment, and internet culture in the hate speech moderation. To assist them, we present LLM-C3MOD, a human-LLM collaborative pipeline with three steps: (1) RAG-enhanced cultural context annotations; (2) initial LLM-based moderation; and (3) targeted human moderation for cases lacking LLM consensus. Evaluated on a Korean hate speech dataset with Indonesian and German participants, our system achieves 78% accuracy (surpassing GPT-4o's 71% baseline), while reducing human workload by 83.6%. Notably, human moderators excel at nuanced contents where LLMs struggle. Our findings suggest that non-native moderators, when properly supported by LLMs, can effectively contribute to cross-cultural hate speech moderation.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Automated Tool for Abdominal CT Body Composition Analysis in Gastrointestinal Cancer Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers remains significantly high, particularly in China, emphasizing the importance of accurate prognostic assessments and effective treatment strategies. Research shows a strong correlation between abdominal muscle and fat tissue composition and patient outcomes. However, existing manual methods for analyzing abdominal tissue composition are time-consuming and costly, limiting clinical research scalability. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-driven tool for automated analysis of abdominal CT scans to effectively identify and segment muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. Our tool integrates a multi-view localization model and a high-precision 2D nnUNet-based segmentation model, demonstrating a localization accuracy of 90% and a Dice Score Coefficient of 0.967 for segmentation. Furthermore, it features an interactive interface that allows clinicians to refine the segmentation results, ensuring high-quality outcomes effectively. Our tool offers a standardized method for effectively extracting critical abdominal tissues, potentially enhancing the management and treatment for gastrointestinal cancers.

      <title>COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO .</description>

      <title>WISE: A World Knowledge-Informed Semantic Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models are capable of generating high-quality artistic creations and visual content. However, existing research and evaluation standards predominantly focus on image realism and shallow text-image alignment, lacking a comprehensive assessment of complex semantic understanding and world knowledge integration in text to image generation. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{WISE}$, the first benchmark specifically designed for $\textbf{W}$orld Knowledge-$\textbf{I}$nformed $\textbf{S}$emantic $\textbf{E}$valuation. WISE moves beyond simple word-pixel mapping by challenging models with 1000 meticulously crafted prompts across 25 sub-domains in cultural common sense, spatio-temporal reasoning, and natural science. To overcome the limitations of traditional CLIP metric, we introduce $\textbf{WiScore}$, a novel quantitative metric for assessing knowledge-image alignment. Through comprehensive testing of 20 models (10 dedicated T2I models and 10 unified multimodal models) using 1,000 structured prompts spanning 25 subdomains, our findings reveal significant limitations in their ability to effectively integrate and apply world knowledge during image generation, highlighting critical pathways for enhancing knowledge incorporation and application in next-generation T2I models.

      <title>Federated Learning in NTNs: Design, Architecture and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>VizTrust: A Visual Analytics Tool for Capturing User Trust Dynamics in Human-AI Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust plays a fundamental role in shaping the willingness of users to engage and collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, measuring user trust remains challenging due to its complex and dynamic nature. While traditional survey methods provide trust levels for long conversations, they fail to capture its dynamic evolution during ongoing interactions. Here, we present VizTrust, which addresses this challenge by introducing a real-time visual analytics tool that leverages a multi-agent collaboration system to capture and analyze user trust dynamics in human-agent communication. Built on established human-computer trust scales-competence, integrity, benevolence, and predictability-, VizTrust enables stakeholders to observe trust formation as it happens, identify patterns in trust development, and pinpoint specific interaction elements that influence trust. Our tool offers actionable insights into human-agent trust formation and evolution in real time through a dashboard, supporting the design of adaptive conversational agents that responds effectively to user trust signals.</description>

      <title>Distilling Knowledge into Quantum Vision Transformers for Biomedical Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum vision transformers (QViTs) build on vision transformers (ViTs) by replacing linear layers within the self-attention mechanism with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing quantum mechanical properties to improve feature representation. This hybrid approach aims to achieve superior performance, with significantly reduced model complexity as a result of the enriched feature representation, requiring fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel QViT model for biomedical image classification and investigates its performance against comparable ViTs across eight diverse datasets, encompassing various modalities and classification tasks. We assess models trained from scratch and those pre-trained using knowledge distillation (KD) from high-quality teacher models. Our findings demonstrate that QViTs outperform comparable ViTs with average ROC AUC (0.863 vs 0.846) and accuracy (0.710 vs 0.687) when trained from scratch, and even compete with state-of-the-art classical models in multiple tasks, whilst being significantly more efficient (89% reduction in GFLOPs and 99.99% in parameter number). Additionally, we find that QViTs and ViTs respond equally well to KD, with QViT pre-training performance scaling with model complexity. This is the first investigation into the efficacy of deploying QViTs with KD for computer-aided diagnosis. Our results highlight the enormous potential of quantum machine learning (QML) in biomedical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Group-robust Sample Reweighting for Subpopulation Shifts via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models often have uneven performance among subpopulations (a.k.a., groups) in the data distributions. This poses a significant challenge for the models to generalize when the proportions of the groups shift during deployment. To improve robustness to such shifts, existing approaches have developed strategies that train models or perform hyperparameter tuning using the group-labeled data to minimize the worst-case loss over groups. However, a non-trivial amount of high-quality labels is often required to obtain noticeable improvements. Given the costliness of the labels, we propose to adopt a different paradigm to enhance group label efficiency: utilizing the group-labeled data as a target set to optimize the weights of other group-unlabeled data. We introduce Group-robust Sample Reweighting (GSR), a two-stage approach that first learns the representations from group-unlabeled data, and then tinkers the model by iteratively retraining its last layer on the reweighted data using influence functions. Our GSR is theoretically sound, practically lightweight, and effective in improving the robustness to subpopulation shifts. In particular, GSR outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that require the same amount or even more group labels.</description>

      <title>Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical coherence of the generated plans.The results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Experimental Exploration: Investigating Cooperative Interaction Behavior Between Humans and Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI agents as autonomous decision-makers present significant opportunities and challenges for human-AI cooperation. While many studies have explored human cooperation with AI as tools, the role of LLM-augmented autonomous agents in competitive-cooperative interactions remains under-examined. This study investigates human cooperative behavior by engaging 30 participants who interacted with LLM agents exhibiting different characteristics (purported human, purported rule-based AI agent, and LLM agent) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Findings show significant differences in cooperative behavior based on the agents' purported characteristics and the interaction effect of participants' genders and purported characteristics. We also analyzed human response patterns, including game completion time, proactive favorable behavior, and acceptance of repair efforts. These insights offer a new perspective on human interactions with LLM agents in competitive cooperation contexts, such as virtual avatars or future physical entities. The study underscores the importance of understanding human biases toward AI agents and how observed behaviors can influence future human-AI cooperation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Path Navigation for Motion Agents with LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.</description>

Abstract: The understanding of bias in AI is currently undergoing a revolution. Initially understood as errors or flaws, biases are increasingly recognized as integral to AI systems and sometimes preferable to less biased alternatives. In this paper, we review the reasons for this changed understanding and provide new guidance on two questions: First, how should we think about and measure biases in AI systems, consistent with the new understanding? Second, what kinds of bias in an AI system should we accept or even amplify, and what kinds should we minimize or eliminate, and why? The key to answering both questions, we argue, is to understand biases as "violations of a symmetry standard" (following Kelly). We distinguish three main types of asymmetry in AI systems-error biases, inequality biases, and process biases-and highlight places in the pipeline of AI development and application where bias of each type is likely to be good, bad, or inevitable.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Macro and Micro Effects of Random Seeds on Fine-Tuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model performance.In this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K. Our code and dataset are available at: https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/dnn-safety/m-hood.</description>

      <title>Temporal Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</description>

      <title>Research and Design on Intelligent Recognition of Unordered Targets for Robots Based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of robot target recognition research driven by artificial intelligence (AI), factors such as the disordered distribution of targets, the complexity of the environment, the massive scale of data, and noise interference have significantly restricted the improvement of target recognition accuracy. Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.</description>

      <title>The Economics of p(doom): Scenarios of Existential Risk and Economic Growth in the Age of Transformative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a diverse set of predictions about its long-term impact on humanity. A central focus is the potential emergence of transformative AI (TAI), eventually capable of outperforming humans in all economically valuable tasks and fully automating labor. Discussed scenarios range from human extinction after a misaligned TAI takes over ("AI doom") to unprecedented economic growth and abundance ("post-scarcity"). However, the probabilities and implications of these scenarios remain highly uncertain. Here, we organize the various scenarios and evaluate their associated existential risks and economic outcomes in terms of aggregate welfare. Our analysis shows that even low-probability catastrophic outcomes justify large investments in AI safety and alignment research. We find that the optimizing representative individual would rationally allocate substantial resources to mitigate extinction risk; in some cases, she would prefer not to develop TAI at all. This result highlights that current global efforts in AI safety and alignment research are vastly insufficient relative to the scale and urgency of existential risks posed by TAI. Our findings therefore underscore the need for stronger safeguards to balance the potential economic benefits of TAI with the prevention of irreversible harm. Addressing these risks is crucial for steering technological progress toward sustainable human prosperity.</description>

      <title>Artificial Utopia: Simulation and Intelligent Agents for a Democratised Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.</description>

      <title>Is My Text in Your AI Model? Gradient-based Membership Inference Test applied to LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work adapts and studies the gradient-based Membership Inference Test (gMINT) to the classification of text based on LLMs. MINT is a general approach intended to determine if given data was used for training machine learning models, and this work focuses on its application to the domain of Natural Language Processing. Using gradient-based analysis, the MINT model identifies whether particular data samples were included during the language model training phase, addressing growing concerns about data privacy in machine learning. The method was evaluated in seven Transformer-based models and six datasets comprising over 2.5 million sentences, focusing on text classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate MINTs robustness, achieving AUC scores between 85% and 99%, depending on data size and model architecture. These findings highlight MINTs potential as a scalable and reliable tool for auditing machine learning models, ensuring transparency, safeguarding sensitive data, and fostering ethical compliance in the deployment of AI/NLP technologies.</description>

      <title>TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: http://github.com/ddgoodgood/TRCE. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Adaptive Memory Dual-Net for Few-Shot Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot image classification has become a popular research topic for its wide application in real-world scenarios, however the problem of supervision collapse induced by single image-level annotation remains a major challenge. Existing methods aim to tackle this problem by locating and aligning relevant local features. However, the high intra-class variability in real-world images poses significant challenges in locating semantically relevant local regions under few-shot settings. Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods like RLHF face computational and stability challenges. While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer Self-Supervised Learning for High-Content Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning methods often fail to learn subtle or complex features, which can be dominated by simpler patterns which are much easier to learn. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.</description>

      <title>Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient Reinforcement Learning? The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration:
  1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework.
  2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration.
  3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time.
  4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/medagents-benchmark.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of natural language processing, many language models have been invented for multiple tasks. One important task is information retrieval (IR), which requires models to retrieve relevant documents. Despite its importance in many real-life applications, especially in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, this task lacks Vietnamese benchmarks. This situation causes difficulty in assessing and comparing many existing Vietnamese embedding language models on the task and slows down the advancement of Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) research. In this work, we aim to provide the Vietnamese research community with a new benchmark for information retrieval, which mainly focuses on retrieval and reranking tasks. Furthermore, we also present a new objective function based on the InfoNCE loss function, which is used to train our Vietnamese embedding model. Our function aims to be better than the origin in information retrieval tasks. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature, a hyper-parameter in both objective functions, on the performance of text embedding models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Membership Inference Attacks by Bayesian Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07482</link>

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to estimate whether a specific data point was used in the training of a given model. Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.</description>

      <title>V2Flow: Unifying Visual Tokenization and Large Language Model Vocabularies for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose V2Flow, a novel tokenizer that produces discrete visual tokens capable of high-fidelity reconstruction, while ensuring structural and latent distribution alignment with the vocabulary space of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging this tight visual-vocabulary coupling, V2Flow enables autoregressive visual generation on top of existing LLMs. Our approach formulates visual tokenization as a flow-matching problem, aiming to learn a mapping from a standard normal prior to the continuous image distribution, conditioned on token sequences embedded within the LLMs vocabulary space. The effectiveness of V2Flow stems from two core designs. First, we propose a Visual Vocabulary resampler, which compresses visual data into compact token sequences, with each represented as a soft categorical distribution over LLM's vocabulary. This allows seamless integration of visual tokens into existing LLMs for autoregressive visual generation. Second, we present a masked autoregressive Rectified-Flow decoder, employing a masked transformer encoder-decoder to refine visual tokens into contextually enriched embeddings. These embeddings then condition a dedicated velocity field for precise reconstruction. Additionally, an autoregressive rectified-flow sampling strategy is incorporated, ensuring flexible sequence lengths while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments show that V2Flow outperforms mainstream VQ-based tokenizers and facilitates autoregressive visual generation on top of existing. https://github.com/zhangguiwei610/V2Flow</description>

      <title>From Centralized to Decentralized Federated Learning: Theoretical Insights, Privacy Preservation, and Robustness Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without directly sharing individual's raw data. FL can be implemented in either a centralized (server-based) or decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner. In this survey, we present a novel perspective: the fundamental difference between centralized FL (CFL) and decentralized FL (DFL) is not merely the network topology, but the underlying training protocol: separate aggregation vs. joint optimization. We argue that this distinction in protocol leads to significant differences in model utility, privacy preservation, and robustness to attacks. We systematically review and categorize existing works in both CFL and DFL according to the type of protocol they employ. This taxonomy provides deeper insights into prior research and clarifies how various approaches relate or differ. Through our analysis, we identify key gaps in the literature. In particular, we observe a surprising lack of exploration of DFL approaches based on distributed optimization methods, despite their potential advantages. We highlight this under-explored direction and call for more research on leveraging distributed optimization for federated learning. Overall, this work offers a comprehensive overview from centralized to decentralized FL, sheds new light on the core distinctions between approaches, and outlines open challenges and future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Interference-Aware Super-Constellation Design for NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems</description>

      <title>Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". Our findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.</description>

      <title>TokenButler: Token Importance is Predictable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the Key-Value (KV) Cache to store token history, enabling efficient decoding of tokens. As the KV-Cache grows, it becomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has shown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each decoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they are dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk quality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on retrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense, context-rich tasks. Additionally, many existing KV-Cache sparsity methods rely on inaccurate proxies for token importance. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenButler, a high-granularity, query-aware predictor that learns to identify these critical tokens. By training a light-weight predictor with less than 1.2% parameter overhead, TokenButler prioritizes tokens based on their contextual, predicted importance. This improves perplexity &amp; downstream accuracy by over 8% relative to SoTA methods for estimating token importance. We evaluate TokenButler on a novel synthetic small-context co-referential retrieval task, demonstrating near-oracle accuracy.

      <title>LMM-R1: Empowering 3B LMMs with Strong Reasoning Abilities Through Two-Stage Rule-Based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning, particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.
  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.
  To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.
  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \method achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</description>

      <title>Geometric Retargeting: A Principled, Ultrafast Neural Hand Retargeting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Geometric Retargeting (GeoRT), an ultrafast, and principled neural hand retargeting algorithm for teleoperation, developed as part of our recent Dexterity Gen (DexGen) system. GeoRT converts human finger keypoints to robot hand keypoints at 1KHz, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy with significantly fewer hyperparameters. This high-speed capability enables flexible postprocessing, such as leveraging a foundational controller for action correction like DexGen. GeoRT is trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for manual annotation of hand pairs. The core of GeoRT lies in novel geometric objective functions that capture the essence of retargeting: preserving motion fidelity, ensuring configuration space (C-space) coverage, maintaining uniform response through high flatness, pinch correspondence and preventing self-collisions. This approach is free from intensive test-time optimization, offering a more scalable and practical solution for real-time hand retargeting.</description>

      <title>KSOD: Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Runtime Detection of Adversarial Attacks in AI Accelerators Using Performance Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid adoption of AI technologies raises several major security concerns, including the risks of adversarial perturbations, which threaten the confidentiality and integrity of AI applications. Protecting AI hardware from misuse and diverse security threats is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose SAMURAI, a novel framework for safeguarding against malicious usage of AI hardware and its resilience to attacks. SAMURAI introduces an AI Performance Counter (APC) for tracking dynamic behavior of an AI model coupled with an on-chip Machine Learning (ML) analysis engine, known as TANTO (Trained Anomaly Inspection Through Trace Observation). APC records the runtime profile of the low-level hardware events of different AI operations. Subsequently, the summary information recorded by the APC is processed by TANTO to efficiently identify potential security breaches and ensure secure, responsible use of AI. SAMURAI enables real-time detection of security threats and misuse without relying on traditional software-based solutions that require model integration. Experimental results demonstrate that SAMURAI achieves up to 97% accuracy in detecting adversarial attacks with moderate overhead on various AI models, significantly outperforming conventional software-based approaches. It enhances security and regulatory compliance, providing a comprehensive solution for safeguarding AI against emergent threats.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.</description>

      <title>Denoising Score Distillation: From Noisy Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.</description>

Abstract: As multimodal foundational models start being deployed experimentally in Self-Driving cars, a reasonable question we ask ourselves is how similar to humans do these systems respond in certain driving situations -- especially those that are out-of-distribution? To study this, we create the Robusto-1 dataset that uses dashcam video data from Peru, a country with one of the worst (aggressive) drivers in the world, a high traffic index, and a high ratio of bizarre to non-bizarre street objects likely never seen in training. In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.</description>

      <title>When Large Vision-Language Model Meets Large Remote Sensing Imagery: Coarse-to-Fine Text-Guided Token Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient vision-language understanding of large Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) is meaningful but challenging. Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings. Dataset and code are in https://github.com/VisionXLab/LRS-VQA.</description>

      <title>Filter Images First, Generate Instructions Later: Pre-Instruction Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

      <title>Denoising Hamiltonian Network for Physical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning frameworks for physical problems must capture and enforce physical constraints that preserve the structure of dynamical systems. Many existing approaches achieve this by integrating physical operators into neural networks. While these methods offer theoretical guarantees, they face two key limitations: (i) they primarily model local relations between adjacent time steps, overlooking longer-range or higher-level physical interactions, and (ii) they focus on forward simulation while neglecting broader physical reasoning tasks. We propose the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural operators. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships and mitigates numerical integration errors through a denoising mechanism. DHN also supports multi-system modeling with a global conditioning mechanism. We demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility across three diverse physical reasoning tasks with distinct inputs and outputs.</description>

      <title>NeuroChat: A Neuroadaptive AI Chatbot for Customizing Learning Experiences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is transforming education by enabling personalized, on-demand learning experiences. However, AI tutors lack the ability to assess a learner's cognitive state in real time, limiting their adaptability. Meanwhile, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neuroadaptive systems have successfully enhanced engagement by dynamically adjusting learning content. This paper presents NeuroChat, a proof-of-concept neuroadaptive AI tutor that integrates real-time EEG-based engagement tracking with generative AI. NeuroChat continuously monitors a learner's cognitive engagement and dynamically adjusts content complexity, response style, and pacing using a closed-loop system. We evaluate this approach in a pilot study (n=24), comparing NeuroChat to a standard LLM-based chatbot. Results indicate that NeuroChat enhances cognitive and subjective engagement but does not show an immediate effect on learning outcomes. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of real-time cognitive feedback in LLMs, highlighting new directions for adaptive learning, AI tutoring, and human-AI interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1207.5293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Probability Bracket Notation (PBN) is used to analyze multiple discrete random variables in static Bayesian Networks (BN) through probabilistic graphical models. We briefly introduce the definitions of probability distributions in multivariable systems and their presentations using PBN, then explore the well-known student BN. Our analysis includes calculating various joint, marginal, intermediate, and conditional probability distributions, completing homework assignments, examining relationships between variables (dependence, independence, and conditional independence), and disclosing the power of and restrictions on inserting P-identity operators. We also show the reasoning capabilities of the Student BN using bottom-up and top-down approaches, validated by Elvira software. In the last section, we discuss BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes continuous and discrete random variables, incorporates user-specific data, and offers tailored predictions through discrete-display (DD) nodes, serving as proxies for their continuous variable parents. Our investigation demonstrates that the PBN delivers a reliable and efficient approach for managing multiple variables in static Bayesian networks, a crucial aspect of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Statistical Verification with Imprecise Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A particularly challenging problem in AI safety is providing guarantees on the behavior of high-dimensional autonomous systems. Verification approaches centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on uncertainty quantification using concepts from imprecise probabilities. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we solve the allied problem of exploring the input set using active learning. The active learning uses an exhaustive neural-network verification tool Sherlock to collect samples. An evaluation on multiple physical simulators in the openAI gym Mujoco environments with reinforcement-learned controllers demonstrates that our approach can provide useful and scalable guarantees for high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Path To Gain Functional Transparency In Artificial Intelligence With Meaningful Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrating into various aspects of our daily lives, influencing decision-making processes in areas such as targeted advertising and matchmaking algorithms. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, ensuring their transparency and explainability becomes crucial. Functional transparency is a fundamental aspect of algorithmic decision-making systems, allowing stakeholders to comprehend the inner workings of these systems and enabling them to evaluate their fairness and accuracy. However, achieving functional transparency poses significant challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a design for user-centered compliant-by-design transparency in transparent systems. We emphasize that the development of transparent and explainable AI systems is a complex and multidisciplinary endeavor, necessitating collaboration among researchers from diverse fields such as computer science, artificial intelligence, ethics, law, and social science. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges associated with transparency in AI systems and proposing a user-centered design framework, we aim to facilitate the development of AI systems that are accountable, trustworthy, and aligned with societal values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a learning algorithm to overcome the limitations of a traditional backpropagation in resource-constrained environments: Solo Pass Embedded Learning Algorithm (SPELA). SPELA is equipped with rapid learning capabilities and operates with local loss functions to update weights, significantly saving on resources allocated to the propagation of gradients and storing computational graphs while being sufficiently accurate. Consequently, SPELA can closely match backpropagation with less data, computing, storage, and power. Moreover, SPELA can effectively fine-tune pre-trained image recognition models for new tasks. Our results indicate that SPELA can be an ideal candidate for learning in resource-constrained edge AI applications.</description>

      <title>Composing Reinforcement Learning Policies, with Formal Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework to controller design in environments with a two-level structure: a known high-level graph ("map") in which each vertex is populated by a Markov decision process, called a "room". The framework "separates concerns" by using different design techniques for low- and high-level tasks. We apply reactive synthesis for high-level tasks: given a specification as a logical formula over the high-level graph and a collection of low-level policies obtained together with "concise" latent structures, we construct a "planner" that selects which low-level policy to apply in each room. We develop a reinforcement learning procedure to train low-level policies on latent structures, which unlike previous approaches, circumvents a model distillation step. We pair the policy with probably approximately correct guarantees on its performance and on the abstraction quality, and lift these guarantees to the high-level task. These formal guarantees are the main advantage of the framework. Other advantages include scalability (rooms are large and their dynamics are unknown) and reusability of low-level policies. We demonstrate feasibility in challenging case studies where an agent navigates environments with moving obstacles and visual inputs.</description>

      <title>NLP-enabled Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using a Transformer-based Encoder-decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular trajectory data from geolocation telematics is vital for analyzing urban mobility patterns. Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</description>

      <title>BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.</description>

      <title>Flow of Reasoning:Training LLMs for Divergent Problem Solving with Minimal Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

      <description>arXiv:2406.14228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) has spurred a new trend in building LLM-based autonomous agents for solving complex tasks, especially multi-agent systems. Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing works are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits the functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically extend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve task-solving capability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend specialized agents to multi-agent systems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent frameworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary operators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple agents with diverse settings. Experimental results across various tasks show that EvoAgent can significantly enhance the task-solving capability of LLM-based agents, and can be generalized to any LLM-based agent framework to extend them into multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Humans now interact with a variety of digital minds, AI systems that appear to have mental faculties such as reasoning, emotion, and agency, and public figures are discussing the possibility of sentient AI. We present initial results from 2021 and 2023 for the nationally representative AI, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey (N = 3,500). Mind perception and moral concern for AI welfare were surprisingly high and significantly increased: in 2023, one in five U.S. adults believed some AI systems are currently sentient, and 38% supported legal rights for sentient AI. People became more opposed to building digital minds: in 2023, 63% supported banning smarter-than-human AI, and 69% supported banning sentient AI. The median 2023 forecast was that sentient AI would arrive in just five years. The development of safe and beneficial AI requires not just technical study but understanding the complex ways in which humans perceive and coexist with digital minds.</description>

      <title>Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Tokens: Byte-Pair Encoding on Quantized Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have made significant strides in integrating visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with effectively aligning these modalities. We introduce a novel image tokenizer that bridges this gap by applying the principle of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to visual data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on separate visual encoders, our method directly incorporates structural prior information into image tokens, mirroring the successful tokenization strategies used in text-only Large Language Models. This innovative approach enables Transformer models to more effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with limited training data. Leveraging this method, we develop Being-VL-0, a model that demonstrates superior performance across various benchmarks and shows promising scalability, potentially paving the way for more efficient and capable multimodal foundation models.</description>

      <title>Strong Preferences Affect the Robustness of Preference Models and Value Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Value alignment, which aims to ensure that large language models (LLMs) and other AI agents behave in accordance with human values, is critical for ensuring safety and trustworthiness of these systems. A key component of value alignment is the modeling of human preferences as a representation of human values. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of value alignment by examining the sensitivity of preference models. Specifically, we ask: how do changes in the probabilities of some preferences affect the predictions of these models for other preferences? To answer this question, we theoretically analyze the robustness of widely used preference models by examining their sensitivities to minor changes in preferences they model. Our findings reveal that, in the Bradley-Terry and the Placket-Luce model, the probability of a preference can change significantly as other preferences change, especially when these preferences are dominant (i.e., with probabilities near 0 or 1). We identify specific conditions where this sensitivity becomes significant for these models and discuss the practical implications for the robustness and safety of value alignment in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Analysis of Reasoning Trajectories: A Phase Space Approach to Understanding Valid and Invalid Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing multi-hop reasoning in language models through Hamiltonian mechanics. We map reasoning chains in embedding spaces to Hamiltonian systems, defining a function that balances reasoning progression (kinetic energy) against question relevance (potential energy). Analyzing reasoning chains from a question-answering dataset reveals that valid reasoning shows lower Hamiltonian energy values, representing an optimal trade-off between information gathering and targeted answering. While our framework offers complex visualization and quantification methods, the claimed ability to "steer" or "improve" reasoning algorithms requires more rigorous empirical validation, as the connection between physical systems and reasoning remains largely metaphorical. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals consistent geometric patterns distinguishing valid reasoning, suggesting this physics-inspired approach offers promising diagnostic tools and new perspectives on reasoning processes in large language models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable. Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in intelligent technologies have significantly improved navigation in complex traffic environments by enhancing environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions. Code is available in our open-source repository: https://github.com/ocean-luna/Explainable-Prediction.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has explored the memorization capacity of multi-head attention, but these findings are constrained by unrealistic limitations on the context size. We present a novel proof for language-based Transformers that extends the current hypothesis to any context size. Our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art by achieving more effective exact memorization with an attention layer, while also introducing the concept of approximate memorization of distributions. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our proposed bounds more accurately reflect the true memorization capacity of language models, and provide a precise comparison with prior work.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction in GPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models only trained to predict the next token, or do they implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We examine this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT-models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for in-distribution sequences. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled synthetic environment using the setup and rules of the Othello board game. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on synthetic data that only adheres to the game rules, oblivious to the goal of winning. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate moves that adhere to the game rules for sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.</description>

      <title>Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</description>

      <title>What Are Step-Level Reward Models Rewarding? Counterintuitive Findings from MCTS-Boosted Mathematical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Step-level reward models (SRMs) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning performance through process supervision or step-level preference alignment based on reinforcement learning. The performance of SRMs is pivotal, as they serve as critical guidelines, ensuring that each step in the reasoning process is aligned with desired outcomes. Recently, AlphaZero-like methods, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed for automatic step-level preference annotation, have proven particularly effective. However, the precise mechanisms behind the success of SRMs remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study delves into the counterintuitive aspects of SRMs, particularly focusing on MCTS-based approaches. Our findings reveal that the removal of natural language descriptions of thought processes has minimal impact on the efficacy of SRMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRMs are adept at assessing the complex logical coherence present in mathematical language while having difficulty in natural language. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward modeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined SRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated with diverse human communities, cultural alignment has emerged as a crucial element in their deployment. Most existing approaches treat cultural alignment as one-directional, embedding predefined cultural values from standardized surveys and repositories into AI systems. To challenge this perspective, we highlight research showing that humans' cultural values must be understood within the context of specific AI systems. We then use a GPT-4o case study to demonstrate that AI systems' cultural alignment depends on how humans structure their interactions with the system. Drawing on these findings, we argue that cultural alignment should be reframed as a bidirectional process: rather than merely imposing standardized values on AIs, we should query the human cultural values most relevant to each AI-based system and align it to these values through interaction frameworks shaped by human users.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data is essential in various applications, including climate modeling, healthcare monitoring, and financial analytics. Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.</description>

      <title>Why Vision Language Models Struggle with Visual Arithmetic? Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data.

      <title>Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled the integration of multiple modalities, including texts and images, within the large language model (LLM) framework. However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Statistical Scenario Modelling and Lookalike Distributions for Multi-Variate AI Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics for understanding how the use of AI affects aggregated risk. However, much AI safety literature focuses upon risks arising from AI models in isolation, lacking consideration of how modular use of AI affects risk distribution of workflow components or overall risk metrics. There is also a lack of statistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of absence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to the dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we address these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling (grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas and Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second, we show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used to estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods for benchmarking cumulative AI risk via risk analysis of a logistic scenario simulations.</description>

      <title>Enabling AI Scientists to Recognize Innovation: A Domain-Agnostic Algorithm for Assessing Novelty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), automating the generation and evaluation of novel research ideas is a key challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery. This paper presents Relative Neighbor Density (RND), a domain-agnostic algorithm for novelty assessment in research ideas that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by comparing an idea's local density with its adjacent neighbors' densities. We first developed a scalable methodology to create test set without expert labeling, addressing a fundamental challenge in novelty assessment. Using these test sets, we demonstrate that our RND algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in computer science (AUROC=0.820) and biomedical research (AUROC=0.765) domains. Most significantly, while SOTA models like Sonnet-3.7 and existing metrics show domain-specific performance degradation, RND maintains consistent accuracies across domains by its domain-invariant property, outperforming all benchmarks by a substantial margin (0.795 v.s. 0.597) on cross-domain evaluation. These results validate RND as a generalizable solution for automated novelty assessment in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Mapping AI Benchmark Data to Quantitative Risk Estimates Through Expert Elicitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature and multiple experts point to many potential risks from large language models (LLMs), but there are still very few direct measurements of the actual harms posed. AI risk assessment has so far focused on measuring the models' capabilities, but the capabilities of models are only indicators of risk, not measures of risk. Better modeling and quantification of AI risk scenarios can help bridge this disconnect and link the capabilities of LLMs to tangible real-world harm. This paper makes an early contribution to this field by demonstrating how existing AI benchmarks can be used to facilitate the creation of risk estimates. We describe the results of a pilot study in which experts use information from Cybench, an AI benchmark, to generate probability estimates. We show that the methodology seems promising for this purpose, while noting improvements that can be made to further strengthen its application in quantitative AI risk assessment.</description>

      <title>ToolFuzz -- Automated Agent Tool Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</description>

      <title>R1-Zero's "Aha Moment" in Visual Reasoning on a 2B Non-SFT Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In the context of evolving supply chain management, the significance of efficient inventory management has grown substantially for businesses. However, conventional manual and experience-based approaches often struggle to meet the complexities of modern market demands. This research introduces an intelligent inventory management system to address challenges related to inaccurate data, delayed monitoring, and overreliance on subjective experience in forecasting. The proposed system integrates bar code and distributed flutter application technologies for intelligent perception, alongside comprehensive big data analytics to enable data-driven decision-making. Through meticulous analysis, system design, critical technology exploration, and simulation validation, the effectiveness of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated. The intelligent system facilitates second-level monitoring, high-frequency checks, and artificial intelligence-driven forecasting, consequently enhancing the automation, precision, and intelligence of inventory management. This system contributes to cost reduction and optimized inventory sizes through accurate predictions and informed decisions, ultimately achieving a mutually beneficial scenario.

      <title>SupReMix: Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging Regression with Mixup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In medical image analysis, regression plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis. It enables quantitative measurements such as age prediction from structural imaging, cardiac function quantification, and molecular measurement from PET scans. While deep learning has shown promise for these tasks, most approaches focus solely on optimizing regression loss or model architecture, neglecting the quality of learned feature representations which are crucial for robust clinical predictions. Directly applying representation learning techniques designed for classification to regression often results in fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning for medical image regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects: ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we propose Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Imaging Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample) as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on six datasets spanning MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, and PET modalities, we demonstrate that SupReMix fosters continuous ordered representations, significantly improving regression performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Through AI-Clones: Enhancing Self-Perception and Presentation Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of AI-generated digital clones with self-images on enhancing perceptions and skills in online presentations. A mixed-design experiment with 44 international students compared self-recording videos (self-recording group) to AI-clone videos (AI-clone group) for online English presentation practice. AI-clone videos were generated using voice cloning, face swapping, lip-syncing, and body-language simulation, refining the repetition, filler words, and pronunciation of participants' original presentations. Through the lens of social comparison theory, the results showed that AI clones functioned as positive "role models" for facilitating social comparisons. When comparing the effects on self-perceptions, speech qualities, and self-kindness, the self-recording group showed an increase in pronunciation satisfaction. However, the AI-clone group exhibited greater self-kindness, broader observational coverage, and a meaningful transition from a corrective to an enhancive approach in self-critique. Moreover, machine-rated scores revealed immediate performance gains only within the AI-clone group. Considering individual differences, aligning interventions with participants' regulatory focus significantly enhanced their learning experience. These findings highlight the theoretical, practical, and ethical implications of AI clones in supporting emotional and cognitive skill development.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Accuracy Implications of Model Complexity and Integration in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving solution for distributed machine learning, particularly in heterogeneous FL settings where clients have varying computational capabilities and thus train models with different complexities compared to the server's model. However, FL is not without vulnerabilities: recent studies have shown that it is susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIA), which can compromise the privacy of client data. In this paper, we examine the intersection of these two aspects, heterogeneous FL and its privacy vulnerabilities, by focusing on the role of client model integration, the process through which the server integrates parameters from clients' smaller models into its larger model. To better understand this process, we first propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing heterogeneous FL methods and enables the design of seven novel heterogeneous FL model integration strategies. Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST vision datasets, we evaluate the privacy and accuracy trade-offs of these approaches under three types of MIAs. Our findings reveal significant differences in privacy leakage and performance depending on the integration method. Notably, introducing randomness in the model integration process enhances client privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy for both the clients and the server. This work provides quantitative light on the privacy-accuracy implications client model integration in heterogeneous FL settings, paving the way towards more secure and efficient FL systems.</description>

Abstract: Code optimization is a challenging task requiring a substantial level of expertise from developers. Nonetheless, this level of human capacity is not sufficient considering the rapid evolution of new hardware architectures and software environments. In light of this, recent research proposes adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automate the code optimization process. In this paper, we introduce PerfRL, an innovative framework designed to tackle the problem of code optimization. Our framework leverages the capabilities of small language models (SLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), facilitating a system where SLMs can assimilate feedback from their environment during the fine-tuning phase, notably through unit tests. When benchmarked against existing models, PerfRL demonstrates superior efficiency in terms of speed and computational resource usage, attributed to its reduced need for training steps and its compatibility with SLMs. Furthermore, it substantially diminishes the risk of logical and syntactical errors. To evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on the PIE dataset using a lightweight large language model (i.e., CodeT5) and a new reinforcement learning algorithm, namely RRHF. For evaluation purposes, we use a list of evaluation metrics related to optimization quality and speedup. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves similar or better results compared to state-of-the-art models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman-Informed Transformer</title>

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</description>

      <title>SCANIA Component X Dataset: A Real-World Multivariate Time Series Dataset for Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting failures and maintenance time in predictive maintenance is challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive real-world datasets, and among those available, few are of time series format. This paper introduces a real-world, multivariate time series dataset collected exclusively from a single anonymized engine component (Component X) across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications related to Component X, while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization. It is well-suited for a range of machine learning applications, including classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection, particularly in predictive maintenance scenarios. The dataset's large population size, diverse features (in the form of histograms and numerical counters), and temporal information make it a unique resource in the field. The objective of releasing this dataset is to give a broad range of researchers the possibility of working with real-world data from an internationally well-known company and introduce a standard benchmark to the predictive maintenance field, fostering reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Roq: Robust Query Optimization Based on a Risk-aware Learned Cost Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query optimizers in RDBMSs search for execution plans expected to be optimal for given queries. They use parameter estimates, often inaccurate, and make assumptions that may not hold in practice. Consequently, they may select plans that are suboptimal at runtime, if estimates and assumptions are not valid. Therefore, they do not sufficiently support robust query optimization. Using ML to improve data systems has shown promising results for query optimization. Inspired by this, we propose Robust Query Optimizer, (Roq), a holistic framework based on a risk-aware learning approach. Roq includes a novel formalization of the notion of robustness in the context of query optimization and a principled approach for its quantification and measurement based on approximate probabilistic ML. It also includes novel strategies and algorithms for query plan evaluation and selection. Roq includes a novel learned cost model that is designed to predict the cost of query execution and the associated risks and performs query optimization accordingly. We demonstrate that Roq provides significant improvements in robust query optimization compared with the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Detecting mental disorder on social media: a ChatGPT-augmented explainable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, the prevalence of depressive symptoms expressed on social media has raised serious concerns, necessitating advanced methodologies for timely detection. This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on the Power of Future Prediction in Partially Observable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning good representations of historical contexts is one of the core challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. While self-predictive auxiliary tasks have been shown to improve performance in fully observed settings, their role in partial observability remains underexplored. In this empirical study, we examine the effectiveness of self-predictive representation learning via future prediction, i.e., predicting next-step observations as an auxiliary task for learning history representations, especially in environments with long-term dependencies. We test the hypothesis that future prediction alone can produce representations that enable strong RL performance. To evaluate this, we introduce $\texttt{DRL}^2$, an approach that explicitly decouples representation learning from reinforcement learning, and compare this approach to end-to-end training across multiple benchmarks requiring long-term memory. Our findings provide evidence that this hypothesis holds across different network architectures, reinforcing the idea that future prediction performance serves as a reliable indicator of representation quality and contributes to improved RL performance.</description>

      <title>GraphEdit: Large Language Models for Graph Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Structure Learning (GSL) focuses on capturing intrinsic dependencies and interactions among nodes in graph-structured data by generating novel graph structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising GSL solutions, utilizing recursive message passing to encode node-wise inter-dependencies. However, many existing GSL methods heavily depend on explicit graph structural information as supervision signals, leaving them susceptible to challenges such as data noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose GraphEdit, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to learn complex node relationships in graph-structured data. By enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through instruction-tuning over graph structures, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with explicit graph structural information and enhance the reliability of graph structure learning. Our approach not only effectively denoises noisy connections but also identifies node-wise dependencies from a global perspective, providing a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphEdit across various settings. We have made our model implementation available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphEdit.</description>

      <title>CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing attendees to interact with it using real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Unifying Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human-in-Loop Interactive Socially-aware Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating human-filled spaces is crucial for the interactive social robots to support advanced services, such as cooperative carrying, which enables service provision in complex and crowded environments while adapting behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. However, existing social robot navigation planners face two major challenges: managing real-time user inputs and ensuring socially compliant behaviors in unfamiliar, zero-shot environments. In response, we introduce SALM, an interactive, human-in-loop Socially-Aware navigation Large Language Model framework that dynamically integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with large language model (LLM) capabilities. SALM leverages contextual semantic understanding from real-time human-robot interactions to convert high-level user commands into precise, low-level control actions. A high-level LLM module parses user input, guiding the simultaneous generation of navigation commands by both a large language navigation model (LNM) and a DRL-based navigation model (RLNM). A memory mechanism archives temporal data for continuous refinement, while a multi-step graph-of-thoughts inference-based large language feedback model adaptively fuses the strengths of both planning approaches. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SALM not only enhances navigational precision in crowded, dynamic environments but also significantly improves system adaptability, offering tailored behaviors that align with individual user preferences and real-time feedback.

      <title>Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</description>

      <title>Length-Controlled AlpacaEval: A Simple Way to Debias Automatic Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based auto-annotators have become a key component of the LLM development process due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human-based evaluation. However, these auto-annotators can introduce biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such as preference for longer outputs remain in existing automated evaluation metrics. We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling biases in auto-evaluations. As a real case study, we focus on reducing the length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for instruction-tuned LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality. Despite being highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor models that generate longer outputs. We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: "What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?" To achieve this, we first fit a generalized linear model to predict the biased auto-annotator's preferences based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity, but we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS Chatbot Arena from 0.94 to 0.98.</description>

      <title>How Do Recommendation Models Amplify Popularity Bias? An Analysis from the Spectral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12008v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias. When training a recommendation model on a typically long-tailed dataset, the model tends to not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it, resulting in over-representation of popular items in the recommendation lists. This study conducts comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses to expose the root causes of this phenomenon, yielding two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal spectrum of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension collapse phenomenon amplifies the relative prominence of the principal spectrum, thereby intensifying the popularity bias. Building on these insights, we propose a novel debiasing strategy that leverages a spectral norm regularizer to penalize the magnitude of the principal singular value. We have developed an efficient algorithm to expedite the calculation of the spectral norm by exploiting the spectral property of the score matrix. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing paradigms have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Folded Context Condensation in Path Integral Formalism for Infinite Context Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.</description>

      <title>LLMs can Find Mathematical Reasoning Mistakes by Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mixture of Experts: An Auto-Tuning Approach for Efficient Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has been widely employed to enhance the efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models, yielding promising results.However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language, and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks, and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by activating fewer parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DynMoE.</description>

      <title>LiteNeXt: A Novel Lightweight ConvMixer-based Model with Self-embedding Representation Parallel for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation task, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been introduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy close to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like Transformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data, and are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder, decoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters. Additionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger data, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In this study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt, based on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical image segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of parameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To handle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in medical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help effectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background. Additionally, the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique is proposed as an innovative data augmentation strategy that utilizes the network architecture itself for self-learning augmentation, enhancing feature extraction robustness without external data. Experiments on public datasets including Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, Sunnybrook, and Lung X-ray data show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures. Our code is released at: https://github.com/tranngocduvnvp/LiteNeXt.</description>

      <title>VoCoT: Unleashing Visually Grounded Multi-Step Reasoning in Large Multi-Modal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their effectiveness in handling complex tasks has been limited by the prevailing single-step reasoning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes VoCoT, a multi-step Visually grounded object-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework tailored for inference with LMMs. VoCoT is characterized by two key features: (1) object-centric reasoning paths that revolve around cross-modal shared object-level information, and (2) visually grounded representation of object concepts in a multi-modal interleaved and aligned manner, which effectively bridges the modality gap within LMMs during long-term generation. To adapt LMMs in reasoning with VoCoT, we further construct an instruction-tuning dataset. By combining VoCoT with the prevalent open-source LMM architectures, we develop a VoCoT-based model, VolCano. With only 7B parameters and limited input image resolution, VolCano demonstrates excellent performance across various scenarios. In benchmarks like CLEVR and EmbSpatial, which highly require complex reasoning capabilities, VolCano outperforms SOTA models, including powerful GPT-4V. Related code, data and models are released in https://github.com/RupertLuo/VoCoT.</description>

      <title>Locking Machine Learning Models into Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed; for example, it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper, we take a different approach and investigate the feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap \emph{locking of machine learning models into specific hardware}. We demonstrate that \emph{locking} mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, making such models incompatible with quantization, or tying the model's operation to specific characteristics of hardware, such as the number of clock cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</description>

      <title>FFNet: MetaMixer-based Efficient Convolutional Mixer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer, composed of self-attention and Feed-Forward Network, has revolutionized the landscape of network design across various vision tasks. While self-attention is extensively explored as a key factor in performance, FFN has received little attention. FFN is a versatile operator seamlessly integrated into nearly all AI models to effectively harness rich representations. Recent works also show that FFN functions like key-value memories. Thus, akin to the query-key-value mechanism within self-attention, FFN can be viewed as a memory network, where the input serves as query and the two projection weights operate as keys and values, respectively. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the importance lies in query-key-value framework itself for competitive performance. To verify this, we propose converting self-attention into a more FFN-like efficient token mixer with only convolutions while retaining query-key-value framework, namely FFNification. Specifically, FFNification replaces query-key-value interactions with large kernel convolutions and adopts GELU activation function instead of softmax. The derived token mixer, FFNified attention, serves as key-value memories for detecting locally distributed spatial patterns, and operates in the opposite dimension to the ConvNeXt block within each corresponding sub-operation of the query-key-value framework. Building upon the above two modules, we present a family of Fast-Forward Networks (FFNet). Despite being composed of only simple operators, FFNet outperforms sophisticated and highly specialized methods in each domain, with notable efficiency gains. These results validate our hypothesis, leading us to propose MetaMixer, a general mixer architecture that does not specify sub-operations within the query-key-value framework.</description>

      <title>Bayesian WeakS-to-Strong from Text Classification to Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</description>

      <title>How to Strategize Human Content Creation in the Era of GenAI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) will have significant impact on content creation platforms. In this paper, we study the dynamic competition between a GenAI and a human contributor. Unlike the human, the GenAI's content only improves when more contents are created by the human over time; however, GenAI has the advantage of generating content at a lower cost. We study the algorithmic problem in this dynamic competition model about how the human contributor can maximize her utility when competing against the GenAI for content generation over a set of topics. In time-sensitive content domains (e.g., news or pop music creation) where contents' value diminishes over time, we show that there is no polynomial time algorithm for finding the human's optimal (dynamic) strategy, unless the randomized exponential time hypothesis is false. Fortunately, we are able to design a polynomial time algorithm that naturally cycles between myopically optimizing over a short time window and pausing and provably guarantees an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$. We then turn to time-insensitive content domains where contents do not lose their value (e.g., contents on history facts). Interestingly, we show that this setting permits a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the human's utility in the long run. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the advantage of our algorithms in comparison to a collection of baselines.</description>

      <title>CorDA: Context-Oriented Decomposition Adaptation of Large Language Models for Task-Aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods build adapters widely agnostic of the context of downstream task to learn, or the context of important knowledge to maintain. As a result, there is often a performance gap compared to full-parameter fine-tuning, and meanwhile the fine-tuned model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. In this paper, we propose CorDA, a Context-oriented Decomposition Adaptation method that builds learnable task-aware adapters from weight decomposition oriented by the context of downstream task or the world knowledge to maintain. Concretely, we collect a few data samples, and perform singular value decomposition for each linear layer of a pre-trained LLM multiplied by the covariance matrix of the input activation using these samples. The inverse of the covariance matrix is multiplied with the decomposed components to reconstruct the original weights. By doing so, the context of the representative samples is captured through deciding the factorizing orientation. Our method enables two options, the knowledge-preserved adaptation and the instruction-previewed adaptation. For the former, we use question-answering samples to obtain the covariance matrices, and use the decomposed components with the smallest $r$ singular values to initialize a learnable adapter, with the others frozen such that the world knowledge is better preserved. For the latter, we use the instruction data from the fine-tuning task, such as math or coding, to orientate the decomposition and train the largest $r$ components that most correspond to the task to learn. We conduct extensive experiments on Math, Code, and Instruction Following tasks.</description>

      <title>Which Backbone to Use: A Resource-efficient Domain Specific Comparison for Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contemporary computer vision applications, particularly image classification, architectural backbones pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet are commonly employed as feature extractors. Despite the widespread use of these pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there remains a gap in understanding the performance of various resource-efficient backbones across diverse domains and dataset sizes. Our study systematically evaluates multiple lightweight, pre-trained CNN backbones under consistent training settings across a variety of datasets, including natural images, medical images, galaxy images, and remote sensing images. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid machine learning practitioners in selecting the most suitable backbone for their specific problem, especially in scenarios involving small datasets where fine-tuning a pre-trained network is crucial. Even though attention-based architectures are gaining popularity, we observed that they tend to perform poorly under low data finetuning tasks compared to CNNs. We also observed that some CNN architectures such as ConvNeXt, RegNet and EfficientNet performs well compared to others on a diverse set of domains consistently. Our findings provide actionable insights into the performance trade-offs and effectiveness of different backbones, facilitating informed decision-making in model selection for a broad spectrum of computer vision domains.

      <title>Learning in Feature Spaces via Coupled Covariances: Asymmetric Kernel SVD and Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g., in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Manipulation using Behavior Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many manipulation tasks pose a challenge since they depend on non-visual environmental information that can only be determined after sustained physical interaction has already begun. This is particularly relevant for effort-sensitive, dynamics-dependent tasks such as tightening a valve. To perform these tasks safely and reliably, robots must be able to quickly adapt in response to unexpected changes during task execution, and should also learn from past experience to better inform future decisions. Humans can intuitively respond and adapt their manipulation strategy to suit such problems, but representing and implementing such behaviors for robots remains a challenge. In this work we show how this can be achieved within the framework of behavior trees. We present the adaptive behavior tree, a scalable and generalizable behavior tree design that enables a robot to quickly adapt to and learn from both visual and non-visual observations during task execution, preempting task failure or switching to a different manipulation strategy. The adaptive behavior tree selects the manipulation strategy that is predicted to optimize task performance, and learns from past experience to improve these predictions for future attempts. We test our approach on a variety of tasks commonly found in industry; the adaptive behavior tree demonstrates safety, robustness (100% success rate) and efficiency in task completion (up to 36% task speedup from the baseline).</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Assume People are More Rational than We Really are</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17055v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o &amp; 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B &amp; 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</description>

      <title>Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states. However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.</description>

      <title>KPC-cF: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Implicit-Feature Alignment with Corpus Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00342v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigations into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Korean industrial reviews are notably lacking in the existing literature. Our research proposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource languages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating translated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on translated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we applied LaBSE and \MSP{}-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit feature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through additional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset gaps and facilitates feature alignment with minimal resources. By implementing alignment pipelines, our approach aims to leverage high-resource datasets to develop reliable predictive and refined models within corporate or individual communities in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our framework showed an approximately 3\% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We will release our dataset and code for Korean ABSA, at this link.</description>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a technique that enables neural networks to constantly adapt to their dynamic surroundings. Despite being overlooked for a long time, this technology can considerably address the customized needs of users in edge devices. Actually, most CL methods require huge resource consumption by the training behavior to acquire generalizability among all tasks for delaying forgetting regardless of edge scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a compact algorithm called LightCL, which evaluates and compresses the redundancy of already generalized components in structures of the neural network. Specifically, we consider two factors of generalizability, learning plasticity and memory stability, and design metrics of both to quantitatively assess generalizability of neural networks during CL. This evaluation shows that generalizability of different layers in a neural network exhibits a significant variation. Thus, we $\textit{Maintain Generalizability}$ by freezing generalized parts without the resource-intensive training process and $\textit{Memorize Feature Patterns}$ by stabilizing feature extracting of previous tasks to enhance generalizability for less-generalized parts with a little extra memory, which is far less than the reduction by freezing. Experiments illustrate that LightCL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and reduces at most $\textbf{6.16$\times$}$ memory footprint. We also verify the effectiveness of LightCL on the edge device.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models have recently been applied to text annotation tasks from social sciences, equalling or surpassing the performance of human workers at a fraction of the cost. However, no inquiry has yet been made on the impact of prompt selection on labelling accuracy. In this study, we show that performance greatly varies between prompts, and we apply the method of automatic prompt optimization to systematically craft high quality prompts. We also provide the community with a simple, browser-based implementation of the method at https://prompt-ultra.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Token-Supervised Value Models for Enhancing Mathematical Problem-Solving Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of test-time compute search strategies to improve the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the need for building robust verifiers has become increasingly important. However, all these inference strategies rely on existing verifiers originally designed for Best-of-N search, which makes them sub-optimal for tree search techniques at test time. During tree search, existing verifiers can only offer indirect and implicit assessments of partial solutions or under-value prospective intermediate steps, thus resulting in the premature pruning of promising intermediate steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose token-supervised value models (TVMs) - a new class of verifiers that assign each token a probability that reflects the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. This new token-level supervision enables TVMs to directly and explicitly evaluate partial solutions, effectively distinguishing between promising and incorrect intermediate steps during tree search at test time. Experimental results demonstrate that combining tree-search-based inference strategies with TVMs significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in mathematical problem-solving tasks, surpassing the performance of existing verifiers.</description>

      <title>DreamStory: Open-Domain Story Visualization by LLM-Guided Multi-Subject Consistent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.</description>

      <title>Answer, Assemble, Ace: Understanding How LMs Answer Multiple Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is a key competence of performant transformer language models that is tested by mainstream benchmarks. However, recent evidence shows that models can have quite a range of performance, particularly when the task format is diversified slightly (such as by shuffling answer choice order). In this work we ask: how do successful models perform formatted MCQA? We employ vocabulary projection and activation patching methods to localize key hidden states that encode relevant information for predicting the correct answer. We find that the prediction of a specific answer symbol is causally attributed to a few middle layers, and specifically their multi-head self-attention mechanisms. We show that subsequent layers increase the probability of the predicted answer symbol in vocabulary space, and that this probability increase is associated with a sparse set of attention heads with unique roles. We additionally uncover differences in how different models adjust to alternative symbols. Finally, we demonstrate that a synthetic task can disentangle sources of model error to pinpoint when a model has learned formatted MCQA, and show that logit differences between answer choice tokens continue to grow over the course of training.</description>

      <title>When narrower is better: the narrow width limit of Bayesian parallel branching neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infinite width limit of random neural networks is known to result in Neural Networks as Gaussian Process (NNGP) (Lee et al. (2018)), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. (2019)). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Neural Network (BPB-NN), an architecture that resembles neural networks with residual blocks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-NN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-NN in the narrow width limit is generally superior to or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. We demonstrate such phenomenon primarily in the branching graph neural networks, where each branch represents a different order of convolutions of the graph; we also extend the results to other more general architectures such as the residual-MLP and demonstrate that the narrow width effect is a general feature of the branching networks. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</description>

      <title>Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Language Model Training on Data Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs.</description>

      <title>TaskEval: Assessing Difficulty of Code Generation Tasks for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code-related tasks like code generation, but benchmark evaluations often overlook task characteristics, such as difficulty. Moreover, benchmarks are usually built using tasks described with one single prompt, despite the formulation of prompts having a profound impact on the outcome. This paper introduces a generalist approach, TaskEval, a framework using diverse prompts and Item Response Theory (IRT) to efficiently assess LLMs' capabilities and benchmark task characteristics, improving the understanding of their performance.
  Using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, as well as 5 code generation LLMs, we show that TaskEval is capable of characterizing the properties of tasks. Using topic analysis, we identify and analyze the tasks of respectively 17 and 21 topics within the benchmarks. We also cross-analyze tasks' characteristics with programming constructs (e.g., variable assignment, conditions, etc.) used by LLMs, emphasizing some patterns with tasks' difficulty. Finally, we conduct a comparison between the difficulty assessment of tasks by human-annotators and LLMs. Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, TaskEval can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs. The tasks' characteristics can be used to identify shortcomings within existing benchmarks. This could be used to generate additional related tasks for the evaluation or improvement of LLM.</description>

      <title>UrBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Multi-View Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent evaluations of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have explored their capabilities in various domains, with only few benchmarks specifically focusing on urban environments. Moreover, existing urban benchmarks have been limited to evaluating LMMs with basic region-level urban tasks under singular views, leading to incomplete evaluations of LMMs' abilities in urban environments. To address these issues, we present UrBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating LMMs in complex multi-view urban scenarios. UrBench contains 11.6K meticulously curated questions at both region-level and role-level that cover 4 task dimensions: Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding, and Object Understanding, totaling 14 task types. In constructing UrBench, we utilize data from existing datasets and additionally collect data from 11 cities, creating new annotations using a cross-view detection-matching method. With these images and annotations, we then integrate LMM-based, rule-based, and human-based methods to construct large-scale high-quality questions. Our evaluations on 21 LMMs show that current LMMs struggle in the urban environments in several aspects. Even the best performing GPT-4o lags behind humans in most tasks, ranging from simple tasks such as counting to complex tasks such as orientation, localization and object attribute recognition, with an average performance gap of 17.4%. Our benchmark also reveals that LMMs exhibit inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, especially with respect to understanding cross-view relations.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>AI Meets the Classroom: When Do Large Language Models Harm Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of large language models (LLMs) in education is debated: Previous research shows that LLMs can help as well as hurt learning. In two pre-registered and incentivized laboratory experiments, we find no effect of LLMs on overall learning outcomes. In exploratory analyses and a field study, we provide evidence that the effect of LLMs on learning outcomes depends on usage behavior. Students who substitute some of their learning activities with LLMs (e.g., by generating solutions to exercises) increase the volume of topics they can learn about but decrease their understanding of each topic. Students who complement their learning activities with LLMs (e.g., by asking for explanations) do not increase topic volume but do increase their understanding. We also observe that LLMs widen the gap between students with low and high prior knowledge. While LLMs show great potential to improve learning, their use must be tailored to the educational context and students' needs.</description>

      <title>Hier-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Hier-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our \MethodName{} outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/LeeBY68/Hier-SLAM</description>

      <title>A Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Pipeline for Dialogue Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is crucial for understanding user needs and executing appropriate system actions in task-oriented dialogues. Majority of existing DST methods are designed to work within predefined ontologies and assume the availability of gold domain labels, struggling with adapting to new slots values. While Large Language Models (LLMs)-based systems show promising zero-shot DST performance, they either require extensive computational resources or they underperform existing fully-trained systems, limiting their practicality. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot, open-vocabulary system that integrates domain classification and DST in a single pipeline. Our approach includes reformulating DST as a question-answering task for less capable models and employing self-refining prompts for more adaptable ones. Our system does not rely on fixed slot values defined in the ontology allowing the system to adapt dynamically. We compare our approach with existing SOTA, and show that it provides up to 20% better Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA) over previous methods on datasets like Multi-WOZ 2.1, with up to 90% fewer requests to the LLM API.</description>

      <title>Robi Butler: Multimodal Remote Interaction with a Household Robot Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine a future when we can Zoom-call a robot to manage household chores remotely. This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.</description>

      <title>Provably Accurate Shapley Value Estimation via Leverage Score Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally introduced in game theory, Shapley values have emerged as a central tool in explainable machine learning, where they are used to attribute model predictions to specific input features. However, computing Shapley values exactly is expensive: for a general model with $n$ features, $O(2^n)$ model evaluations are necessary. To address this issue, approximation algorithms are widely used. One of the most popular is the Kernel SHAP algorithm, which is model agnostic and remarkably effective in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, Kernel SHAP has no strong non-asymptotic complexity guarantees. We address this issue by introducing Leverage SHAP, a light-weight modification of Kernel SHAP that provides provably accurate Shapley value estimates with just $O(n\log n)$ model evaluations. Our approach takes advantage of a connection between Shapley value estimation and agnostic active learning by employing leverage score sampling, a powerful regression tool. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we show that Leverage SHAP consistently outperforms even the highly optimized implementation of Kernel SHAP available in the ubiquitous SHAP library [Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017].</description>

      <title>A Survey on Point-of-Interest Recommendation: Models, Architectures, and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and Location-Based Social Networks has led to a massive influx of spatio-temporal data, creating unparalleled opportunities for enhancing Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. These advanced POI systems are crucial for enriching user experiences, enabling personalized interactions, and optimizing decision-making processes in the digital landscape. However, existing surveys tend to focus on traditional approaches and few of them delve into cutting-edge developments, emerging architectures, as well as security considerations in POI recommendations. To address this gap, our survey stands out by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date review of POI recommendation systems, covering advancements in models, architectures, and security aspects. We systematically examine the transition from traditional models to advanced techniques such as large language models. Additionally, we explore the architectural evolution from centralized to decentralized and federated learning systems, highlighting the improvements in scalability and privacy. Furthermore, we address the increasing importance of security, examining potential vulnerabilities and privacy-preserving approaches. Our taxonomy provides a structured overview of the current state of POI recommendation, while we also identify promising directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.</description>

      <title>Agent Security Bench (ASB): Formalizing and Benchmarking Attacks and Defenses in LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Action Sequence Learning for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a universal policy architecture that performs well across diverse robots and task configurations remains a key challenge. In this work, we address this by representing robot actions as sequential data and generating actions through autoregressive sequence modeling. Existing autoregressive architectures generate end-effector waypoints sequentially as word tokens in language modeling, which are limited to low-frequency control tasks. Unlike language, robot actions are heterogeneous and often include continuous values -- such as joint positions, 2D pixel coordinates, and end-effector poses -- which are not easily suited for language-based modeling. Based on this insight, we introduce a straightforward enhancement: we extend causal transformers' single-token prediction to support predicting a variable number of tokens in a single step through our Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT). This enhancement enables robust performance across diverse tasks of various control frequencies, greater efficiency by having fewer autoregression steps, and lead to a hybrid action sequence design by mixing different types of actions and using a different chunk size for each action type. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) architecture, which solves manipulation tasks by generating hybrid action sequences. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that ARP, as a universal architecture, matches or outperforms the environment-specific state-of-the-art in all tested benchmarks, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Videos of our real robot demonstrations, all source code and the pretrained models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Leverage Knowledge Graph and Large Language Model for Law Article Recommendation: A Case Study of Chinese Criminal Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Court efficiency is vital for social stability. However, in most countries around the world, the grassroots courts face case backlogs, with decisions relying heavily on judicial personnel's cognitive labor, lacking intelligent tools to improve efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an efficient law article recommendation approach utilizing a Knowledge Graph (KG) and a Large Language Model (LLM). Firstly, we propose a Case-Enhanced Law Article Knowledge Graph (CLAKG) as a database to store current law statutes, historical case information, and correspondence between law articles and historical cases. Additionally, we introduce an automated CLAKG construction method based on LLM. On this basis, we propose a closed-loop law article recommendation method. Finally, through a series of experiments using judgment documents from the website "China Judgements Online", we have improved the accuracy of law article recommendation in cases from 0.549 to 0.694, demonstrating that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>FLOPS: Forward Learning with OPtimal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the limitations of backpropagation, perturbation-based gradient computation methods have recently gained focus for learning with only forward passes, also referred to as queries. Conventional forward learning consumes enormous queries on each data point for accurate gradient estimation through Monte Carlo sampling, which hinders the scalability of those algorithms. However, not all data points deserve equal queries for gradient estimation. In this paper, we study the problem of improving the forward learning efficiency from a novel perspective: how to reduce the gradient estimation variance with minimum cost? For this, we propose to allocate the optimal number of queries over each data in one batch during training to achieve a good balance between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, with a simplified proxy objective and a reparameterization technique, we derive a novel plug-and-play query allocator with minimal parameters. Theoretical results are carried out to verify its optimality. We conduct extensive experiments for fine-tuning Vision Transformers on various datasets and further deploy the allocator to two black-box applications: prompt tuning and multimodal alignment for foundation models. All findings demonstrate that our proposed allocator significantly enhances the scalability of forward-learning algorithms, paving the way for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Active Inference Agents for Heterogeneous and Lifelong Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling heterogeneity and unpredictability are two core problems in pervasive computing. The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with varying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive system that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on adaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or low-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of specific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained control over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in dynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference (AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that permits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of manually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt to environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with an extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated learning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical testbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The results provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to environmental changes. In particular, the AIF agent can balance competing SLOs in resource heterogeneous environments to ensure up to 98% fulfillment rate.</description>

      <title>Core Knowledge Deficits in Multi-Modal Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive abilities over high level perception and reasoning, their robustness in the wild still lags behind humans and exhibits diminished efficacy on simple tasks that are intuitive for humans. We examine the hypothesis that these deficiencies stem from the absence of core knowledge, rudimentary cognitive abilities innate to humans from early childhood. To probe core knowledge representation in MLLMs, we draw from developmental cognitive sciences and develop a large-scale benchmark, CoreCognition dataset, encompassing 12 core cognitive concepts. We evaluate 219 models with 10 different prompts, leading to a total of 2409 data points for analysis. Our findings reveal core knowledge deficits in early developed core abilities while models demonstrate human comparable performance in high level cognition. Moreover, we find that low level abilities show little to no scaling, in stark contrast to high level abilities. Finally, we introduce an evaluation technique, Concept Hacking, through which we demonstrate that MLLMs do not genuinely advance toward core knowledge but instead rely on illusory understanding and shortcut learning as they scale.

      <title>From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations from unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</description>

      <title>TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Closed-form merging of parameter-efficient modules for Federated Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a crucial technique in Deep Learning, enabling the integration of multiple models into a unified system while preserving perfor-mance and scalability. In this respect, the compositional properties of low-rank adaptation techniques (e.g., LoRA) have proven beneficial, as simple averaging LoRA modules yields a single model that mostly integrates the capabilities of all individual modules. Building on LoRA, we take a step further by imposing that the merged model matches the responses of all learned modules. Solving this objective in closed form yields an indeterminate system with A and B as unknown variables, indicating the existence of infinitely many closed-form solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce LoRM, an alternating optimization strategy that trains one LoRA matrix at a time. This allows solving for each unknown variable individually, thus finding a unique solution. We apply our proposed methodology to Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL), ensuring alignment of model responses both between clients and across tasks. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a range of FCIL scenarios. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at github.com/aimagelab/fed-mammoth.</description>

Abstract: Controlled generation with pre-trained Diffusion and Flow Matching models has vast applications. One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior distribution. Along this line, some recent work showed the effectiveness of guiding flow model by differentiating through its ODE sampling process. Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3). We show that existing backprop-through-ODE methods can be interpreted as special cases of Euclidean OC-Flow. OC-Flow achieved superior performance in extensive experiments on text-guided image manipulation, conditional molecule generation, and all-atom peptide design.</description>

      <title>SmartRAG: Jointly Learn RAG-Related Tasks From the Environment Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18141</link>

Abstract: RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these modules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that incorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal performance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called \textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy network can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a query rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an answer generator that produces the final response with/without the observations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a reinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the system to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When jointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are working and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system. Empirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve better performance than separately optimized counterparts.</description>

      <title>R-LLaVA: Improving Med-VQA Understanding through Visual Region of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20327v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), yet prevalent studies often interpret images holistically, overlooking the visual regions of interest that may contain crucial information, potentially aligning with a doctor's prior knowledge that can be incorporated with minimal annotations (e.g., bounding boxes). To address this gap, this paper introduces R-LLaVA, designed to enhance biomedical VQA understanding by integrating simple medical annotations as prior knowledge directly into the image space through CLIP. These annotated visual regions of interest are then fed into the LLaVA model during training, aiming to enrich the model's understanding of biomedical queries. Experimental evaluation on four standard Med-VQA datasets demonstrates R-LLaVA's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. Additionally, to verify the model's capability in visual comprehension, a novel multiple-choice medical visual understanding dataset is introduced, confirming the positive impact of focusing on visual regions of interest in advancing biomedical VQA understanding.</description>

      <title>Efficient Feature Extraction and Classification Architecture for MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection and Localization</title>

Abstract: Uncontrolled cell division in the brain is what gives rise to brain tumors. If the tumor size increases by more than half, there is little hope for the patient's recovery. This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a CNN was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved and we also localized the tumor regions from the unannotated images using GradCAM, a deep learning explainability tool. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features into different ML models. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient.</description>

      <title>Clinical Evaluation of Medical Image Synthesis: A Case Study in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy</title>

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) can transform the way clinical medicine is delivered by overcoming privacy barriers that currently render clinical data sharing difficult. This is the key to accelerating the development of digital tools contributing to enhanced patient safety. Such tools include robust data-driven clinical decision support systems, and example-based digital training tools that will enable healthcare professionals to improve their diagnostic performance for enhanced patient safety. This study focuses on the clinical evaluation of medical SDG, with a proof-of-concept investigation on diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. Its scientific contributions include a) a novel protocol for the systematic Clinical Evaluation of Medical Image Synthesis (CEMIS); b) a novel variational autoencoder-based model for the generation of high-resolution synthetic WCE images; and c) a comprehensive evaluation of the synthetic images using the CEMIS protocol by 10 international WCE specialists, in terms of image quality, diversity, and realism, as well as their utility for clinical decision-making. The results show that TIDE-II generates clinically plausible, very realistic WCE images, of improved quality compared to relevant state-of-the-art generative models. Concludingly, CEMIS can serve as a reference for future research on medical image-generation techniques, while the adaptation/extension of the architecture of TIDE-II to other imaging domains can be promising.</description>

      <title>CycleResearcher: Improving Automated Research via Automated Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities. The code, dataset and model weight are released at https://wengsyx.github.io/Researcher/.</description>

      <title>IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLBreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.</description>

      <title>log-RRIM: Yield Prediction via Local-to-global Reaction Representation Learning and Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields is crucial for optimizing organic synthesis, potentially reducing time and resources spent on experimentation. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions without conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative graph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction yields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention mechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers. This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations. log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium to high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor. The framework's sophisticated modeling of reactant-reagent interactions and precise capture of molecular fragment contributions make it a valuable tool for reaction planning and optimization in chemical synthesis. The data and codes of log-RRIM are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/Yield_log_RRIM.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills and of (modes) offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.</description>

      <title>Imagine-2-Drive: Leveraging High-Fidelity World Models via Multi-Modal Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World Model-based Reinforcement Learning (WMRL) enables sample efficient policy learning by reducing the need for online interactions which can potentially be costly and unsafe, especially for autonomous driving. However, existing world models often suffer from low prediction fidelity and compounding one-step errors, leading to policy degradation over long horizons. Additionally, traditional RL policies, often deterministic or single Gaussian-based, fail to capture the multi-modal nature of decision-making in complex driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Imagine-2-Drive, a novel WMRL framework that integrates a high-fidelity world model with a multi-modal diffusion-based policy actor. It consists of two key components: DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based world model that generates future observations simultaneously, mitigating error accumulation, and DPA (Diffusion Policy Actor), a diffusion-based policy that models diverse and multi-modal trajectory distributions. By training DPA within DiffDreamer, our method enables robust policy learning with minimal online interactions. We evaluate our method in CARLA using standard driving benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms prior world model baselines, improving Route Completion and Success Rate by 15% and 20% respectively.</description>

      <title>Just Leaf It: Accelerating Diffusion Classifiers with Hierarchical Class Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, celebrated for their generative capabilities, have recently demonstrated surprising effectiveness in image classification tasks by using Bayes' theorem. Yet, current diffusion classifiers must evaluate every label candidate for each input, creating high computational costs that impede their use in large-scale applications. To address this limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Classifier (HDC) that exploits hierarchical label structures or well-defined parent-child relationships in the dataset. By pruning irrelevant high-level categories and refining predictions only within relevant subcategories (leaf nodes and sub-trees), HDC reduces the total number of class evaluations. As a result, HDC can speed up inference by as much as 60% while preserving and sometimes even improving classification accuracy. In summary, our work provides a tunable control mechanism between speed and precision, making diffusion-based classification more feasible for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Adversarial Vulnerabilities of Vision-Language-Action Models in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</description>

      <title>MMGenBench: Fully Automatically Evaluating LMMs from the Text-to-Image Generation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities. However, current benchmarks predominantly focus on image comprehension in specific domains, and these benchmarks are labor-intensive to construct. Moreover, their answers tend to be brief, making it difficult to assess the ability of LMMs to generate detailed descriptions of images. To address these limitations, we propose the MMGenBench-Pipeline, a straightforward and fully automated evaluation pipeline. This involves generating textual descriptions from input images, using these descriptions to create auxiliary images via text-to-image generative models, and then comparing the original and generated images. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of MMGenBench-Pipeline, we design MMGenBench-Test, evaluating LMMs across 13 distinct image patterns, and MMGenBench-Domain, focusing on generative image performance. A thorough evaluation involving over 50 popular LMMs demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of both the pipeline and benchmark. Our observations indicate that numerous LMMs excelling in existing benchmarks fail to adequately complete the basic tasks related to image understanding and description. This finding highlights the substantial potential for performance improvement in current LMMs and suggests avenues for future model optimization. Concurrently, MMGenBench-Pipeline can efficiently assess the performance of LMMs across diverse domains using only image inputs.</description>

      <title>Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</description>

      <title>CODE-CL: Conceptor-Based Gradient Projection for Deep Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15594v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Training and Evaluating Language Models with Template-based Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving, due in part to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for training sophisticated reasoning abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel approach that leverages LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which are then used to synthesize a vast array of high-quality problems and solutions. Leveraging TDG, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset comprising over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems--each accompanied by code-based and natural language solutions--with the potential to generate an effectively unlimited number more. This dataset alleviates the scarcity of large-scale mathematical datasets and serves as a valuable resource for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs in mathematical reasoning. Our method not only enables the generation of virtually infinite data but also elevates data augmentation to a new level by using GPT-4 for meta-template generation, ensuring diverse and high-quality problem structures. The TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/TemplateGSM. The code is available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.</description>

      <title>Reverse Thinking Makes LLMs Stronger Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</description>

      <title>FonTS: Text Rendering with Typography and Style Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual text rendering are widespread in various real-world applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent progress in diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still encounter challenges like inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word-level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these problems by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce typography control fine-tuning (TC-FT), an parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (on $5\%$ key parameters) with enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enables precise word-level application of typographic features. To further address style inconsistency in text rendering, we propose a text-agnostic style control adapter (SCA) that prevents content leakage while enhancing style consistency. To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the data synthesis pipeline and proposed the first word-level controllable dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in text rendering tasks. The datasets and models will be available for academic use.</description>

      <title>Motion Dreamer: Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning for Physically Coherent Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown promise for generating future scenarios, critical for planning and control in autonomous driving and embodied intelligence. However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

      <title>Second FRCSyn-onGoing: Winning Solutions and Post-Challenge Analysis to Improve Face Recognition with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data is gaining increasing popularity for face recognition technologies, mainly due to the privacy concerns and challenges associated with obtaining real data, including diverse scenarios, quality, and demographic groups, among others. It also offers some advantages over real data, such as the large amount of data that can be generated or the ability to customize it to adapt to specific problem-solving needs. To effectively use such data, face recognition models should also be specifically designed to exploit synthetic data to its fullest potential. In order to promote the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and investigate the application of synthetic data to better train face recognition systems, we introduce the 2nd FRCSyn-onGoing challenge, based on the 2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn), originally launched at CVPR 2024. This is an ongoing challenge that provides researchers with an accessible platform to benchmark i) the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and ii) novel face recognition systems that are specifically proposed to take advantage of synthetic data. We focus on exploring the use of synthetic data both individually and in combination with real data to solve current challenges in face recognition such as demographic bias, domain adaptation, and performance constraints in demanding situations, such as age disparities between training and testing, changes in the pose, or occlusions. Very interesting findings are obtained in this second edition, including a direct comparison with the first one, in which synthetic databases were restricted to DCFace and GANDiffFace.</description>

      <title>Pretrained Reversible Generation as Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>LayoutVLM: Differentiable Optimization of 3D Layout via Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, enabling intuitive understanding and manipulation of objects in three-dimensional space. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with simple tasks such as arranging 3D assets in space according to open-ended language instructions, particularly in dense and physically constrained environments. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve their reasoning performance.</description>

      <title>Scalable Image Tokenization with Index Backpropagation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vector quantization (VQ) methods struggle with scalability, largely attributed to the instability of the codebook that undergoes partial updates during training. The codebook is prone to collapse as utilization decreases, due to the progressively widening distribution gap between non-activated codes and visual features. To solve the problem, we propose Index Backpropagation Quantization (IBQ), a new VQ method for the joint optimization of all codebook embeddings and the visual encoder. Applying a straight-through estimator on the one-hot categorical distribution between the encoded feature and codebook, all codes are differentiable and maintain a consistent latent space with the visual encoder. IBQ enables scalable training of visual tokenizers and, for the first time, achieves a large-scale codebook ($2^{18}$) with high dimension ($256$) and high utilization. Experiments on the standard ImageNet benchmark demonstrate the scalability and superiority of IBQ, achieving competitive results on reconstruction and the application of autoregressive visual generation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Voken.</description>

      <title>SIDA: Social Media Image Deepfake Detection, Localization and Explanation with Large Multimodal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>WinTSR: A Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling Method for Interpreting Time Series Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</description>

      <title>DECO: Life-Cycle Management of Enterprise-Grade Copilots</title>

Abstract: Software engineers frequently grapple with the challenge of accessing disparate documentation and telemetry data, including TroubleShooting Guides (TSGs), incident reports, code repositories, and various internal tools developed by multiple stakeholders. While on-call duties are inevitable, incident resolution becomes even more daunting due to the obscurity of legacy sources and the pressures of strict time constraints. To enhance the efficiency of on-call engineers (OCEs) and streamline their daily workflows, we introduced DECO-a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade copilots tailored to improve productivity in engineering routines. This paper details the design and implementation of the DECO framework, emphasizing its innovative NL2SearchQuery functionality and a lightweight agentic framework. These features support efficient and customized retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) algorithms that not only extract relevant information from diverse sources but also select the most pertinent skills in response to user queries. This enables the addressing of complex technical questions and provides seamless, automated access to internal resources. Additionally, DECO incorporates a robust mechanism for converting unstructured incident logs into user-friendly, structured guides, effectively bridging the documentation gap.
  Since its launch in September 2023, DECO has demonstrated its effectiveness through widespread adoption, enabling tens of thousands of interactions and engaging hundreds of monthly active users (MAU) across dozens of organizations within the company.</description>

      <title>Sequential Compression Layers for Efficient Federated Learning in Foundational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across multiple nodes, each with its own private data. While LoRA has been widely adopted for parameter efficient federated fine-tuning, recent theoretical and empirical studies highlight its suboptimal performance in the federated learning context. In response, we propose a novel, simple, and more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that does not rely on LoRA. Our approach introduces a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer between two existing MLP layers the up proj (the FFN projection layer following the self-attention module) and down proj within the feed forward network of the transformer block. This solution addresses the bottlenecks associated with LoRA in federated fine tuning and outperforms recent LoRA-based approaches, demonstrating superior performance for both language models and vision encoders.</description>

      <title>Mobile-TeleVision: Predictive Motion Priors for Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots require both robust lower-body locomotion and precise upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion policy is trained conditioned on this upper-body motion representation, ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion. We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation. With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control, operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Boosting Alignment for Post-Unlearning Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale generative models have shown impressive image-generation capabilities, propelled by massive data. However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either poor unlearning quality or degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning, due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives. We further derive the characterization of such an update.
  In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/reds-lab/Restricted_gradient_diversity_unlearning.git.</description>

      <title>Physics Context Builders: A Modular Framework for Physical Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical reasoning, which involves interpreting object behaviors within dynamic environments, remains a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The limitations in physical reasoning arise from an inability to translate learned knowledge into predictions about physical behavior. We perform a careful study to show how continual fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. However, fine-tuning is expensive for large models and impractical to repeatedly perform for every task. This necessitates the creation of modular and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a novel modular framework where specialized VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts for larger VLMs to enhance their reasoning capabilities. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical understanding. We perform careful experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower, a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks. Notably, PCBs show strong Sim2Real transfer, successfully generalizing from simulated training data to real-world scenes. Our work demonstrates that enhancing visual perception through modular, simulation-trained components offers a practical approach to improving physical reasoning in VLMs, while providing insights into the factors affecting physical understanding in these models.</description>

      <title>DMin: Scalable Training Data Influence Estimation for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models (DMs), yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</description>

      <title>VCA: Video Curious Agent for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long video understanding poses unique challenges due to their temporal complexity and low information density. Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Synthesis on Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundus imaging is a critical tool in ophthalmology, with different imaging modalities offering unique advantages. For instance, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) can accurately identify eye diseases. However, traditional invasive FFA involves the injection of sodium fluorescein, which can cause discomfort and risks. Generating corresponding FFA images from non-invasive fundus images holds significant practical value but also presents challenges. First, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models. Second, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single diseases or single modalities, often resulting in poor performance for patients with various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel latent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a fine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and unleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we designed a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different modalities and disease types. On limited datasets, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods, offering significant potential to enhance ophthalmic diagnostics and patient care. Our code will be released soon to support further research in this field.</description>

      <title>SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.</description>

      <title>CoMT: A Novel Benchmark for Chain of Multi-modal Thought on Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated amazing success in multi-modal tasks, including advancements in Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning. Despite these successes, current benchmarks still follow a traditional paradigm with multi-modal input and text-modal output, which leads to significant drawbacks such as missing visual operations and vague expressions. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Chain of Multi-modal Thought (CoMT) benchmark to address these limitations. Different from the traditional MCoT benchmark, CoMT requires both multi-modal input and multi-modal reasoning output, aiming to mimic human-like reasoning that inherently integrates visual operation. Specifically, CoMT consists of four categories: (1) Visual Creation, (2) Visual Deletion, (3) Visual Update, and (4) Visual Selection to comprehensively explore complex visual operations and concise expression in real scenarios. We evaluate various LVLMs and strategies on CoMT, revealing some key insights into the capabilities and limitations of the current approaches. We hope that CoMT can inspire more research on introducing multi-modal generation into the reasoning process.</description>

      <title>SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. More details and code are available at https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enhanced Recommender Systems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) has transformative potential in various domains, including recommender systems (RS). There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. However, previous efforts mainly focus on LLM as RS, which may face the challenge of intolerant inference costs by LLM. Recently, the integration of LLM into RS, known as LLM-Enhanced Recommender Systems (LLMERS), has garnered significant interest due to its potential to address latency and memory constraints in real-world applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest research efforts aimed at leveraging LLM to enhance RS capabilities. We identify a critical shift in the field with the move towards incorporating LLM into the online system, notably by avoiding their use during inference. Our survey categorizes the existing LLMERS approaches into three primary types based on the component of the RS model being augmented: Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement, and Model Enhancement. We provide an in-depth analysis of each category, discussing the methodologies, challenges, and contributions of recent studies. Furthermore, we highlight several promising research directions that could further advance the field of LLMERS.</description>

      <title>Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>CAD-Assistant: Tool-Augmented VLLMs as Generic CAD Task Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CAD-Assistant, a general-purpose CAD agent for AI-assisted design. Our approach is based on a powerful Vision and Large Language Model (VLLM) as a planner and a tool-augmentation paradigm using CAD-specific tools. CAD-Assistant addresses multimodal user queries by generating actions that are iteratively executed on a Python interpreter equipped with the FreeCAD software, accessed via its Python API. Our framework is able to assess the impact of generated CAD commands on geometry and adapts subsequent actions based on the evolving state of the CAD design. We consider a wide range of CAD-specific tools including a sketch image parameterizer, rendering modules, a 2D cross-section generator, and other specialized routines. CAD-Assistant is evaluated on multiple CAD benchmarks, where it outperforms VLLM baselines and supervised task-specific methods. Beyond existing benchmarks, we qualitatively demonstrate the potential of tool-augmented VLLMs as general-purpose CAD solvers across diverse workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models provide significant convenience for software development, they can lead to ethical issues in job interviews and student assignments. Therefore, determining whether a piece of code is written by a human or generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model is a critical issue. In this study, we present AIGCodeSet, which consists of 2.828 AI-generated and 4.755 human-written Python codes, created using CodeLlama 34B, Codestral 22B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In addition, we share the results of our experiments conducted with baseline detection methods. Our experiments show that a Bayesian classifier outperforms the other models.</description>

      <title>Are GNNs Actually Effective for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Microservice Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted for fault diagnosis in microservice systems, premised on their ability to model service dependencies. However, the necessity of explicit graph structures remains underexamined, as existing evaluations conflate preprocessing with architectural contributions. To isolate the true value of GNNs, we propose DiagMLP, a deliberately minimal, topology-agnostic baseline that retains multimodal fusion capabilities while excluding graph modeling. Through ablation experiments across five datasets, DiagMLP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art GNN-based methods in fault detection, localization, and classification. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that graph structures are indispensable, revealing that: (i) preprocessing pipelines already encode critical dependency information, and (ii) GNN modules contribute marginally beyond multimodality fusion. Our work advocates for systematic re-evaluation of architectural complexity and highlights the need for standardized baseline protocols to validate model innovations.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Output Correlation Inferences for Multi-Output (aka Multi-Task) Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is arguably one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms in practice. One of its prominent applications is Bayesian optimization (BO). Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.</description>

      <title>Data-driven inventory management for new products: An adjusted Dyna-$Q$ approach with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for inventory management of newly launched products with no historical demand information. The algorithm follows the classic Dyna-$Q$ structure, balancing the model-free and model-based approaches, while accelerating the training process of Dyna-$Q$ and mitigating the model discrepancy generated by the model-based feedback. Based on the idea of transfer learning, warm-start information from the demand data of existing similar products can be incorporated into the algorithm to further stabilize the early-stage training and reduce the variance of the estimated optimal policy. Our approach is validated through a case study of bakery inventory management with real data. The adjusted Dyna-$Q$ shows up to a 23.7\% reduction in average daily cost compared with $Q$-learning, and up to a 77.5\% reduction in training time within the same horizon compared with classic Dyna-$Q$. By using transfer learning, it can be found that the adjusted Dyna-$Q$ has the lowest total cost, lowest variance in total cost, and relatively low shortage percentages among all the benchmarking algorithms under a 30-day testing.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Domain Shift in Federated Learning via Intra- and Inter-Domain Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning technique, allowing clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing private data. However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of heterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution, which is popular in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages the mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent solution for federated learning under domain shift. However, existing federated prototype learning methods focus soley on inter-domain prototypes and neglect intra-domain perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel federated prototype learning method, namely I$^2$PFL, which incorporates $\textbf{I}$ntra-domain and $\textbf{I}$nter-domain $\textbf{P}$rototypes, to mitigate domain shift from both perspectives and learn a generalized global model across multiple domains in federated learning. To construct intra-domain prototypes, we propose feature alignment with MixUp-based augmented prototypes to capture the diversity within local domains and enhance the generalization of local features. Additionally, we introduce a reweighting mechanism for inter-domain prototypes to generate generalized prototypes that reduce domain shift while providing inter-domain knowledge across multiple clients. Extensive experiments on the Digits, Office-10, and PACS datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>MonoSOWA: Scalable monocular 3D Object detector Without human Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a foundational task in computer vision with many important applications. Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured.
  We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets.
  The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model will be published soon.</description>

      <title>Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

      <title>Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</description>

      <title>KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</description>

      <title>Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model.
  Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images.
  Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings.
  Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional support dialogue systems aim to reduce help-seekers' distress and help them overcome challenges. While human values$\unicode{x2013}$core beliefs that shape an individual's priorities$\unicode{x2013}$are increasingly emphasized in contemporary psychological therapy for their role in fostering internal transformation and long-term emotional well-being, their integration into emotional support systems remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present a value-driven method for training emotional support dialogue systems designed to reinforce positive values in seekers. Notably, our model identifies which values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online support conversations from Reddit. We evaluate the method across support skills, seekers' emotional intensity, and value reinforcement. Our method consistently outperforms various baselines, effectively exploring and eliciting values from seekers. Additionally, leveraging crowd knowledge from Reddit significantly enhances its effectiveness. Therapists highlighted its ability to validate seekers' challenges and emphasize positive aspects of their situations$\unicode{x2013}$both crucial elements of value reinforcement. Our work, being the first to integrate value reinforcement into emotional support systems, demonstrates its promise and establishes a foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>Robust Multimodal Learning via Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models often experience a significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning. The code and pretrained models will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>CodeBrain: Imputing Any Brain MRI via Modality- and Instance-Specific Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unified MRI imputation, which can adapt to diverse imputation scenarios, is highly desirable as it reduces scanning costs and provides comprehensive MRI information for improved clinical diagnosis. Existing unified MRI imputation methods either rely on specific prompts to guide their transformation network or require multiple modality-specific modules. However, these approaches struggle to capture large modality and instance variations or become too complex to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose CodeBrain, a fundamentally different pipeline for unified brain MRI imputation. Our key idea is to reframe various inter-modality transformations as a full-modality code prediction task via a two-stage framework. In the first stage, CodeBrain reconstructs a target modality from any other modalities by learning a compact scalar-quantized code for each instance and modality. Any target modality can then be reconstructed with high fidelity by combining the corresponding code with shared features extracted from any available modality. In the second stage, a projection encoder is trained to predict full-modality compact codes from any incomplete MRI samples, effectively simulating various imputation scenarios. We evaluate our CodeBrain on two public brain MRI datasets (i.e., IXI and BraTS 2023). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeBrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark for unified brain MRI imputation. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>AdaSVD: Adaptive Singular Value Decomposition for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their substantial memory requirements present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}^\top$. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM/VLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements. Code and models of AdaSVD will be available at https://github.com/ZHITENGLI/AdaSVD.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Interactive LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</description>

      <title>IPO: Iterative Preference Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video foundation models have achieved significant advancement with the help of network upgrade as well as model scale-up. However, they are still hard to meet requirements of applications due to unsatisfied generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose to align video foundation models with human preferences from the perspective of post-training in this paper. Consequently, we introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated video quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a critic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct Preference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky Optimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance of signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. In addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large language model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels without need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently perform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the need of tediously manual labeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IPO can effectively improve the video generation quality of a pretrained model and help a model with only 2B parameters surpass the one with 5B parameters. Besides, IPO achieves new state-of-the-art performance on VBench benchmark.</description>

      <title>G2PDiffusion: Cross-Species Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction via Evolutionary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how genes influence phenotype across species is a fundamental challenge in genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in various fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. However, current phenotype prediction models are limited to individual species and expensive phenotype labeling process, making the genotype-to-phenotype prediction a highly domain-dependent and data-scarce problem. To this end, we suggest taking images as morphological proxies, facilitating cross-species generalization through large-scale multimodal pretraining. We propose the first genotype-to-phenotype diffusion model (G2PDiffusion) that generates morphological images from DNA considering two critical evolutionary signals, i.e., multiple sequence alignments (MSA) and environmental contexts. The model contains three novel components: 1) a MSA retrieval engine that identifies conserved and co-evolutionary patterns; 2) an environment-aware MSA conditional encoder that effectively models complex genotype-environment interactions; and 3) an adaptive phenomic alignment module to improve genotype-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments show that integrating evolutionary signals with environmental context enriches the model's understanding of phenotype variability across species, thereby offering a valuable and promising exploration into advanced AI-assisted genomic analysis.</description>

Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate, efficient, and unbiased solution. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Post-detection inference for sequential changepoint localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We study the problem of localizing the changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which a sequential detection algorithm $\mathcal A$ declares a change. We first construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint when pre- and post-change distributions are assumed to be known. We then extend our framework to composite pre- and post-change scenarios. We impose no conditions on the observation space or on $\mathcal A$ -- we only need to be able to run $\mathcal A$ on simulated data sequences. In summary, this work offers both theoretically sound and practically effective tools for sequential changepoint localization.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model of Electronic Medical Records for Adaptive Risk Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The U.S. allocates nearly 18\% of its GDP to healthcare but experiences lower life expectancy and higher preventable death rates compared to other high-income nations. Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospital stays. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. The Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES on the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset in emergency department settings, benchmarking its performance against traditional early warning systems and machine learning models. From 299,721 unique patients, 285,622 PHTs (60\% with hospital admissions) were processed, comprising over 357 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Its adaptability and accuracy offer a transformative tool for clinical decision-making, potentially improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Generative Distribution Prediction: A Unified Approach to Multimodal Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Training Sparse Mixture Of Experts Text Embedding Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based text embedding models have improved their performance on benchmarks like MIRACL and BEIR by increasing their parameter counts. However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline at \href{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}.</description>

      <title>Balancing optimism and pessimism in offline-to-online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider what we call the offline-to-online learning setting, focusing on stochastic finite-armed bandit problems. In offline-to-online learning, a learner starts with offline data collected from interactions with an unknown environment in a way that is not under the learner's control. Given this data, the learner begins interacting with the environment, gradually improving its initial strategy as it collects more data to maximize its total reward. The learner in this setting faces a fundamental dilemma: if the policy is deployed for only a short period, a suitable strategy (in a number of senses) is the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) algorithm, which is based on pessimism. LCB can effectively compete with any policy that is sufficiently "covered" by the offline data. However, for longer time horizons, a preferred strategy is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which is based on optimism. Over time, UCB converges to the performance of the optimal policy at a rate that is nearly the best possible among all online algorithms. In offline-to-online learning, however, UCB initially explores excessively, leading to worse short-term performance compared to LCB. This suggests that a learner not in control of how long its policy will be in use should start with LCB for short horizons and gradually transition to a UCB-like strategy as more rounds are played. This article explores how and why this transition should occur. Our main result shows that our new algorithm performs nearly as well as the better of LCB and UCB at any point in time. The core idea behind our algorithm is broadly applicable, and we anticipate that our results will extend beyond the multi-armed bandit setting.</description>

Abstract: Malware classification in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge due to concept drift, where the statistical properties of malware data evolve over time, complicating detection efforts. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework enhanced with a genetic algorithm to improve malware classification accuracy and adaptability. Our approach incorporates mutation operations and fitness score evaluations within genetic algorithms to continuously refine the deep learning model, ensuring robustness against evolving malware threats. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid method significantly enhances classification performance and adaptability, outperforming traditional static models. Our proposed approach offers a promising solution for real-time malware classification in ever-changing cybersecurity landscapes.</description>

      <title>Presumed Cultural Identity: How Names Shape LLM Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Names are deeply tied to human identity. They can serve as markers of individuality, cultural heritage, and personal history. However, using names as a core indicator of identity can lead to over-simplification of complex identities. When interacting with LLMs, user names are an important point of information for personalisation. Names can enter chatbot conversations through direct user input (requested by chatbots), as part of task contexts such as CV reviews, or as built-in memory features that store user information for personalisation. We study biases associated with names by measuring cultural presumptions in the responses generated by LLMs when presented with common suggestion-seeking queries, which might involve making assumptions about the user. Our analyses demonstrate strong assumptions about cultural identity associated with names present in LLM generations across multiple cultures. Our work has implications for designing more nuanced personalisation systems that avoid reinforcing stereotypes while maintaining meaningful customisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing events and their coreferential mentions in a document is essential for understanding semantic meanings of text. The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline. We will publish the dataset as well as the code.</description>

      <title>MomentSeeker: A Comprehensive Benchmark and A Strong Baseline For Moment Retrieval Within Long Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) holds great promise in addressing challenges associated with long video understanding. These methods retrieve useful moments from long videos for their presented tasks, thereby enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality answers in a cost-effective way. In this work, we present MomentSeeker, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate retrieval models' performance in handling general long-video moment retrieval (LVMR) tasks. MomentSeeker offers three key advantages. First, it incorporates long videos of over 500 seconds on average, making it the first benchmark specialized for long-video moment retrieval. Second, it covers a wide range of task categories (including Moment Search, Caption Alignment, Image-conditioned Moment Search, and Video-conditioned Moment Search) and diverse application scenarios (e.g., sports, movies, cartoons, and ego), making it a comprehensive tool for assessing retrieval models' general LVMR performance. Additionally, the evaluation tasks are carefully curated through human annotation, ensuring the reliability of assessment. We further fine-tune an MLLM-based LVMR retriever on synthetic data, which demonstrates strong performance on our benchmark. We perform extensive experiments with various popular multimodal retrievers based on our benchmark, whose results highlight the challenges of LVMR and limitations for existing methods. Our created resources will be shared with community to advance future research in this field.</description>

      <title>The Majority Vote Paradigm Shift: When Popular Meets Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably labelling data typically requires annotations from multiple human workers. However, humans are far from being perfect. Hence, it is a common practice to aggregate labels gathered from multiple annotators to make a more confident estimate of the true label. Among many aggregation methods, the simple and well known Majority Vote (MV) selects the class label polling the highest number of votes. However, despite its importance, the optimality of MV's label aggregation has not been extensively studied. We address this gap in our work by characterising the conditions under which MV achieves the theoretically optimal lower bound on label estimation error. Our results capture the tolerable limits on annotation noise under which MV can optimally recover labels for a given class distribution. This certificate of optimality provides a more principled approach to model selection for label aggregation as an alternative to otherwise inefficient practices that sometimes include higher experts, gold labels, etc., that are all marred by the same human uncertainty despite huge time and monetary costs. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Sim-to-Real Methods in RL: Progress, Prospects and Challenges with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13187</link>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been explored and verified to be effective in solving decision-making tasks in various domains, such as robotics, transportation, recommender systems, etc. It learns from the interaction with environments and updates the policy using the collected experience. However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</description>

      <title>Solving the encoding bottleneck: of the HHL algorithm, by the HHL algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers exponential speedup for solving the quantum linear-system problem. But some caveats for the speedup could be hard to met. One of the difficulties is the encoding bottleneck, i.e., the efficient preparation of the initial quantum state. To prepare an arbitrary $N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally require a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm. Here we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of $O(poly(\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm itself. Thus, applying this approach to prepare the initial state of the original HHL algorithm can preserve the exponential speedup advantage. It can also serve as a standalone solution for other applications demanding fast state preparation.</description>

      <title>FUIA: Model Inversion Attack against Federated Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the introduction of regulations related to the ``right to be forgotten", federated learning (FL) is facing new privacy compliance challenges. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of unlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities inherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from gradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion attack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU (sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In FUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and exploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the features and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of forgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal of FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its vulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws. Extensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the private information of forgotten data. To mitigate this privacy leakage, we also explore two potential defense methods, although these come at the cost of reduced unlearning effectiveness and the usability of the unlearned model.</description>

      <title>InterFeedback: Unveiling Interactive Intelligence of Large Multimodal Models via Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users, which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.</description>

      <title>KAD: No More FAD! An Effective and Efficient Evaluation Metric for Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.</description>

      <title>One-step Diffusion Models with $f$-Divergence Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

      <title>BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</description>

      <title>RAG-Enhanced Collaborative LLM Agents for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling a wide range of problems, including those in scientific computing, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, different models exhibit distinct strengths and preferences, resulting in varying levels of performance. In this paper, we compare the capabilities of the most advanced LLMs--DeepSeek, ChatGPT, and Claude--along with their reasoning-optimized versions in addressing computational challenges. Specifically, we evaluate their proficiency in solving traditional numerical problems in scientific computing as well as leveraging scientific machine learning techniques for PDE-based problems. We designed all our experiments so that a non-trivial decision is required, e.g. defining the proper space of input functions for neural operator learning. Our findings show that reasoning and hybrid-reasoning models consistently and significantly outperform non-reasoning ones in solving challenging problems, with ChatGPT o3-mini-high generally offering the fastest reasoning speed.</description>

      <title>MM-PoisonRAG: Disrupting Multimodal RAG with Local and Global Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) equipped with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) leverage both their rich parametric knowledge and the dynamic, external knowledge to excel in tasks such as Question Answering. While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</description>

      <title>VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with LoRA and Atrous Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</description>

      <title>M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>NeuroTree: Hierarchical Functional Brain Pathway Decoding for Mental Health Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing functional brain networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding psychiatric disorders and addictive behaviors. While existing fMRI-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) show considerable promise for feature extraction, they often fall short in characterizing complex relationships between brain regions and demographic factors and accounting for interpretable variables linked to psychiatric conditions. We propose NeuroTree to overcome these limitations, integrating a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework leverages an attention mechanism to optimize functional connectivity (FC), thereby enhancing dynamic FC feature learning for brain disease classification. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets and provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns. These findings underscore the model's efficacy in predicting psychiatric disorders and elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Clip-TTS: Contrastive Text-content and Mel-spectrogram, A High-Quality Text-to-Speech Method based on Contextual Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion datasets.Audio samples are available at: https://ltydd1314.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Low-Confidence Gold: Refining Low-Confidence Samples for Efficient Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning for Large Language Models is fundamentally constrained by the quality and efficiency of training datasets. This work introduces Low-Confidence Gold (LCG), a novel filtering framework that employs centroid-based clustering and confidence-guided selection for identifying valuable instruction pairs. Through a semi-supervised approach using a lightweight classifier trained on representative samples, LCG curates high-quality subsets while preserving data diversity. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on LCG-filtered subsets of 6K samples achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, with substantial improvements on MT-bench and consistent gains across comprehensive evaluation metrics. The framework's efficacy while maintaining model performance establishes a promising direction for efficient instruction tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in automating software development tasks, yet their capabilities with respect to software design tasks remains largely unclear. This study investigates the capabilities of an LLM in understanding, reproducing, and generating structures within the complex VIPER architecture, a design pattern for iOS applications. We leverage Bloom's taxonomy to develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the LLM's performance across different cognitive domains such as remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Experimental results, using ChatGPT 4 Turbo 2024-04-09, reveal that the LLM excelled in higher-order tasks like evaluating and creating, but faced challenges with lower-order tasks requiring precise retrieval of architectural details. These findings highlight both the potential of LLMs to reduce development costs and the barriers to their effective application in real-world software design scenarios. This study proposes a benchmark format for assessing LLM capabilities in software architecture, aiming to contribute toward more robust and accessible AI-driven development tools.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Unveil the Mysteries? An Exploration of Their Ability to Unlock Information in Complex Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining multiple perceptual inputs and performing combinatorial reasoning in complex scenarios is a sophisticated cognitive function in humans. With advancements in multi-modal large language models, recent benchmarks tend to evaluate visual understanding across multiple images. However, they often overlook the necessity of combinatorial reasoning across multiple perceptual information. To explore the ability of advanced models to integrate multiple perceptual inputs for combinatorial reasoning in complex scenarios, we introduce two benchmarks: Clue-Visual Question Answering (CVQA), with three task types to assess visual comprehension and synthesis, and Clue of Password-Visual Question Answering (CPVQA), with two task types focused on accurate interpretation and application of visual data. For our benchmarks, we present three plug-and-play approaches: utilizing model input for reasoning, enhancing reasoning through minimum margin decoding with randomness generation, and retrieving semantically relevant visual information for effective data integration. The combined results reveal current models' poor performance on combinatorial reasoning benchmarks, even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source model achieves only 33.04% accuracy on CVQA, and drops to 7.38% on CPVQA. Notably, our approach improves the performance of models on combinatorial reasoning, with a 22.17% boost on CVQA and 9.40% on CPVQA over the SOTA closed-source model, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing combinatorial reasoning with multiple perceptual inputs in complex scenarios. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval over Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (TG-KBs) have become increasingly crucial for answering queries by providing textual and structural knowledge. However, current retrieval methods often retrieve these two types of knowledge in isolation without considering their mutual reinforcement and some hybrid methods even bypass structural retrieval entirely after neighboring aggregation. To fill in this gap, we propose a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) to retrieve these two types of knowledge via a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework. In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MoR in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval with insights, including uneven retrieving performance across different query logics and the benefits of integrating structural trajectories for candidate reranking. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yoega/MoR.</description>

      <title>BixBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM-based Agents in Computational Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Superscopes: Amplifying Internal Feature Representations for Language Model Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and interpreting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) remains an open challenge. Patchscopes introduced a method for probing internal activations by patching them into new prompts, prompting models to self-explain their hidden representations. We introduce Superscopes, a technique that systematically amplifies superposed features in MLP outputs (multilayer perceptron) and hidden states before patching them into new contexts. Inspired by the "features as directions" perspective and the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) approach from diffusion models, Superscopes amplifies weak but meaningful features, enabling the interpretation of internal representations that previous methods failed to explain-all without requiring additional training. This approach provides new insights into how LLMs build context and represent complex concepts, further advancing mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>The Devil Is in the Details: Tackling Unimodal Spurious Correlations for Generalizable Multimodal Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Reward Models (MM-RMs) are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, particularly as LLMs increasingly interact with multimodal data. However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.</description>

      <title>MA-LoT: Multi-Agent Lean-based Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning enhances Formal Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving mathematical problems using computer-verifiable languages like Lean has significantly impacted mathematical and computer science communities. State-of-the-art methods utilize single Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents or provers to either generate complete proof or perform tree searches. However, single-agent methods inherently lack a structured way to combine high-level reasoning in Natural Language (NL) with Formal Language (FL) verification feedback. To solve these issues, we propose MA-LoT: Multi-Agent Lean-based Long Chain-of-Thought framework, (to the best of our knowledge), the first multi-agent framework for Lean4 theorem proving that balance high-level NL reasoning and FL verification in Long CoT. Using this structured interaction, our approach enables deeper insights and long-term coherence in proof generation, with which past methods struggle. We do this by leveraging emergent formal reasoning ability in Long CoT using our novel LoT-Transfer Learning training-inference pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves a 61.07% accuracy rate on the Lean4 version of the MiniF2F-Test dataset, largely outperforming GPT-4 (22.95%), single-agent tree search (InternLM-Step-Prover, 50.70%), and whole-proof generation (Godel-Prover, 55.33%) baselines. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of combining Long CoT with formal verification for a more insightful generation in a broader perspective.</description>

      <title>Less is more? Rewards in RL for Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically trained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least 32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense "scaffolded" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly effective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known to bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal solutions. This is especially a problem in complex cyber environments where policy weaknesses may not be noticed until exploited by an adversary. In this work we set out to evaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable training more effective cyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break down several evaluation limitations in existing work by proposing a ground truth evaluation score that goes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train and evaluate agents. By adapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate our methodology and ground truth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse reward mechanisms and compare them with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation considers a range of network sizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and proactive defensive actions. Our results show that sparse rewards, particularly positive reinforcement for an uncompromised network state, enable the training of more effective cyber defence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse rewards provide more stable training than dense rewards, and that both effectiveness and training stability are robust to a variety of cyber environment considerations.</description>

      <title>English K_Quantization of LLMs Does Not Disproportionately Diminish Multilingual Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k\_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.</description>

      <title>Small but Mighty: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Lightweight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in time series forecasting, their practical deployment remains constrained by excessive computational demands and memory footprints. Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.

      <title>Rethinking Video Tokenization: A Conditioned Diffusion-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing video tokenizers typically use the traditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture for video compression and reconstruction. However, to achieve good performance, its training process often relies on complex multi-stage training tricks that go beyond basic reconstruction loss and KL regularization. Among these tricks, the most challenging is the precise tuning of adversarial training with additional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the final stage, which can hinder stable convergence. In contrast to GANs, diffusion models offer more stable training processes and can generate higher-quality results. Inspired by these advantages, we propose CDT, a novel Conditioned Diffusion-based video Tokenizer, that replaces the GAN-based decoder with a conditional causal diffusion model. The encoder compresses spatio-temporal information into compact latents, while the decoder reconstructs videos through a reverse diffusion process conditioned on these latents. During inference, we incorporate a feature cache mechanism to generate videos of arbitrary length while maintaining temporal continuity and adopt sampling acceleration technique to enhance efficiency. Trained using only a basic MSE diffusion loss for reconstruction, along with KL term and LPIPS perceptual loss from scratch, extensive experiments demonstrate that CDT achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks with just a single-step sampling. Even a scaled-down version of CDT (3$\times$ inference speedup) still performs comparably with top baselines. Moreover, the latent video generation model trained with CDT also exhibits superior performance. The source code and pretrained weights will be released shortly, so please stay tuned for updates!</description>

Abstract: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of cardiovascular health and mortality, but tracking it longitudinally generally requires a wearable device, limiting its availability. We present PHRM, a deep learning system for passive heart rate (HR) and RHR measurements during everyday smartphone use, using facial video-based photoplethysmography. Our system was developed using 225,773 videos from 495 participants and validated on 185,970 videos from 205 participants in laboratory and free-living conditions, representing the largest validation study of its kind. Compared to reference electrocardiogram, PHRM achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) &lt; 10% for HR measurements across three skin tone groups of light, medium and dark pigmentation; MAPE for each skin tone group was non-inferior versus the others. Daily RHR measured by PHRM had a mean absolute error &lt; 5 bpm compared to a wearable HR tracker, and was associated with known risk factors. These results highlight the potential of smartphones to enable passive and equitable heart health monitoring.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of digitalization, various document images are being applied more extensively in production and daily life, and there is an increasingly urgent need for fast and accurate parsing of the content in document images. Therefore, this report presents PP-DocBee, a novel multimodal large language model designed for end-to-end document image understanding. First, we develop a data synthesis strategy tailored to document scenarios in which we build a diverse dataset to improve the model generalization. Then, we apply a few training techniques, including dynamic proportional sampling, data preprocessing, and OCR postprocessing strategies. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of PP-DocBee, achieving state-of-the-art results on English document understanding benchmarks and even outperforming existing open source and commercial models in Chinese document understanding. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleMIX}{https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleMIX}.</description>

      <title>ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</description>

      <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Language Models and Diffusion Models for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/.</description>

      <title>IDInit: A Universal and Stable Initialization Method for Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable accomplishments in practice. The success of these networks hinges on effective initialization methods, which are vital for ensuring stable and rapid convergence during training. Recently, initialization methods that maintain identity transition within layers have shown good efficiency in network training. These techniques (e.g., Fixup) set specific weights to zero to achieve identity control. However, settings of remaining weight (e.g., Fixup uses random values to initialize non-zero weights) will affect the inductive bias that is achieved only by a zero weight, which may be harmful to training. Addressing this concern, we introduce fully identical initialization (IDInit), a novel method that preserves identity in both the main and sub-stem layers of residual networks. IDInit employs a padded identity-like matrix to overcome rank constraints in non-square weight matrices. Furthermore, we show the convergence problem of an identity matrix can be solved by stochastic gradient descent. Additionally, we enhance the universality of IDInit by processing higher-order weights and addressing dead neuron problems. IDInit is a straightforward yet effective initialization method, with improved convergence, stability, and performance across various settings, including large-scale datasets and deep models.</description>

      <title>Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</description>

      <title>Chat-GPT: An AI Based Educational Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AI revolution is gathering momentum at an unprecedented rate. Over the past decade, we have witnessed a seemingly inevitable integration of AI in every facet of our lives. Much has been written about the potential revolutionary impact of AI in education. AI has the potential to completely revolutionise the educational landscape as we could see entire courses and degrees developed by programs such as ChatGPT. AI has the potential to develop courses, set assignments, grade and provide feedback to students much faster than a team of teachers. In addition, because of its dynamic nature, it has the potential to continuously improve its content. In certain fields such as computer science, where technology is continuously evolving, AI based applications can provide dynamically changing, relevant material to students. AI has the potential to replace entire degrees and may challenge the concept of higher education institutions. We could also see entire new disciplines emerge as a consequence of AI. This paper examines the practical impact of ChatGPT and why it is believed that its implementation is a critical step towards a new era of education. We investigate the impact that ChatGPT will have on learning, problem solving skills and cognitive ability of students. We examine the positives, negatives and many other aspects of AI and its applications throughout this paper.</description>

      <title>PanguIR Technical Report for NTCIR-18 AEOLLM Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain widespread attention in both academia and industry, it becomes increasingly critical and challenging to effectively evaluate their capabilities. Existing evaluation methods can be broadly categorized into two types: manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. Manual evaluation, while comprehensive, is often costly and resource-intensive. Conversely, automatic evaluation offers greater scalability but is constrained by the limitations of its evaluation criteria (dominated by reference-based answers). To address these challenges, NTCIR-18 introduced the AEOLLM (Automatic Evaluation of LLMs) task, aiming to encourage reference-free evaluation methods that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this paper, to enhance the evaluation performance of the AEOLLM task, we propose three key methods to improve the reference-free evaluation: 1) Multi-model Collaboration: Leveraging multiple LLMs to approximate human ratings across various subtasks; 2) Prompt Auto-optimization: Utilizing LLMs to iteratively refine the initial task prompts based on evaluation feedback from training samples; and 3) In-context Learning (ICL) Optimization: Based on the multi-task evaluation feedback, we train a specialized in-context example retrieval model, combined with a semantic relevance retrieval model, to jointly identify the most effective in-context learning examples. Experiments conducted on the final dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on the AEOLLM task.</description>

      <title>Cite Before You Speak: Enhancing Context-Response Grounding in E-commerce Conversational LLM-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of conversational large language models (LLMs), several LLM-based Conversational Shopping Agents (CSA) have been developed to help customers answer questions and smooth their shopping journey in e-commerce domain. The primary objective in building a trustworthy CSA is to ensure the agent's responses are accurate and factually grounded, which is essential for building customer trust and encouraging continuous engagement. However, two challenges remain. First, LLMs produce hallucinated or unsupported claims. Such inaccuracies risk spreading misinformation and diminishing customer trust. Second, without providing knowledge source attribution in CSA response, customers struggle to verify LLM-generated information. To address these challenges, we present an easily productionized solution that enables a "citation experience" utilizing In-context Learning (ICL) and Multi-UX-Inference (MUI) to generate responses with citations to attribute its original sources without interfering other existing UX features. With proper UX design, these citation marks can be linked to the related product information and display the source to our customers. In this work, we also build auto-metrics and scalable benchmarks to holistically evaluate LLM's grounding and attribution capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating this citation generation paradigm can substantially enhance the grounding of LLM responses by 13.83% on the real-world data. As such, our solution not only addresses the immediate challenges of LLM grounding issues but also adds transparency to conversational AI.</description>

      <title>RD Efficient FPGA Deployment of Learned Image Compression: Knowledge Distillation and Hybrid Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learnable Image Compression (LIC) has shown the potential to outperform standardized video codecs in RD efficiency, prompting the research for hardware-friendly implementations. Most existing LIC hardware implementations prioritize latency to RD-efficiency and through an extensive exploration of the hardware design space. We present a novel design paradigm where the burden of tuning the design for a specific hardware platform is shifted towards model dimensioning and without compromising on RD-efficiency. First, we design a framework for distilling a leaner student LIC model from a reference teacher: by tuning a single model hyperparameters, we can meet the constraints of different hardware platforms without a complex hardware design exploration. Second, we propose a hardware-friendly implementation of the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) activation that preserves RD efficiency even post parameter quantization. Third, we design a pipelined FPGA configuration which takes full advantage of available FPGA resources by leveraging parallel processing and optimizing resource allocation. Our experiments with a state of the art LIC model show that we outperform all existing FPGA implementations while performing very close to the original model in terms of RD efficiency.</description>

      <title>Every FLOP Counts: Scaling a 300B Mixture-of-Experts LING LLM without Premium GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.
