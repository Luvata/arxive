      <title>Mogo: RQ Hierarchical Causal Transformer for High-Quality 3D Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of text-to-motion generation, Bert-type Masked Models (MoMask, MMM) currently produce higher-quality outputs compared to GPT-type autoregressive models (T2M-GPT). However, these Bert-type models often lack the streaming output capability required for applications in video game and multimedia environments, a feature inherent to GPT-type models. Additionally, they demonstrate weaker performance in out-of-distribution generation. To surpass the quality of BERT-type models while leveraging a GPT-type structure, without adding extra refinement models that complicate scaling data, we propose a novel architecture, Mogo (Motion Only Generate Once), which generates high-quality lifelike 3D human motions by training a single transformer model. Mogo consists of only two main components: 1) RVQ-VAE, a hierarchical residual vector quantization variational autoencoder, which discretizes continuous motion sequences with high precision; 2) Hierarchical Causal Transformer, responsible for generating the base motion sequences in an autoregressive manner while simultaneously inferring residuals across different layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mogo can generate continuous and cyclic motion sequences up to 260 frames (13 seconds), surpassing the 196 frames (10 seconds) length limitation of existing datasets like HumanML3D. On the HumanML3D test set, Mogo achieves a FID score of 0.079, outperforming both the GPT-type model T2M-GPT (FID = 0.116), AttT2M (FID = 0.112) and the BERT-type model MMM (FID = 0.080). Furthermore, our model achieves the best quantitative performance in out-of-distribution generation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Correction: Explainable Feedback Generation for Visual Commonsense Reasoning Distractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable performance in the visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) task, which aims to answer a multiple-choice question based on visual commonsense within an image. However, the ability of LMMs to correct potential visual commonsense errors in the distractor upon their occurrence is yet under-explored. Drawing inspiration from how a human teacher crafts challenging distractors to test students' comprehension of the concepts or skills and assists them in identifying and correcting errors toward the answer, we are the pioneering research for LMMs to simulate this error correction process. To this end, we employ GPT-4 as a ``teacher'' to collect the explainable feedback dataset VCR-DF for error correction, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LMMs to identify misconceptions and clarify reasons behind the error in VCR distractors toward final answers. In addition, we propose an LMM-based Pedagogical Expert Instructed Feedback Generation (PEIFG) model to incorporate the learnable expert prompts and multimodal instruction as guidance for feedback generation. Experimental results show that our PEIFG significantly outperforms existing LMMs. We believe that our benchmark provides a new direction for evaluating the capabilities of LMMs.</description>

      <title>Language Model as Visual Explainer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Language Model as Visual Explainer LVX, a systematic approach for interpreting the internal workings of vision models using a tree-structured linguistic explanation, without the need for model training. Central to our strategy is the collaboration between vision models and LLM to craft explanations. On one hand, the LLM is harnessed to delineate hierarchical visual attributes, while concurrently, a text-to-image API retrieves images that are most aligned with these textual concepts. By mapping the collected texts and images to the vision model's embedding space, we construct a hierarchy-structured visual embedding tree. This tree is dynamically pruned and grown by querying the LLM using language templates, tailoring the explanation to the model. Such a scheme allows us to seamlessly incorporate new attributes while eliminating undesired concepts based on the model's representations. When applied to testing samples, our method provides human-understandable explanations in the form of attribute-laden trees. Beyond explanation, we retrained the vision model by calibrating it on the generated concept hierarchy, allowing the model to incorporate the refined knowledge of visual attributes. To access the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce new benchmarks and conduct rigorous evaluations, demonstrating its plausibility, faithfulness, and stability.</description>

      <title>3DSRBench: A Comprehensive 3D Spatial Reasoning Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

      <title>Low-Latency Scalable Streaming for Event-Based Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the rise of novel ``event-based'' camera sensors for high-speed, low-power video capture. Rather than recording discrete image frames, these sensors output asynchronous ``event'' tuples with microsecond precision, only when the brightness change of a given pixel exceeds a certain threshold. Although these sensors have enabled compelling new computer vision applications, these applications often require expensive, power-hungry GPU systems, rendering them incompatible for deployment on the low-power devices for which event cameras are optimized. Whereas receiver-driven rate adaptation is a crucial feature of modern video streaming solutions, this topic is underexplored in the realm of event-based vision systems. On a real-world event camera dataset, we first demonstrate that a state-of-the-art object detection application is resilient to dramatic data loss, and that this loss may be weighted towards the end of each temporal window. We then propose a scalable streaming method for event-based data based on Media Over QUIC, prioritizing object detection performance and low latency. The application server can receive complementary event data across several streams simultaneously, and drop streams as needed to maintain a certain latency. With a latency target of 5 ms for end-to-end transmission across a small network, we observe an average reduction in detection mAP as low as 0.36. With a more relaxed latency target of 50 ms, we observe an average mAP reduction as low as 0.19.</description>

      <title>Pix2Poly: A Sequence Prediction Method for End-to-end Polygonal Building Footprint Extraction from Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraction of building footprint polygons from remotely sensed data is essential for several urban understanding tasks such as reconstruction, navigation, and mapping. Despite significant progress in the area, extracting accurate polygonal building footprints remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce Pix2Poly, an attention-based end-to-end trainable and differentiable deep neural network capable of directly generating explicit high-quality building footprints in a ring graph format. Pix2Poly employs a generative encoder-decoder transformer to produce a sequence of graph vertex tokens whose connectivity information is learned by an optimal matching network. Compared to previous graph learning methods, ours is a truly end-to-end trainable approach that extracts high-quality building footprints and road networks without requiring complicated, computationally intensive raster loss functions and intricate training pipelines. Upon evaluating Pix2Poly on several complex and challenging datasets, we report that Pix2Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several vector shape quality metrics while being an entirely explicit method. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeshwanth95/Pix2Poly.</description>

      <title>Robust Multiple Description Neural Video Codec with Masked Transformer for Dynamic and Noisy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Description Coding (MDC) is a promising error-resilient source coding method that is particularly suitable for dynamic networks with multiple (yet noisy and unreliable) paths. However, conventional MDC video codecs suffer from cumbersome architectures, poor scalability, limited loss resilience, and lower compression efficiency. As a result, MDC has never been widely adopted. Inspired by the potential of neural video codecs, this paper rethinks MDC design. We propose a novel MDC video codec, NeuralMDC, demonstrating how bidirectional transformers trained for masked token prediction can vastly simplify the design of MDC video codec. To compress a video, NeuralMDC starts by tokenizing each frame into its latent representation and then splits the latent tokens to create multiple descriptions containing correlated information. Instead of using motion prediction and warping operations, NeuralMDC trains a bidirectional masked transformer to model the spatial-temporal dependencies of latent representations and predict the distribution of the current representation based on the past. The predicted distribution is used to independently entropy code each description and infer any potentially lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate NeuralMDC achieves state-of-the-art loss resilience with minimal sacrifices in compression efficiency, significantly outperforming the best existing residual-coding-based error-resilient neural video codec.</description>

      <title>PGRID: Power Grid Reconstruction in Informal Developments Using High-Resolution Aerial Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of 2023, a record 117 million people have been displaced worldwide, more than double the number from a decade ago [22]. Of these, 32 million are refugees under the UNHCR mandate, with 8.7 million residing in refugee camps. A critical issue faced by these populations is the lack of access to electricity, with 80% of the 8.7 million refugees and displaced persons in camps globally relying on traditional biomass for cooking and lacking reliable power for essential tasks such as cooking and charging phones. Often, the burden of collecting firewood falls on women and children, who frequently travel up to 20 kilometers into dangerous areas, increasing their vulnerability.[7]
  Electricity access could significantly alleviate these challenges, but a major obstacle is the lack of accurate power grid infrastructure maps, particularly in resource-constrained environments like refugee camps, needed for energy access planning. Existing power grid maps are often outdated, incomplete, or dependent on costly, complex technologies, limiting their practicality. To address this issue, PGRID is a novel application-based approach, which utilizes high-resolution aerial imagery to detect electrical poles and segment electrical lines, creating precise power grid maps. PGRID was tested in the Turkana region of Kenya, specifically the Kakuma and Kalobeyei Camps, covering 84 km2 and housing over 200,000 residents.
  Our findings show that PGRID delivers high-fidelity power grid maps especially in unplanned settlements, with F1-scores of 0.71 and 0.82 for pole detection and line segmentation, respectively. This study highlights a practical application for leveraging open data and limited labels to improve power grid mapping in unplanned settlements, where the growing number of displaced persons urgently need sustainable energy infrastructure solutions.</description>

      <title>Balancing Shared and Task-Specific Representations: A Hybrid Approach to Depth-Aware Video Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Multiformer, a novel approach to depth-aware video panoptic segmentation (DVPS) based on the mask transformer paradigm. Our method learns object representations that are shared across segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and object tracking subtasks. In contrast to recent unified approaches that progressively refine a common object representation, we propose a hybrid method using task-specific branches within each decoder block, ultimately fusing them into a shared representation at the block interfaces. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes-DVPS and SemKITTI-DVPS datasets demonstrate that Multiformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across all DVPS metrics, outperforming previous methods by substantial margins. With a ResNet-50 backbone, Multiformer surpasses the previous best result by 3.0 DVPQ points while also improving depth estimation accuracy. Using a Swin-B backbone, Multiformer further improves performance by 4.0 DVPQ points. Multiformer also provides valuable insights into the design of multi-task decoder architectures.</description>

      <title>TTVD: Towards a Geometric Framework for Test-Time Adaptation Based on Voronoi Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle with generalization when deploying on real-world data, due to the common distributional shift to the training data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to address this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when making predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained attention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to alleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to their inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful patterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we study the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the underlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram, a classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on this observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram guidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this geometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1) Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution of self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2) Power Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines partitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under rigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore the effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Attention Warping for Consistent 3D Scene Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for 3D scene editing using diffusion models, designed to ensure view consistency and realism across perspectives. Our approach leverages attention features extracted from a single reference image to define the intended edits. These features are warped across multiple views by aligning them with scene geometry derived from Gaussian splatting depth estimates. Injecting these warped features into other viewpoints enables coherent propagation of edits, achieving high fidelity and spatial alignment in 3D space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating versatile edits of 3D scenes, significantly advancing the capabilities of scene manipulation compared to the existing methods.

      <title>Enhancing Remote Adversarial Patch Attacks on Face Detectors with Tiling and Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the attack feasibility of Remote Adversarial Patch (RAP) targeting face detectors. The RAP that targets face detectors is similar to the RAP that targets general object detectors, but the former has multiple issues in the attack process the latter does not. (1) It is possible to detect objects of various scales. In particular, the area of small objects that are convolved during feature extraction by CNN is small,so the area that affects the inference results is also small. (2) It is a two-class classification, so there is a large gap in characteristics between the classes. This makes it difficult to attack the inference results by directing them to a different class. In this paper, we propose a new patch placement method and loss function for each problem. The patches targeting the proposed face detector showed superior detection obstruct effects compared to the patches targeting the general object detector.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation in Context through Collaborative LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</description>

Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references.

      <title>Static-Dynamic Class-level Perception Consistency in Video Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video semantic segmentation(VSS) has been widely employed in lots of fields, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, autonomous driving and surveillance. Its core challenge is how to leverage temporal information to achieve better segmentation. Previous efforts have primarily focused on pixel-level static-dynamic contexts matching, utilizing techniques such as optical flow and attention mechanisms. Instead, this paper rethinks static-dynamic contexts at the class level and proposes a novel static-dynamic class-level perceptual consistency (SD-CPC) framework. In this framework, we propose multivariate class prototype with contrastive learning and a static-dynamic semantic alignment module. The former provides class-level constraints for the model, obtaining personalized inter-class features and diversified intra-class features. The latter first establishes intra-frame spatial multi-scale and multi-level correlations to achieve static semantic alignment. Then, based on cross-frame static perceptual differences, it performs two-stage cross-frame selective aggregation to achieve dynamic semantic alignment. Meanwhile, we propose a window-based attention map calculation method that leverages the sparsity of attention points during cross-frame aggregation to reduce computation cost. Extensive experiments on VSPW and Cityscapes datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Surveying Facial Recognition Models for Diverse Indian Demographics: A Comparative Analysis on LFW and Custom Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial recognition technology has made significant advances, yet its effectiveness across diverse ethnic backgrounds, particularly in specific Indian demographics, is less explored. This paper presents a detailed evaluation of both traditional and deep learning-based facial recognition models using the established LFW dataset and our newly developed IITJ Faces of Academia Dataset (JFAD), which comprises images of students from IIT Jodhpur. This unique dataset is designed to reflect the ethnic diversity of India, providing a critical test bed for assessing model performance in a focused academic environment. We analyze models ranging from holistic approaches like Eigenfaces and SIFT to advanced hybrid models that integrate CNNs with Gabor filters, Laplacian transforms, and segmentation techniques. Our findings reveal significant insights into the models' ability to adapt to the ethnic variability within Indian demographics and suggest modifications to enhance accuracy and inclusivity in real-world applications. The JFAD not only serves as a valuable resource for further research but also highlights the need for developing facial recognition systems that perform equitably across diverse populations.</description>

      <title>DynamicPAE: Generating Scene-Aware Physical Adversarial Examples in Real-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as "whistle-blowers" of real-world risks in deep-learning applications. However, current PAE generation studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes. The key challenges in generating dynamic PAEs are exploring their patterns under noisy gradient feedback and adapting the attack to agnostic scenario natures. To address the problems, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks beyond static attacks. Specifically, to train the dynamic PAE generator under noisy gradient feedback, we introduce the residual-driven sample trajectory guidance technique, which redefines the training task to break the limited feedback information restriction that leads to the degeneracy problem. Intuitively, it allows the gradient feedback to be passed to the generator through a low-noise auxiliary task, thereby guiding the optimization away from degenerate solutions and facilitating a more comprehensive and stable exploration of feasible PAEs. To adapt the generator to agnostic scenario natures, we introduce the context-aligned scene expectation simulation process, consisting of the conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective re-weighting module. The former enhances robustness in the context of incomplete observation by employing a conditional probabilistic model for domain randomization, while the latter facilitates consistent stealth control across different attack targets by automatically reweighting losses based on the skewness indicator. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 1.95 $\times$ boost (65.55% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g., Yolo-v8) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of multispectral image fusion is to combine object or scene features of images with different spectral characteristics to increase the perceptual quality. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based solution to image fusion problem focusing on infrared and visible spectrum images. The proposed solution utilizes only convolution and pooling layers together with a loss function using no-reference quality metrics. The analysis is performed qualitatively and quantitatively on various datasets. The results show better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Also, the size of our network enables real-time performance on embedded devices. Project codes can be found at \url{https://github.com/ferhatcan/pyFusionSR}.</description>

      <title>EM-Net: Gaze Estimation with Expectation Maximization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the accuracy of gaze estimation techniques has gradually improved, but existing methods often rely on large datasets or large models to improve performance, which leads to high demands on computational resources. In terms of this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight gaze estimation model EM-Net based on deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms Expectation Maximization algorithm. First, the proposed Global Attention Mechanism(GAM) is added to extract features related to gaze estimation to improve the model's ability to capture global dependencies and thus improve its performance. Second, by learning hierarchical feature representations through the EM module, the model has strong generalization ability, which reduces the need for sample size. Experiments have confirmed that, on the premise of using only 50% of the training data, EM-Net improves the performance of Gaze360, MPIIFaceGaze, and RT-Gene datasets by 2.2%, 2.02%, and 2.03%, respectively, compared with GazeNAS-ETH. It also shows good robustness in the face of Gaussian noise interference.</description>

      <title>How to select slices for annotation to train best-performing deep learning segmentation models for cross-sectional medical images?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of medical images highly depends on the availability of accurate manual image annotations. Such annotations are very time-consuming and costly to generate, and often require specialized expertise, particularly for cross-sectional images which contain many slices for each patient. It is crucial to ensure the best use of annotation resources. In this paper, we systematically answer the question of how to select slices of cross-sectional medical images in order to maximize performance of the resulting deep learning segmentation models. We conducted experiments on 4 medical imaging segmentation tasks with varying annotation budgets, numbers of annotated cases, numbers of annotated slices per volume, slice selection techniques, and mask interpolations. We found that:
  1) It is almost always preferable to annotate fewer slices per volume and more volumes given an annotation budget. 2) Selecting slices for annotation by unsupervised active learning (UAL) is not superior to selecting slices randomly or at fixed intervals, provided that each volume is allocated the same number of annotated slices. 3) Interpolating masks between annotated slices rarely enhances model performance, with exceptions of some specific configuration for 3D models.</description>

      <title>FaceTracer: Unveiling Source Identities from Swapped Face Images and Videos for Fraud Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face-swapping techniques have advanced rapidly with the evolution of deep learning, leading to widespread use and growing concerns about potential misuse, especially in cases of fraud. While many efforts have focused on detecting swapped face images or videos, these methods are insufficient for tracing the malicious users behind fraudulent activities. Intrusive watermark-based approaches also fail to trace unmarked identities, limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we introduce FaceTracer, the first non-intrusive framework specifically designed to trace the identity of the source person from swapped face images or videos. Specifically, FaceTracer leverages a disentanglement module that effectively suppresses identity information related to the target person while isolating the identity features of the source person. This allows us to extract robust identity information that can directly link the swapped face back to the original individual, aiding in uncovering the actors behind fraudulent activities. Extensive experiments demonstrate FaceTracer's effectiveness across various face-swapping techniques, successfully identifying the source person in swapped content and enabling the tracing of malicious actors involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, FaceTracer shows strong transferability to unseen face-swapping methods including commercial applications and robustness against transmission distortions and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model-based estimation of 3D animal pose and shape from images enables computational modeling of animal behavior. Training models for this purpose requires large amounts of labeled image data with precise pose and shape annotations. However, capturing such data requires the use of multi-view or marker-based motion-capture systems, which are impractical to adapt to wild animals in situ and impossible to scale across a comprehensive set of animal species. Some have attempted to address the challenge of procuring training data by pseudo-labeling individual real-world images through manual 2D annotation, followed by 3D-parameter optimization to those labels. While this approach may produce silhouette-aligned samples, the obtained pose and shape parameters are often implausible due to the ill-posed nature of the monocular fitting problem. Sidestepping real-world ambiguity, others have designed complex synthetic-data-generation pipelines leveraging video-game engines and collections of artist-designed 3D assets. Such engines yield perfect ground-truth annotations but are often lacking in visual realism and require considerable manual effort to adapt to new species or environments. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose an alternative approach to synthetic-data generation: rendering with a conditional image-generation model. We introduce a pipeline that samples a diverse set of poses and shapes for a variety of mammalian quadrupeds and generates realistic images with corresponding ground-truth pose and shape parameters. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we introduce GenZoo, a synthetic dataset containing one million images of distinct subjects. We train a 3D pose and shape regressor on GenZoo, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a real-world animal pose and shape estimation benchmark, despite being trained solely on synthetic data. https://genzoo.is.tue.mpg.de</description>

      <title>Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbations: Deceiving Vision-Language Models Across Both Images and Text with a Single Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multimodal tasks by integrating vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among such attacks, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are especially powerful, as a single optimized perturbation can mislead the model across various input images. In this work, we introduce a novel UAP specifically designed for VLMs: the Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbation (Doubly-UAP), capable of universally deceiving VLMs across both image and text inputs. To successfully disrupt the vision encoder's fundamental process, we analyze the core components of the attention mechanism. After identifying value vectors in the middle-to-late layers as the most vulnerable, we optimize Doubly-UAP in a label-free manner with a frozen model. Despite being developed as a black-box to the LLM, Doubly-UAP achieves high attack success rates on VLMs, consistently outperforming baseline methods across vision-language tasks. Extensive ablation studies and analyses further demonstrate the robustness of Doubly-UAP and provide insights into how it influences internal attention mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieved strong performance on a variety of tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, visual question answering). However, most VLMs rely on coarse-grained image-caption pairs for alignment, relying on data volume to resolve ambiguities and ground linguistic concepts in images. The richer semantic and syntactic structure within text is largely overlooked. To address this, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST) that enhances VLM training without any additional supervision, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subject, Noun Phrases, and Composite Phrases. Entailment between these constituent components allows us to formulate additional regularization constraints on the VLM attention maps. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Addition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed; we illustrate its efficacy on BLIP and ALBEF. HIST outperforms baseline VLMs, achieving up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding, +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation, +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering, underscoring the value of structuring learning in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Seeing Syntax: Uncovering Syntactic Learning Limitations in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.</description>

      <title>DAKD: Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation using Diffusion Models for SAR Oil Spill Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oil spills in the ocean pose severe environmental risks, making early detection essential. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based oil spill segmentation offers robust monitoring under various conditions but faces challenges due to the limited labeled data and inherent speckle noise in SAR imagery. To address these issues, we propose (i) a diffusion-based Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) pipeline and (ii) a novel SAR oil spill segmentation network, called SAROSS-Net. In our DAKD pipeline, we present a diffusion-based SAR-JointNet that learns to generate realistic SAR images and their labels for segmentation, by effectively modeling joint distribution with balancing two modalities. The DAKD pipeline augments the training dataset and distills knowledge from SAR-JointNet by utilizing generated soft labels (pixel-wise probability maps) to supervise our SAROSS-Net. The SAROSS-Net is designed to selectively transfer high-frequency features from noisy SAR images, by employing novel Context-Aware Feature Transfer blocks along skip connections. We demonstrate our SAR-JointNet can generate realistic SAR images and well-aligned segmentation labels, providing the augmented data to train SAROSS-Net with enhanced generalizability. Our SAROSS-Net trained with the DAKD pipeline significantly outperforms existing SAR oil spill segmentation methods with large margins.</description>

      <title>Dense Depth from Event Focal Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for dense depth estimation from an event stream generated when sweeping the focal plane of the driving lens attached to an event camera. In this method, a depth map is inferred from an ``event focal stack'' composed of the event stream using a convolutional neural network trained with synthesized event focal stacks. The synthesized event stream is created from a focal stack generated by Blender for any arbitrary 3D scene. This allows for training on scenes with diverse structures. Additionally, we explored methods to eliminate the domain gap between real event streams and synthetic event streams. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a depth-from-defocus method in the image domain on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multi-granular Alignments for Grounded Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at matching concepts across multi-modal inputs but struggle with compositional concepts and high-level relationships between entities. This paper introduces Progressive multi-granular Vision-Language alignments (PromViL), a novel framework to enhance LVLMs' ability in performing grounded compositional visual reasoning tasks. Our approach constructs a hierarchical structure of multi-modal alignments, ranging from simple to complex concepts. By progressively aligning textual descriptions with corresponding visual regions, our model learns to leverage contextual information from lower levels to inform higher-level reasoning. To facilitate this learning process, we introduce a data generation process that creates a novel dataset derived from Visual Genome, providing a wide range of nested compositional vision-language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our PromViL framework significantly outperforms baselines on various visual grounding and compositional question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>DiffRaman: A Conditional Latent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Bacterial Raman Spectroscopy Identification Under Limited Data Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy has attracted significant attention in various biochemical detection fields, especially in the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria. The integration of this technology with deep learning to facilitate automated bacterial Raman spectroscopy diagnosis has emerged as a key focus in recent research. However, the diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods largely depends on a sufficient dataset, and in scenarios where there is a limited availability of Raman spectroscopy data, it is inadequate to fully optimize the numerous parameters of deep neural networks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data generation method utilizing deep generative models to expand the data volume and enhance the recognition accuracy of bacterial Raman spectra. Specifically, we introduce DiffRaman, a conditional latent denoising diffusion probability model for Raman spectra generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic bacterial Raman spectra generated by DiffRaman can effectively emulate real experimental spectra, thereby enhancing the performance of diagnostic models, especially under conditions of limited data. Furthermore, compared to existing generative models, the proposed DiffRaman offers improvements in both generation quality and computational efficiency. Our DiffRaman approach offers a well-suited solution for automated bacteria Raman spectroscopy diagnosis in data-scarce scenarios, offering new insights into alleviating the labor of spectroscopic measurements and enhancing rare bacteria identification.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distance Rivals Kullback-Leibler Divergence for Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since pioneering work of Hinton et al., knowledge distillation based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) has been predominant, and recently its variants have achieved compelling performance. However, KL-Div only compares probabilities of the corresponding category between the teacher and student while lacking a mechanism for cross-category comparison. Besides, KL-Div is problematic when applied to intermediate layers, as it cannot handle non-overlapping distributions and is unaware of geometry of the underlying manifold. To address these downsides, we propose a methodology of Wasserstein Distance (WD) based knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a logit distillation method called WKD-L based on discrete WD, which performs cross-category comparison of probabilities and thus can explicitly leverage rich interrelations among categories. Moreover, we introduce a feature distillation method called WKD-F, which uses a parametric method for modeling feature distributions and adopts continuous WD for transferring knowledge from intermediate layers. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification and object detection have shown (1) for logit distillation WKD-L outperforms very strong KL-Div variants; (2) for feature distillation WKD-F is superior to the KL-Div counterparts and state-of-the-art competitors.

      <title>A Review of Intelligent Device Fault Diagnosis Technologies Based on Machine Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of mechanical equipment fault diagnosis methods, focusing on the advancements brought by Transformer-based models. It details the structure, working principles, and benefits of Transformers, particularly their self-attention mechanism and parallel computation capabilities, which have propelled their widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision. The discussion highlights key Transformer model variants, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and their extensions, which leverage self-attention to improve accuracy and efficiency in visual tasks. Furthermore, the paper examines the application of Transformer-based approaches in intelligent fault diagnosis for mechanical systems, showcasing their superior ability to extract and recognize patterns from complex sensor data for precise fault identification. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, significant computational demands, and difficulties in deploying models on resource-limited devices. To address these limitations, the paper proposes future research directions, such as developing lightweight Transformer architectures, integrating multimodal data sources, and enhancing adaptability to diverse operational conditions. These efforts aim to further expand the application of Transformer-based methods in mechanical fault diagnosis, making them more robust, efficient, and suitable for real-world industrial environments.</description>

      <title>AsyncDSB: Schedule-Asynchronous Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge for Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image inpainting is an important image generation task, which aims to restore corrupted image from partial visible area. Recently, diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge methods effectively tackle this task by modeling the translation between corrupted and target images as a diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge process along a noising schedule path. Although these methods have shown superior performance, in this paper, we find that 1) existing methods suffer from a schedule-restoration mismatching issue, i.e., the theoretical schedule and practical restoration processes usually exist a large discrepancy, which theoretically results in the schedule not fully leveraged for restoring images; and 2) the key reason causing such issue is that the restoration process of all pixels are actually asynchronous but existing methods set a synchronous noise schedule to them, i.e., all pixels shares the same noise schedule. To this end, we propose a schedule-Asynchronous Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (AsyncDSB) for image inpainting. Our insight is preferentially scheduling pixels with high frequency (i.e., large gradients) and then low frequency (i.e., small gradients). Based on this insight, given a corrupted image, we first train a network to predict its gradient map in corrupted area. Then, we regard the predicted image gradient as prior and design a simple yet effective pixel-asynchronous noise schedule strategy to enhance the diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. Thanks to the asynchronous schedule at pixels, the temporal interdependence of restoration process between pixels can be fully characterized for high-quality image inpainting. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our AsyncDSB achieves superior performance, especially on FID with around 3% - 14% improvement over state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>How Vision-Language Tasks Benefit from Large Pre-trained Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of various vision-language tasks, such as visual captioning, visual question answering, and visual commonsense reasoning, is an important area in artificial intelligence and continuously attracts the research community's attention. Despite the improvements in overall performance, classic challenges still exist in vision-language tasks and hinder the development of this area. In recent years, the rise of pre-trained models is driving the research on vision-language tasks. Thanks to the massive scale of training data and model parameters, pre-trained models have exhibited excellent performance in numerous downstream tasks. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of pre-trained models, new paradigms have emerged to solve the classic challenges. Such methods have become mainstream in current research with increasing attention and rapid advances. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of how vision-language tasks benefit from pre-trained models. First, we review several main challenges in vision-language tasks and discuss the limitations of previous solutions before the era of pre-training. Next, we summarize the recent advances in incorporating pre-trained models to address the challenges in vision-language tasks. Finally, we analyze the potential risks associated with the inherent limitations of pre-trained models and discuss possible solutions, attempting to provide future research directions.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Hybrid Propagator for Temporal Misalignment in Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual video segmentation (AVVS) aims to generate pixel-level maps of sound-producing objects that accurately align with the corresponding audio. However, existing methods often face temporal misalignment, where audio cues and segmentation results are not temporally coordinated. Audio provides two critical pieces of information: i) target object-level details and ii) the timing of when objects start and stop producing sounds. Current methods focus more on object-level information but neglect the boundaries of audio semantic changes, leading to temporal misalignment. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Hybrid Propagator Framework~(Co-Prop). This framework includes two main steps: Preliminary Audio Boundary Anchoring and Frame-by-Frame Audio-Insert Propagation. To Anchor the audio boundary, we employ retrieval-assist prompts with Qwen large language models to identify control points of audio semantic changes. These control points split the audio into semantically consistent audio portions. After obtaining the control point lists, we propose the Audio Insertion Propagator to process each audio portion using a frame-by-frame audio insertion propagation and matching approach. We curated a compact dataset comprising diverse source conversion cases and devised a metric to assess alignment rates. Compared to traditional simultaneous processing methods, our approach reduces memory requirements and facilitates frame alignment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three datasets and two backbones. Furthermore, our method can be integrated with existing AVVS approaches, offering plug-and-play functionality to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Illusory VQA: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multimodal Models on Visual Illusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has made significant strides, particularly with the advent of multimodal models that integrate vision and language understanding. However, existing VQA datasets often overlook the complexities introduced by image illusions, which pose unique challenges for both human perception and model interpretation. In this study, we introduce a novel task called Illusory VQA, along with four specialized datasets: IllusionMNIST, IllusionFashionMNIST, IllusionAnimals, and IllusionChar. These datasets are designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal models in recognizing and interpreting visual illusions. We assess the zero-shot performance of various models, fine-tune selected models on our datasets, and propose a simple yet effective solution for illusion detection using Gaussian and blur low-pass filters. We show that this method increases the performance of models significantly and in the case of BLIP-2 on IllusionAnimals without any fine-tuning, it outperforms humans. Our findings highlight the disparity between human and model perception of illusions and demonstrate that fine-tuning and specific preprocessing techniques can significantly enhance model robustness. This work contributes to the development of more human-like visual understanding in multimodal models and suggests future directions for adapting filters using learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Improving Model Collapse in Rectified Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models aim to produce synthetic data indistinguishable from real distributions, but iterative training on self-generated data can lead to \emph{model collapse (MC)}, where performance degrades over time. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of MC in Rectified Flow by framing it within the context of Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs). We show that when DAE models are trained on recursively generated synthetic data with small noise variance, they suffer from MC with progressive diminishing generation quality. To address this MC issue, we propose methods that strategically incorporate real data into the training process, even when direct noise-image pairs are unavailable. Our proposed techniques, including Reverse Collapse-Avoiding (RCA) Reflow and Online Collapse-Avoiding Reflow (OCAR), effectively prevent MC while maintaining the efficiency benefits of Rectified Flow. Extensive experiments on standard image datasets demonstrate that our methods not only mitigate MC but also improve sampling efficiency, leading to higher-quality image generation with fewer sampling steps.</description>

      <title>TextRefiner: Internal Visual Feature as Efficient Refiner for Vision-Language Models Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner</description>

      <title>Breaking the Bias: Recalibrating the Attention of Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the scarcity and unpredictable nature of defect samples, industrial anomaly detection (IAD) predominantly employs unsupervised learning. However, all unsupervised IAD methods face a common challenge: the inherent bias in normal samples, which causes models to focus on variable regions while overlooking potential defects in invariant areas. To effectively overcome this, it is essential to decompose and recalibrate attention, guiding the model to suppress irrelevant variations and concentrate on subtle, defect-susceptible areas. In this paper, we propose Recalibrating Attention of Industrial Anomaly Detection (RAAD), a framework that systematically decomposes and recalibrates attention maps. RAAD employs a two-stage process: first, it reduces attention bias through quantization, and second, it fine-tunes defect-prone regions for improved sensitivity. Central to this framework is Hierarchical Quantization Scoring (HQS), which dynamically allocates bit-widths across layers based on their anomaly detection contributions. HQS dynamically adjusts bit-widths based on the hierarchical nature of attention maps, compressing lower layers that produce coarse and noisy attention while preserving deeper layers with sharper, defect-focused attention. This approach optimizes both computational efficiency and the model' s sensitivity to anomalies. We validate the effectiveness of RAAD on 32 datasets using a single 3090ti. Experiments demonstrate that RAAD, balances the complexity and expressive power of the model, enhancing its anomaly detection capability.</description>

      <title>SAFIRE: Segment Any Forged Image Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most techniques approach the problem of image forgery localization as a binary segmentation task, training neural networks to label original areas as 0 and forged areas as 1. In contrast, we tackle this issue from a more fundamental perspective by partitioning images according to their originating sources. To this end, we propose Segment Any Forged Image Region (SAFIRE), which solves forgery localization using point prompting. Each point on an image is used to segment the source region containing itself. This allows us to partition images into multiple source regions, a capability achieved for the first time. Additionally, rather than memorizing certain forgery traces, SAFIRE naturally focuses on uniform characteristics within each source region. This approach leads to more stable and effective learning, achieving superior performance in both the new task and the traditional binary forgery localization.</description>

      <title>GN-FR:Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flare, an optical phenomenon resulting from unwanted scattering and reflections within a lens system, presents a significant challenge in imaging. The diverse patterns of flares, such as halos, streaks, color bleeding, and haze, complicate the flare removal process. Existing traditional and learning-based methods have exhibited limited efficacy due to their reliance on single-image approaches, where flare removal is highly ill-posed. We address this by framing flare removal as a multi-view image problem, taking advantage of the view-dependent nature of flare artifacts. This approach leverages information from neighboring views to recover details obscured by flare in individual images. Our proposed framework, GN-FR (Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal), can render flare-free views from a sparse set of input images affected by lens flare and generalizes across different scenes in an unsupervised manner. GN-FR incorporates several modules within the Generalizable NeRF Transformer (GNT) framework: Flare-occupancy Mask Generation (FMG), View Sampler (VS), and Point Sampler (PS). To overcome the impracticality of capturing both flare-corrupted and flare-free data, we introduce a masking loss function that utilizes mask information in an unsupervised setting. Additionally, we present a 3D multi-view flare dataset, comprising 17 real flare scenes with 782 images, 80 real flare patterns, and their corresponding annotated flare-occupancy masks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address flare removal within a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevalent lossy image compression schemes can be divided into: 1) explicit image compression (EIC), including traditional standards and neural end-to-end algorithms; 2) implicit image compression (IIC) based on implicit neural representations (INR). The former is encountering impasses of either leveling off bitrate reduction at a cost of tremendous complexity while the latter suffers from excessive smoothing quality as well as lengthy decoder models. In this paper, we propose an innovative paradigm, which we dub \textbf{Unicorn} (\textbf{U}nified \textbf{N}eural \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}ompression with \textbf{O}ne \textbf{N}number \textbf{R}econstruction). By conceptualizing the images as index-image pairs and learning the inherent distribution of pairs in a subtle neural network model, Unicorn can reconstruct a visually pleasing image from a randomly generated noise with only one index number. The neural model serves as the unified decoder of images while the noises and indexes corresponds to explicit representations. As a proof of concept, we propose an effective and efficient prototype of Unicorn based on latent diffusion models with tailored model designs. Quantitive and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our prototype achieves significant bitrates reduction compared with EIC and IIC algorithms. More impressively, benefitting from the unified decoder, our compression ratio escalates as the quantity of images increases. We envision that more advanced model designs will endow Unicorn with greater potential in image compression. We will release our codes in \url{https://github.com/uniqzheng/Unicorn-Laduree}.</description>

      <title>Generate Any Scene: Evaluating and Improving Text-to-Vision Generation with Scene Graph Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DALL-E and Sora have gained attention by producing implausible images, such as "astronauts riding a horse in space." Despite the proliferation of text-to-vision models that have inundated the internet with synthetic visuals, from images to 3D assets, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate these models on real-world scenes paired with captions. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a framework that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing a vast array of visual scenes, spanning realistic to imaginative compositions. Generate Any Scene leverages 'scene graph programming', a method for dynamically constructing scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of visual elements. This taxonomy includes numerous objects, attributes, and relations, enabling the synthesis of an almost infinite variety of scene graphs. Using these structured representations, Generate Any Scene translates each scene graph into a caption, enabling scalable evaluation of text-to-vision models through standard metrics. We conduct extensive evaluations across multiple text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D models, presenting key findings on model performance. We find that DiT-backbone text-to-image models align more closely with input captions than UNet-backbone models. Text-to-video models struggle with balancing dynamics and consistency, while both text-to-video and text-to-3D models show notable gaps in human preference alignment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Generate Any Scene by conducting three practical applications leveraging captions generated by Generate Any Scene: 1) a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data, 2) a distillation process to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to open-source counterparts, and 3) improvements in content moderation by identifying and generating challenging synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Classification for Automated Image Annotation of Coral Reef Benthic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated benthic image annotation is crucial to efficiently monitor and protect coral reefs against climate change. Current machine learning approaches fail to capture the hierarchical nature of benthic organisms covering reef substrata, i.e., coral taxonomic levels and health condition. To address this limitation, we propose to annotate benthic images using hierarchical classification. Experiments on a custom dataset from a Northeast Brazilian coral reef show that our approach outperforms flat classifiers, improving both F1 and hierarchical F1 scores by approximately 2\% across varying amounts of training data. In addition, this hierarchical method aligns more closely with ecological objectives.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modality-Camera Invariant Clustering for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) offers a more flexible and cost-effective alternative compared to supervised methods. This field has gained increasing attention due to its promising potential. Existing methods simply cluster modality-specific samples and employ strong association techniques to achieve instance-to-cluster or cluster-to-cluster cross-modality associations. However, they ignore cross-camera differences, leading to noticeable issues with excessive splitting of identities. Consequently, this undermines the accuracy and reliability of cross-modal associations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Dynamic Modality-Camera Invariant Clustering (DMIC) framework for USL-VI-ReID. Specifically, our DMIC naturally integrates Modality-Camera Invariant Expansion (MIE), Dynamic Neighborhood Clustering (DNC) and Hybrid Modality Contrastive Learning (HMCL) into a unified framework, which eliminates both the cross-modality and cross-camera discrepancies in clustering. MIE fuses inter-modal and inter-camera distance coding to bridge the gaps between modalities and cameras at the clustering level. DNC employs two dynamic search strategies to refine the network's optimization objective, transitioning from improving discriminability to enhancing cross-modal and cross-camera generalizability. Moreover, HMCL is designed to optimize instance-level and cluster-level distributions. Memories for intra-modality and inter-modality training are updated using randomly selected samples, facilitating real-time exploration of modality-invariant representations. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our DMIC addresses the limitations present in current clustering approaches and achieve competitive performance, which significantly reduces the performance gap with supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Context Alignment with Disentangled Geometric and Temporal Modeling for Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) is crucial for understanding complex 3D scenes from limited 2D image observations. Existing SOP methods typically aggregate contextual features to assist the occupancy representation learning, alleviating issues like occlusion or ambiguity. However, these solutions often face misalignment issues wherein the corresponding features at the same position across different frames may have different semantic meanings during the aggregation process, which leads to unreliable contextual fusion results and an unstable representation learning process. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hierarchical context alignment paradigm for a more accurate SOP (Hi-SOP). Hi-SOP first disentangles the geometric and temporal context for separate alignment, which two branches are then composed to enhance the reliability of SOP. This parsing of the visual input into a local-global alignment hierarchy includes: (I) disentangled geometric and temporal separate alignment, within each leverages depth confidence and camera pose as prior for relevant feature matching respectively; (II) global alignment and composition of the transformed geometric and temporal volumes based on semantics consistency. Our method outperforms SOTAs for semantic scene completion on the SemanticKITTI &amp; NuScenes-Occupancy datasets and LiDAR semantic segmentation on the NuScenes dataset.</description>

      <title>Neural Observation Field Guided Hybrid Optimization of Camera Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera placement is crutial in multi-camera systems such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and high-quality reconstruction. The camera placement challenge lies in the nonlinear nature of high-dimensional parameters and the unavailability of gradients for target functions like coverage and visibility. Consequently, most existing methods tackle this challenge by leveraging non-gradient-based optimization methods.In this work, we present a hybrid camera placement optimization approach that incorporates both gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimization methods. This design allows our method to enjoy the advantages of smooth optimization convergence and robustness from gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimization, respectively. To bridge the two disparate optimization methods, we propose a neural observation field, which implicitly encodes the coverage and observation quality. The neural observation field provides the measurements of the camera observations and corresponding gradients without the assumption of target scenes, making our method applicable to diverse scenarios, including 2D planar shapes, 3D objects, and room-scale 3D scenes.Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while requiring only a fraction (8x less) of the typical computation time. Furthermore, we conducted a real-world experiment using a custom-built capture system, confirming the resilience of our approach to real-world environmental noise.</description>

      <title>Position-aware Guided Point Cloud Completion with CLIP Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover partial geometric and topological shapes caused by equipment defects or limited viewpoints. Current methods either solely rely on the 3D coordinates of the point cloud to complete it or incorporate additional images with well-calibrated intrinsic parameters to guide the geometric estimation of the missing parts. Although these methods have achieved excellent performance by directly predicting the location of complete points, the extracted features lack fine-grained information regarding the location of the missing area. To address this issue, we propose a rapid and efficient method to expand an unimodal framework into a multimodal framework. This approach incorporates a position-aware module designed to enhance the spatial information of the missing parts through a weighted map learning mechanism. In addition, we establish a Point-Text-Image triplet corpus PCI-TI and MVP-TI based on the existing unimodal point cloud completion dataset and use the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP to provide richer detail information for 3D shapes, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.</description>

      <title>Local Features Meet Stochastic Anonymization: Revolutionizing Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition for Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) currently faces two major unsolved challenges: (1) existing methods are typically effective only on specific face recognition models and struggle to generalize to black-box face recognition models; (2) current methods employ data-driven reversible representation encoding for privacy protection, making them susceptible to adversarial learning and reconstruction of the original image. We observe that face recognition models primarily rely on local features ({e.g., face contour, skin texture, and so on) for identification. Thus, by disrupting global features while enhancing local features, we achieve effective recognition even in black-box environments. Additionally, to prevent adversarial models from learning and reversing the anonymization process, we adopt an adversarial learning-based approach with irreversible stochastic injection to ensure the stochastic nature of the anonymization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an average recognition accuracy of 94.21\% on black-box models, outperforming existing methods in both privacy protection and anti-reconstruction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Template Matters: Understanding the Role of Instruction Templates in Multimodal Language Model Evaluation and Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multimodal language models (MLMs) evaluation and training approaches overlook the influence of instruction format, presenting an elephant-in-the-room problem. Previous research deals with this problem by manually crafting instructions, failing to yield significant insights due to limitations in diversity and scalability. In this work, we propose a programmatic instruction template generator capable of producing over 39B unique template combinations by filling randomly sampled positional synonyms into weighted sampled meta templates, enabling us to comprehensively examine the MLM's performance across diverse instruction templates. Our experiments across eight common MLMs on five benchmark datasets reveal that MLMs have high template sensitivities with at most 29% performance gaps between different templates. We further augment the instruction tuning dataset of LLaVA-1.5 with our template generator and perform instruction tuning on LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B. Models tuned on our augmented dataset achieve the best overall performance when compared with the same scale MLMs tuned on at most 75 times the scale of our augmented dataset, highlighting the importance of instruction templates in MLM training.

      <title>Post-Hoc MOTS: Exploring the Capabilities of Time-Symmetric Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal forward-tracking has been the dominant approach for multi-object segmentation and tracking (MOTS). However, a novel time-symmetric tracking methodology has recently been introduced for the detection, segmentation, and tracking of budding yeast cells in pre-recorded samples. Although this architecture has demonstrated a unique perspective on stable and consistent tracking, as well as missed instance re-interpolation, its evaluation has so far been largely confined to settings related to videomicroscopic environments. In this work, we aim to reveal the broader capabilities, advantages, and potential challenges of this architecture across various specifically designed scenarios, including a pedestrian tracking dataset. We also conduct an ablation study comparing the model against its restricted variants and the widely used Kalman filter. Furthermore, we present an attention analysis of the tracking architecture for both pretrained and non-pretrained models</description>

      <title>Lightweight Method for Interactive 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-Round Result Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, precise annotation of lesions or organs is often required. However, 3D volumetric images typically consist of hundreds or thousands of slices, making the annotation process extremely time-consuming and laborious. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has drawn widespread attention due to its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities in interactive segmentation. While researchers have explored adapting SAM for medical applications, such as using SAM adapters or constructing 3D SAM models, a key question remains: Can traditional CNN networks achieve the same strong zero-shot generalization in this task? In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Interactive Network for 3D Medical Image Segmentation (LIM-Net), a novel approach demonstrating the potential of compact CNN-based models. Built upon a 2D CNN backbone, LIM-Net initiates segmentation by generating a 2D prompt mask from user hints. This mask is then propagated through the 3D sequence via the Memory Module. To refine and stabilize results during interaction, the Multi-Round Result Fusion (MRF) Module selects and merges optimal masks from multiple rounds. Our extensive experiments across multiple datasets and modalities demonstrate LIM-Net's competitive performance. It exhibits stronger generalization to unseen data compared to SAM-based models, with competitive accuracy while requiring fewer interactions. Notably, LIM-Net's lightweight design offers significant advantages in deployment and inference efficiency, with low GPU memory consumption suitable for resource-constrained environments. These promising results demonstrate LIM-Net can serve as a strong baseline, complementing and contrasting with popular SAM models to further boost effective interactive medical image segmentation. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/goodtime-123/LIM-Net}.</description>

      <title>Digging into Intrinsic Contextual Information for High-fidelity 3D Point Cloud Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common occurrence of occlusion-induced incompleteness in point clouds has made point cloud completion (PCC) a highly-concerned task in the field of geometric processing. Existing PCC methods typically produce complete point clouds from partial point clouds in a coarse-to-fine paradigm, with the coarse stage generating entire shapes and the fine stage improving texture details. Though diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in the coarse stage, the fine stage still faces challenges in producing high-fidelity results due to the ill-posed nature of PCC. The intrinsic contextual information for texture details in partial point clouds is the key to solving the challenge. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity PCC method that digs into both short and long-range contextual information from the partial point cloud in the fine stage. Specifically, after generating the coarse point cloud via a diffusion-based coarse generator, a mixed sampling module introduces short-range contextual information from partial point clouds into the fine stage. A surface freezing modules safeguards points from noise-free partial point clouds against disruption. As for the long-range contextual information, we design a similarity modeling module to derive similarity with rigid transformation invariance between points, conducting effective matching of geometric manifold features globally. In this way, the high-quality components present in the partial point cloud serve as valuable references for refining the coarse point cloud with high fidelity. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over SOTA competitors. Our code is available at https://github.com/JS-CHU/ContextualCompletion.</description>

      <title>SLGaussian: Fast Language Gaussian Splatting in Sparse Views</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D semantic field learning is crucial for applications like autonomous navigation, AR/VR, and robotics, where accurate comprehension of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints is essential. Existing methods struggle under sparse view conditions, relying on inefficient per-scene multi-view optimizations, which are impractical for many real-world tasks. To address this, we propose SLGaussian, a feed-forward method for constructing 3D semantic fields from sparse viewpoints, allowing direct inference of 3DGS-based scenes. By ensuring consistent SAM segmentations through video tracking and using low-dimensional indexing for high-dimensional CLIP features, SLGaussian efficiently embeds language information in 3D space, offering a robust solution for accurate 3D scene understanding under sparse view conditions. In experiments on two-view sparse 3D object querying and segmentation in the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets, SLGaussian outperforms existing methods in chosen IoU, Localization Accuracy, and mIoU. Moreover, our model achieves scene inference in under 30 seconds and open-vocabulary querying in just 0.011 seconds per query.</description>

      <title>ALoRE: Efficient Visual Adaptation via Aggregating Low Rank Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has become a promising paradigm for adapting large-scale vision foundation models to downstream tasks. Typical methods primarily leverage the intrinsic low rank property to make decomposition, learning task-specific weights while compressing parameter size. However, such approaches predominantly manipulate within the original feature space utilizing a single-branch structure, which might be suboptimal for decoupling the learned representations and patterns. In this paper, we propose ALoRE, a novel PETL method that reuses the hypercomplex parameterized space constructed by Kronecker product to Aggregate Low Rank Experts using a multi-branch paradigm, disentangling the learned cognitive patterns during training. Thanks to the artful design, ALoRE maintains negligible extra parameters and can be effortlessly merged into the frozen backbone via re-parameterization in a sequential manner, avoiding additional inference latency. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 image classification tasks using various backbone variants. Experimental results demonstrate that ALoRE outperforms the full fine-tuning strategy and other state-of-the-art PETL methods in terms of performance and parameter efficiency. For instance, ALoRE obtains 3.06% and 9.97% Top-1 accuracy improvement on average compared to full fine-tuning on the FGVC datasets and VTAB-1k benchmark by only updating 0.15M parameters.</description>

Abstract: Current collaborative perception methods often rely on fully annotated datasets, which can be expensive to obtain in practical situations. To reduce annotation costs, some works adopt sparsely supervised learning techniques and generate pseudo labels for the missing instances. However, these methods fail to achieve an optimal confidence threshold that harmonizes the quality and quantity of pseudo labels. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Collaborative perception Dual Teacher-Student framework (CoDTS), which employs adaptive complementary learning to produce both high-quality and high-quantity pseudo labels. Specifically, the Main Foreground Mining (MFM) module generates high-quality pseudo labels based on the prediction of the static teacher. Subsequently, the Supplement Foreground Mining (SFM) module ensures a balance between the quality and quantity of pseudo labels by adaptively identifying missing instances based on the prediction of the dynamic teacher. Additionally, the Neighbor Anchor Sampling (NAS) module is incorporated to enhance the representation of pseudo labels. To promote the adaptive complementary learning, we implement a staged training strategy that trains the student and dynamic teacher in a mutually beneficial manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDTS effectively ensures an optimal balance of pseudo labels in both quality and quantity, establishing a new state-of-the-art in sparsely supervised collaborative perception.</description>

      <title>Video Summarization using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to eliminate visual redundancy while retaining key parts of video to construct concise and comprehensive synopses. Most existing methods use discriminative models to predict the importance scores of video frames. However, these methods are susceptible to annotation inconsistency caused by the inherent subjectivity of different annotators when annotating the same video. In this paper, we introduce a generative framework for video summarization that learns how to generate summaries from a probability distribution perspective, effectively reducing the interference of subjective annotation noise. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion summarization method based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which learns the probability distribution of training data through noise prediction, and generates summaries by iterative denoising. Our method is more resistant to subjective annotation noise, and is less prone to overfitting the training data than discriminative methods, with strong generalization ability. Moreover, to facilitate training DDPM with limited data, we employ an unsupervised video summarization model to implement the earlier denoising process. Extensive experiments on various datasets (TVSum, SumMe, and FPVSum) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Reloc3r: Large-Scale Training of Relative Camera Pose Regression for Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual localization aims to determine the camera pose of a query image relative to a database of posed images. In recent years, deep neural networks that directly regress camera poses have gained popularity due to their fast inference capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to either generalize well to new scenes or provide accurate camera pose estimates. To address these issues, we present \textbf{Reloc3r}, a simple yet effective visual localization framework. It consists of an elegantly designed relative pose regression network, and a minimalist motion averaging module for absolute pose estimation. Trained on approximately 8 million posed image pairs, Reloc3r achieves surprisingly good performance and generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 public datasets, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It provides high-quality camera pose estimates in real time and generalizes to novel scenes. Code, weights, and data at: \url{https://github.com/ffrivera0/reloc3r}.</description>

      <title>HyViLM: Enhancing Fine-Grained Recognition with a Hybrid Encoder for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</description>

      <title>LOMA: Language-assisted Semantic Occupancy Network via Triplane Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has become a popular research task due to its versatility and affordability. Nowadays, conventional methods usually project the image-based vision features to 3D space and learn the geometric information through the attention mechanism, enabling the 3D semantic occupancy prediction. However, these works usually face two main challenges: 1) Limited geometric information. Due to the lack of geometric information in the image itself, it is challenging to directly predict 3D space information, especially in large-scale outdoor scenes. 2) Local restricted interaction. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, they often use modified local attention to fuse features, resulting in a restricted fusion. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a language-assisted 3D semantic occupancy prediction network, named LOMA. In the proposed vision-language framework, we first introduce a VL-aware Scene Generator (VSG) module to generate the 3D language feature of the scene. By leveraging the vision-language model, this module provides implicit geometric knowledge and explicit semantic information from the language. Furthermore, we present a Tri-plane Fusion Mamba (TFM) block to efficiently fuse the 3D language feature and 3D vision feature. The proposed module not only fuses the two features with global modeling but also avoids too much computation costs. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets show that our algorithm achieves new state-of-the-art performances in both geometric and semantic completion tasks. Our code will be open soon.</description>

      <title>Embedding and Enriching Explicit Semantics for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) retrieves pedestrian images with the same identity across different modalities. Existing methods learn visual content solely from images, lacking the capability to sense high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an Embedding and Enriching Explicit Semantics (EEES) framework to learn semantically rich cross-modality pedestrian representations. Our method offers several contributions. First, with the collaboration of multiple large language-vision models, we develop Explicit Semantics Embedding (ESE), which automatically supplements language descriptions for pedestrians and aligns image-text pairs into a common space, thereby learning visual content associated with explicit semantics. Second, recognizing the complementarity of multi-view information, we present Cross-View Semantics Compensation (CVSC), which constructs multi-view image-text pair representations, establishes their many-to-many matching, and propagates knowledge to single-view representations, thus compensating visual content with its missing cross-view semantics. Third, to eliminate noisy semantics such as conflicting color attributes in different modalities, we design Cross-Modality Semantics Purification (CMSP), which constrains the distance between inter-modality image-text pair representations to be close to that between intra-modality image-text pair representations, further enhancing the modality-invariance of visual content. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed EEES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires robust perception models trained on high-quality, large-scale multi-view driving videos for tasks like 3D object detection, segmentation and trajectory prediction. While world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, challenges remain in ensuring these videos adhere to fundamental physical principles, such as relative and absolute motion, spatial relationship like occlusion and spatial consistency, and temporal consistency. To address these, we propose DrivePhysica, an innovative model designed to generate realistic multi-view driving videos that accurately adhere to essential physical principles through three key advancements: (1) a Coordinate System Aligner module that integrates relative and absolute motion features to enhance motion interpretation, (2) an Instance Flow Guidance module that ensures precise temporal consistency via efficient 3D flow extraction, and (3) a Box Coordinate Guidance module that improves spatial relationship understanding and accurately resolves occlusion hierarchies. Grounded in physical principles, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in driving video generation quality (3.96 FID and 38.06 FVD on the Nuscenes dataset) and downstream perception tasks.

      <title>Pragmatist: Multiview Conditional Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Sparse Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring 3D structures from sparse, unposed observations is challenging due to its unconstrained nature. Recent methods propose to predict implicit representations directly from unposed inputs in a data-driven manner, achieving promising results. However, these methods do not utilize geometric priors and cannot hallucinate the appearance of unseen regions, thus making it challenging to reconstruct fine geometric and textural details. To tackle this challenge, our key idea is to reformulate this ill-posed problem as conditional novel view synthesis, aiming to generate complete observations from limited input views to facilitate reconstruction. With complete observations, the poses of the input views can be easily recovered and further used to optimize the reconstructed object. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline Pragmatist. First, we generate a complete observation of the object via a multiview conditional diffusion model. Then, we use a feed-forward large reconstruction model to obtain the reconstructed mesh. To further improve the reconstruction quality, we recover the poses of input views by inverting the obtained 3D representations and further optimize the texture using detailed input views. Unlike previous approaches, our pipeline improves reconstruction by efficiently leveraging unposed inputs and generative priors, circumventing the direct resolution of highly ill-posed problems. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves promising performance in several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PointCFormer: a Relation-based Progressive Feature Extraction Network for Point Cloud Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct the complete 3D shape from incomplete point clouds, and it is crucial for tasks such as 3D object detection and segmentation. Despite the continuous advances in point cloud analysis techniques, feature extraction methods are still confronted with apparent limitations. The sparse sampling of point clouds, used as inputs in most methods, often results in a certain loss of global structure information. Meanwhile, traditional local feature extraction methods usually struggle to capture the intricate geometric details. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce PointCFormer, a transformer framework optimized for robust global retention and precise local detail capture in point cloud completion. This framework embraces several key advantages. First, we propose a relation-based local feature extraction method to perceive local delicate geometry characteristics. This approach establishes a fine-grained relationship metric between the target point and its k-nearest neighbors, quantifying each neighboring point's contribution to the target point's local features. Secondly, we introduce a progressive feature extractor that integrates our local feature perception method with self-attention. Starting with a denser sampling of points as input, it iteratively queries long-distance global dependencies and local neighborhood relationships. This extractor maintains enhanced global structure and refined local details, without generating substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we develop a correction module after generating point proxies in the latent space to reintroduce denser information from the input points, enhancing the representation capability of the point proxies. PointCFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several widely used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Disentangled Fusion Network for RGBT Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGBT tracking usually suffers from various challenging factors of low resolution, similar appearance, extreme illumination, thermal crossover and occlusion, to name a few. Existing works often study complex fusion models to handle challenging scenarios, but can not well adapt to various challenges, which might limit tracking performance. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Dynamic Disentangled Fusion Network called DDFNet, which disentangles the fusion process into several dynamic fusion models via the challenge attributes to adapt to various challenging scenarios, for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, we design six attribute-based fusion models to integrate RGB and thermal features under the six challenging scenarios respectively.Since each fusion model is to deal with the corresponding challenges, such disentangled fusion scheme could increase the fusion capacity without the dependence on large-scale training data. Considering that every challenging scenario also has different levels of difficulty, we propose to optimize the combination of multiple fusion units to form each attribute-based fusion model in a dynamic manner, which could well adapt to the difficulty of the corresponding challenging scenario. To address the issue that which fusion models should be activated in the tracking process, we design an adaptive aggregation fusion module to integrate all features from attribute-based fusion models in an adaptive manner with a three-stage training algorithm. In addition, we design an enhancement fusion module to further strengthen the aggregated feature and modality-specific features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDFNet against other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>POINTS1.5: Building a Vision-Language Model towards Real World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have made significant strides recently, demonstrating superior performance across a range of tasks, e.g. optical character recognition and complex diagram analysis. Building on this trend, we introduce a new vision-language model, POINTS1.5, designed to excel in various real-world applications. POINTS1.5 is an enhancement of POINTS1.0 and incorporates several key innovations: i) We replace the original CLIP vision encoder, which had a fixed image resolution, with a NaViT-style vision encoder that supports native dynamic high resolution. This allows POINTS1.5 to process images of any resolution without needing to split them into tiles. ii) We add bilingual support to POINTS1.5, significantly enhancing its capability in Chinese. Due to the scarcity of open-source Chinese datasets for vision-language models, we collect numerous images from the Internet and annotate them using a combination of manual and automatic methods. iii) We propose a set of rigorous filtering methods for visual instruction tuning datasets. We comprehensively evaluate all these filtering methods, and choose the most effective ones to obtain the final visual instruction tuning set. Thanks to these innovations, POINTS1.5 significantly outperforms POINTS1.0 and demonstrates strong performance across a range of real-world applications. Notably, POINTS1.5-7B is trained on fewer than 4 billion tokens and ranks first on the OpenCompass leaderboard among models with fewer than 10 billion parameters</description>

      <title>CC-Diff: Enhancing Contextual Coherence in Remote Sensing Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately depicting real-world landscapes in remote sensing (RS) images requires precise alignment between objects and their environment. However, most existing synthesis methods for natural images prioritize foreground control, often reducing the background to plain textures. This neglects the interaction between foreground and background, which can lead to incoherence in RS scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CC-Diff, a Diffusion Model-based approach for RS image generation with enhanced Context Coherence. To capture spatial interdependence, we propose a sequential pipeline where background generation is conditioned on synthesized foreground instances. Distinct learnable queries are also employed to model both the complex background texture and its semantic relation to the foreground. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and positional precision, excelling in both RS and natural image domains. CC-Diff also shows strong trainability, improving detection accuracy by 2.04 mAP on DOTA and 2.25 mAP on the COCO benchmark.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</description>

      <title>Accurate Water Level Monitoring in AWD Rice Cultivation Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) method is a rice-growing water management technique promoted as a sustainable alternative to Continuous Flooding (CF). Climate change has placed the agricultural sector in a challenging position, particularly as global water resources become increasingly scarce, affecting rice production on irrigated lowlands. Rice, a staple food for over half of the world's population, demands significantly more water than other major crops. In Bangladesh, \textit{Boro} rice, in particular, requires considerable water inputs during its cultivation. Traditionally, farmers manually measure water levels, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. While ultrasonic sensors offer improvements in water height measurement, they still face limitations, such as susceptibility to weather conditions and environmental factors. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that automates water height measurement using computer vision, specifically through a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention-based architecture achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.9885 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.2766, providing a more accurate and efficient solution for managing AWD systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to unseen target domains, even in the presence of domain shifts. Achieving effective generalization typically requires a large and diverse set of labeled source data to learn robust representations that can generalize to new, unseen domains. However, obtaining such high-quality labeled data is often costly and labor-intensive, limiting the practical applicability of DG. To address this, we investigate a more practical and challenging problem: semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) under a label-efficient paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel method, CAT, which leverages semi-supervised learning with limited labeled data to achieve competitive generalization performance under domain shifts. Our method addresses key limitations of previous approaches, such as reliance on fixed thresholds and sensitivity to noisy pseudo-labels. CAT combines adaptive thresholding with noisy label refinement techniques, creating a straightforward yet highly effective solution for SSDG tasks. Specifically, our approach uses flexible thresholding to generate high-quality pseudo-labels with higher class diversity while refining noisy pseudo-labels to improve their reliability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving robust generalization under domain shift.</description>

      <title>InvDiff: Invariant Guidance for Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most successful generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in synthesizing high-quality images. These models learn the underlying high-dimensional data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Despite their success, diffusion models are highly data-driven and prone to inheriting the imbalances and biases present in real-world data. Some studies have attempted to address these issues by designing text prompts for known biases or using bias labels to construct unbiased data. While these methods have shown improved results, real-world scenarios often contain various unknown biases, and obtaining bias labels is particularly challenging. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of mitigating bias in pre-trained diffusion models without relying on auxiliary bias annotations. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework, InvDiff, which aims to learn invariant semantic information for diffusion guidance. Specifically, we propose identifying underlying biases in the training data and designing a novel debiasing training objective. Then, we employ a lightweight trainable module that automatically preserves invariant semantic information and uses it to guide the diffusion model's sampling process toward unbiased outcomes simultaneously. Notably, we only need to learn a small number of parameters in the lightweight learnable module without altering the pre-trained diffusion model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the implementation of InvDiff is equivalent to reducing the error upper bound of generalization. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that InvDiff effectively reduces biases while maintaining the quality of image generation.

      <title>SAM-Mamba: Mamba Guided SAM Architecture for Generalized Zero-Shot Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is crucial for detecting colorectal cancer. However, it is challenging due to variations in the structure, color, and size of polyps, as well as the lack of clear boundaries with surrounding tissues. Traditional segmentation models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture detailed patterns and global context, limiting their performance. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models address some of these issues but have difficulties in capturing local context and lack strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we propose the Mamba-guided Segment Anything Model (SAM-Mamba) for efficient polyp segmentation. Our approach introduces a Mamba-Prior module in the encoder to bridge the gap between the general pre-trained representation of SAM and polyp-relevant trivial clues. It injects salient cues of polyp images into the SAM image encoder as a domain prior while capturing global dependencies at various scales, leading to more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that SAM-Mamba outperforms traditional CNN, ViT, and Adapter-based models in both quantitative and qualitative measures. Additionally, SAM-Mamba demonstrates excellent adaptability to unseen datasets, making it highly suitable for real-time clinical use.</description>

      <title>Learning Flow Fields in Attention for Controllable Person Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person's appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Module Denoising Approach with Curriculum Learning for Enhancing Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) combines text and images to perform sentiment analysis but often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual information. Existing methodologies typically address either sentence-image denoising or aspect-image denoising but fail to comprehensively tackle both types of noise. To address these limitations, we propose DualDe, a novel approach comprising two distinct components: the Hybrid Curriculum Denoising Module (HCD) and the Aspect-Enhance Denoising Module (AED). The HCD module enhances sentence-image denoising by incorporating a flexible curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes training on clean data. Concurrently, the AED module mitigates aspect-image noise through an aspect-guided attention mechanism that filters out noisy visual regions which unrelated to the specific aspects of interest. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness in addressing both sentence-image and aspect-image noise, as evidenced by experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>StyleStudio: Text-Driven Style Transfer with Selective Control of Style Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-driven style transfer aims to merge the style of a reference image with content described by a text prompt. Recent advancements in text-to-image models have improved the nuance of style transformations, yet significant challenges remain, particularly with overfitting to reference styles, limiting stylistic control, and misaligning with textual content. In this paper, we propose three complementary strategies to address these issues. First, we introduce a cross-modal Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) mechanism for better integration of style and text features, enhancing alignment. Second, we develop a Style-based Classifier-Free Guidance (SCFG) approach that enables selective control over stylistic elements, reducing irrelevant influences. Finally, we incorporate a teacher model during early generation stages to stabilize spatial layouts and mitigate artifacts. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in style transfer quality and alignment with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach can be integrated into existing style transfer frameworks without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating the Symphony of Prompt Distribution Learning for Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detectors with popular query-transformer architecture have achieved promising performance. However, accurately identifying uncommon visual patterns and distinguishing between ambiguous HOIs continue to be difficult for them. We observe that these difficulties may arise from the limited capacity of traditional detector queries in representing diverse intra-category patterns and inter-category dependencies. To address this, we introduce the Interaction Prompt Distribution Learning (InterProDa) approach. InterProDa learns multiple sets of soft prompts and estimates category distributions from various prompts. It then incorporates HOI queries with category distributions, making them capable of representing near-infinite intra-category dynamics and universal cross-category relationships. Our InterProDa detector demonstrates competitive performance on HICO-DET and vcoco benchmarks. Additionally, our method can be integrated into most transformer-based HOI detectors, significantly enhancing their performance with minimal additional parameters.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Fields and Deformation Models for Non-Rigid 3D Motion Reconstruction from Partial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, data-driven approach for reconstructing temporally coherent 3D motion from unstructured and potentially partial observations of non-rigidly deforming shapes. Our goal is to achieve high-fidelity motion reconstructions for shapes that undergo near-isometric deformations, such as humans wearing loose clothing. The key novelty of our work lies in its ability to combine implicit shape representations with explicit mesh-based deformation models, enabling detailed and temporally coherent motion reconstructions without relying on parametric shape models or decoupling shape and motion. Each frame is represented as a neural field decoded from a feature space where observations over time are fused, hence preserving geometric details present in the input data. Temporal coherence is enforced with a near-isometric deformation constraint between adjacent frames that applies to the underlying surface in the neural field. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated by its application to human and animal motion sequences reconstructed from monocular depth videos.</description>

      <title>Learning to Decouple the Lights for 3D Face Texture Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research has made impressive strides in reconstructing human facial shapes and textures from images with well-illuminated faces and minimal external occlusions. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to recover accurate facial textures from scenarios with complicated illumination affected by external occlusions, e.g. a face that is partially obscured by items such as a hat. Existing works based on the assumption of single and uniform illumination cannot correctly process these data. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to model 3D facial textures under such unnatural illumination. Instead of assuming single illumination, our framework learns to imitate the unnatural illumination as a composition of multiple separate light conditions combined with learned neural representations, named Light Decoupling. According to experiments on both single images and video sequences, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in modeling facial textures under challenging illumination affected by occlusions.

      <title>SenCLIP: Enhancing zero-shot land-use mapping for Sentinel-2 with ground-level prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive zero-shot classification capabilities with free-form prompts and even show some generalization in specialized domains. However, their performance on satellite imagery is limited due to the underrepresentation of such data in their training sets, which predominantly consist of ground-level images. Existing prompting techniques for satellite imagery are often restricted to generic phrases like a satellite image of ..., limiting their effectiveness for zero-shot land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. To address these challenges, we introduce SenCLIP, which transfers CLIPs representation to Sentinel-2 imagery by leveraging a large dataset of Sentinel-2 images paired with geotagged ground-level photos from across Europe. We evaluate SenCLIP alongside other SOTA remote sensing VLMs on zero-shot LULC mapping tasks using the EuroSAT and BigEarthNet datasets with both aerial and ground-level prompting styles. Our approach, which aligns ground-level representations with satellite imagery, demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy across both prompt styles, opening new possibilities for applying free-form textual descriptions in zero-shot LULC mapping.</description>

      <title>Improving Satellite Imagery Masking using Multi-task and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many remote sensing applications employ masking of pixels in satellite imagery for subsequent measurements. For example, estimating water quality variables, such as Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) requires isolating pixels depicting water bodies unaffected by clouds, their shadows, terrain shadows, and snow and ice formation. A significant bottleneck is the reliance on a variety of data products (e.g., satellite imagery, elevation maps), and a lack of precision in individual steps affecting estimation accuracy. We propose to improve both the accuracy and computational efficiency of masking by developing a system that predicts all required masks from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) imagery. Our model employs multi-tasking to share computation and enable higher accuracy across tasks. We experiment with recent advances in deep network architectures and show that masking models can benefit from these, especially when combined with pre-training on large satellite imagery datasets. We present a collection of models offering different speed/accuracy trade-offs for masking. MobileNet variants are the fastest, and perform competitively with larger architectures. Transformer-based architectures are the slowest, but benefit the most from pre-training on large satellite imagery datasets. Our models provide a 9% F1 score improvement compared to previous work on water pixel identification. When integrated with an SSC estimation system, our models result in a 30x speedup while reducing estimation error by 2.64 mg/L, allowing for global-scale analysis. We also evaluate our model on a recently proposed cloud and cloud shadow estimation benchmark, where we outperform the current state-of-the-art model by at least 6% in F1 score.</description>

Abstract: Physics-based differentiable rendering (PBDR) has become an efficient method in computer vision, graphics, and machine learning for addressing an array of inverse problems. PBDR allows patterns to be generated from perceptions which can be applied to enhance object attributes like geometry, substances, and lighting by adding physical models of light propagation and materials interaction. Due to these capabilities, distinguished rendering has been employed in a wider range of sectors such as autonomous navigation, scene reconstruction, and material design. We provide an extensive overview of PBDR techniques in this study, emphasizing their creation, effectiveness, and limitations while managing inverse situations. We demonstrate modern techniques and examine their value in everyday situations.</description>

Abstract: Visual programming prompts LLMs (large language mod-els) to generate executable code for visual tasks like visual question answering (VQA). Prompt-based methods are difficult to improve while also being unreliable and costly in both time and money. Our goal is to develop an efficient visual programming system without 1) using prompt-based LLMs at inference time and 2) a large set of program and answer annotations. We develop a synthetic data augmentation approach and alternative program generation method based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills called templates and the corresponding arguments. Our results show that with data augmentation, prompt-free smaller LLMs ($\approx$ 1B parameters) are competitive with state-of-the art models with the added benefit of much faster inference</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fashion industry is increasingly leveraging computer vision and deep learning technologies to enhance online shopping experiences and operational efficiencies. In this paper, we address the challenge of generating high-fidelity tiled garment images essential for personalized recommendations, outfit composition, and virtual try-on systems from photos of garments worn by models. Inspired by the success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image-to-image translation, we propose a novel approach utilizing a fine-tuned StableDiffusion model. Our method features a streamlined single-stage network design, which integrates garmentspecific masks to isolate and process target clothing items effectively. By simplifying the network architecture through selective training of transformer blocks and removing unnecessary crossattention layers, we significantly reduce computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets like VITON-HD. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-quality tiled garment images for both full-body and half-body inputs.

      <title>Annotation-Efficient Task Guidance for Medical Segment Anything</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a key task in the imaging workflow, influencing many image-based decisions. Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient methods of training these models. We propose SAM-Mix, a novel multitask learning framework for medical image segmentation that uses class activation maps produced by an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the SAM framework. Experimental evaluations on the public LiTS dataset confirm the effectiveness of SAM-Mix for simultaneous classification and segmentation of the liver from abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. When trained for 90% fewer epochs on only 50 labeled 2D slices, representing just 0.04% of the available labeled training data, SAM-Mix achieves a Dice improvement of 5.1% over the best baseline model. The generalization results for SAM-Mix are even more impressive, with the same model configuration yielding a 25.4% Dice improvement on a cross-domain segmentation task. Our code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/SAM-Mix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have shown remarkable success in producing high-quality images from text. However, existing T2I models show decayed performance in compositional image generation involving multiple objects and intricate relationships. We attribute this problem to limitations in existing datasets of image-text pairs, which lack precise inter-object relationship annotations with prompts only. To address this problem, we construct LAION-SG, a large-scale dataset with high-quality structural annotations of scene graphs (SG), which precisely describe attributes and relationships of multiple objects, effectively representing the semantic structure in complex scenes. Based on LAION-SG, we train a new foundation model SDXL-SG to incorporate structural annotation information into the generation process. Extensive experiments show advanced models trained on our LAION-SG boast significant performance improvements in complex scene generation over models on existing datasets. We also introduce CompSG-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates models on compositional image generation, establishing a new standard for this domain.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Multi-step Loss for Single Image Reflection Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image reflection removal is crucial for restoring image quality. Distorted images can negatively impact tasks like object detection and image segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for image reflection removal using a single image. Instead of focusing on model architecture, we introduce a new training technique that can be generalized to image-to-image problems, with input and output being similar in nature. This technique is embodied in our multi-step loss mechanism, which has proven effective in the reflection removal task. Additionally, we address the scarcity of reflection removal training data by synthesizing a high-quality, non-linear synthetic dataset called RefGAN using Pix2Pix GAN. This dataset significantly enhances the model's ability to learn better patterns for reflection removal. We also utilize a ranged depth map, extracted from the depth estimation of the ambient image, as an auxiliary feature, leveraging its property of lacking depth estimations for reflections. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the SIR^2 benchmark and other real-world datasets, proving its effectiveness by outperforming other state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>RoomTour3D: Geometry-Aware Video-Instruction Tuning for Embodied Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) suffers from the limited diversity and scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos, we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and 3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.</description>

      <title>ASDnB: Merging Face with Body Cues For Robust Active Speaker Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art Active Speaker Detection (ASD) approaches mainly use audio and facial features as input. However, the main hypothesis in this paper is that body dynamics is also highly correlated to "speaking" (and "listening") actions and should be particularly useful in wild conditions (e.g., surveillance settings), where face cannot be reliably accessed. We propose ASDnB, a model that singularly integrates face with body information by merging the inputs at different steps of feature extraction. Our approach splits 3D convolution into 2D and 1D to reduce computation cost without loss of performance, and is trained with adaptive weight feature importance for improved complement of face with body data. Our experiments show that ASDnB achieves state-of-the-art results in the benchmark dataset (AVA-ActiveSpeaker), in the challenging data of WASD, and in cross-domain settings using Columbia. This way, ASDnB can perform in multiple settings, which is positively regarded as a strong baseline for robust ASD models (code available at https://github.com/Tiago-Roxo/ASDnB).</description>

      <title>Fair Primal Dual Splitting Method for Image Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image inverse problems have numerous applications, including image processing, super-resolution, and computer vision, which are important areas in image science. These application models can be seen as a three-function composite optimization problem solvable by a variety of primal dual-type methods. We propose a fair primal dual algorithmic framework that incorporates the smooth term not only into the primal subproblem but also into the dual subproblem. We unify the global convergence and establish the convergence rates of our proposed fair primal dual method. Experiments on image denoising and super-resolution reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models via Directed Scene Graph for Comprehensive Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating detailed captions comprehending text-rich visual content in images has received growing attention for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Image Retrieval Methods in the Dissimilarity Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image retrieval methods rely on metric learning to train backbone feature extraction models that can extract discriminant queries and reference (gallery) feature representations for similarity matching. Although state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large datasets, image retrieval remains challenging in many real-world video analytics and surveillance applications, e.g., person re-identification. Using the Euclidean space for matching limits the performance in real-world applications due to the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, and sensitivity to noisy data.
  We argue that the feature dissimilarity space is more suitable for similarity matching, and propose a dichotomy transformation to project query and reference embeddings into a single embedding in the dissimilarity space.
  We also advocate for end-to-end training of a backbone and binary classification models for pair-wise matching. As opposed to comparing the distance between queries and reference embeddings, we show the benefits of classifying the single dissimilarity space embedding (as similar or dissimilar), especially when trained end-to-end. We propose a method to train the max-margin classifier together with the backbone feature extractor by applying constraints to the L2 norm of the classifier weights along with the hinge loss.
  Our extensive experiments on challenging image retrieval datasets and using diverse feature extraction backbones highlight the benefits of similarity matching in the dissimilarity space. In particular, when jointly training the feature extraction backbone and regularised classifier for matching, the dissimilarity space provides a higher level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Vision: Training Vision-Language Models to Understand Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reasoning, which involves the interpretation, understanding, and prediction of object behavior in dynamic environments, remains a significant challenge for current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.</description>

      <title>EOV-Seg: Efficient Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation aims to segment and classify everything in diverse scenes across an unbounded vocabulary. Existing methods typically employ two-stage or single-stage framework. The two-stage framework involves cropping the image multiple times using masks generated by a mask generator, followed by feature extraction, while the single-stage framework relies on a heavyweight mask decoder to make up for the lack of spatial position information through self-attention and cross-attention in multiple stacked Transformer blocks. Both methods incur substantial computational overhead, thereby hindering the efficiency of model inference. To fill the gap in efficiency, we propose EOV-Seg, a novel single-stage, shared, efficient, and spatial-aware framework designed for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Specifically, EOV-Seg innovates in two aspects. First, a Vocabulary-Aware Selection (VAS) module is proposed to improve the semantic comprehension of visual aggregated features and alleviate the feature interaction burden on the mask decoder. Second, we introduce a Two-way Dynamic Embedding Experts (TDEE), which efficiently utilizes the spatial awareness capabilities of ViT-based CLIP backbone. To the best of our knowledge, EOV-Seg is the first open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation framework towards efficiency, which runs faster and achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, with COCO training only, EOV-Seg achieves 24.2 PQ, 31.6 mIoU, and 12.7 FPS on the ADE20K dataset for panoptic and semantic segmentation tasks and the inference time of EOV-Seg is 4-21 times faster than state-of-the-art methods. Especially, equipped with ResNet-50 backbone, EOV-Seg runs 25 FPS with only 71M parameters on a single RTX 3090 GPU. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/nhw649/EOV-Seg}.</description>

      <title>FlowEdit: Inversion-Free Text-Based Editing Using Pre-Trained Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map. However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions (corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.</description>

      <title>DMin: Scalable Training Data Influence Estimation for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models, yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. As diffusion models scale up, these methods become impractical. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. By leveraging efficient gradient compression and retrieval techniques, DMin reduces storage requirements from 339.39 TB to only 726 MB and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</description>

      <title>BLADE: Single-view Body Mesh Learning through Accurate Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-image human mesh recovery is a challenging task due to the ill-posed nature of simultaneous body shape, pose, and camera estimation. Existing estimators work well on images taken from afar, but they break down as the person moves close to the camera. Moreover, current methods fail to achieve both accurate 3D pose and 2D alignment at the same time. Error is mainly introduced by inaccurate perspective projection heuristically derived from orthographic parameters. To resolve this long-standing challenge, we present our method BLADE which accurately recovers perspective parameters from a single image without heuristic assumptions. We start from the inverse relationship between perspective distortion and the person's Z-translation Tz, and we show that Tz can be reliably estimated from the image. We then discuss the important role of Tz for accurate human mesh recovery estimated from close-range images. Finally, we show that, once Tz and the 3D human mesh are estimated, one can accurately recover the focal length and full 3D translation. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world close-range images show that our method is the first to accurately recover projection parameters from a single image, and consequently attain state-of-the-art accuracy on 3D pose estimation and 2D alignment for a wide range of images. https://research.nvidia.com/labs/amri/projects/blade/</description>

      <title>3D Mesh Editing using Masked LRMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to mesh shape editing, building on recent progress in 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. We formulate shape editing as a conditional reconstruction problem, where the model must reconstruct the input shape with the exception of a specified 3D region, in which the geometry should be generated from the conditional signal. To this end, we train a conditional Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for masked reconstruction, using multi-view consistent masks rendered from a randomly generated 3D occlusion, and using one clean viewpoint as the conditional signal. During inference, we manually define a 3D region to edit and provide an edited image from a canonical viewpoint to fill in that region. We demonstrate that, in just a single forward pass, our method not only preserves the input geometry in the unmasked region through reconstruction capabilities on par with SoTA, but is also expressive enough to perform a variety of mesh edits from a single image guidance that past works struggle with, while being 10x faster than the top-performing competing prior work.</description>

      <title>GPD-1: Generative Pre-training for Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the evolutions of driving scenarios is important for the evaluation and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. Most existing methods focus on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions. For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop simulation, map prediction, and motion planning.

      <title>ObjectMate: A Recurrence Prior for Object Insertion and Subject-Driven Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a tuning-free method for both object insertion and subject-driven generation. The task involves composing an object, given multiple views, into a scene specified by either an image or text. Existing methods struggle to fully meet the task's challenging objectives: (i) seamlessly composing the object into the scene with photorealistic pose and lighting, and (ii) preserving the object's identity. We hypothesize that achieving these goals requires large scale supervision, but manually collecting sufficient data is simply too expensive. The key observation in this paper is that many mass-produced objects recur across multiple images of large unlabeled datasets, in different scenes, poses, and lighting conditions. We use this observation to create massive supervision by retrieving sets of diverse views of the same object. This powerful paired dataset enables us to train a straightforward text-to-image diffusion architecture to map the object and scene descriptions to the composited image. We compare our method, ObjectMate, with state-of-the-art methods for object insertion and subject-driven generation, using a single or multiple references. Empirically, ObjectMate achieves superior identity preservation and more photorealistic composition. Differently from many other multi-reference methods, ObjectMate does not require slow test-time tuning.</description>

      <title>StreamChat: Chatting with Streaming Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents StreamChat, a novel approach that enhances the interaction capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with streaming video content. In streaming interaction scenarios, existing methods rely solely on visual information available at the moment a question is posed, resulting in significant delays as the model remains unaware of subsequent changes in the streaming video. StreamChat addresses this limitation by innovatively updating the visual context at each decoding step, ensuring that the model utilizes up-to-date video content throughout the decoding process. Additionally, we introduce a flexible and efficient crossattention-based architecture to process dynamic streaming inputs while maintaining inference efficiency for streaming interactions. Furthermore, we construct a new dense instruction dataset to facilitate the training of streaming interaction models, complemented by a parallel 3D-RoPE mechanism that encodes the relative temporal information of visual and text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamChat achieves competitive performance on established image and video benchmarks and exhibits superior capabilities in streaming interaction scenarios compared to state-of-the-art video LMM.</description>

      <title>SegFace: Face Segmentation of Long-Tail Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face parsing refers to the semantic segmentation of human faces into key facial regions such as eyes, nose, hair, etc. It serves as a prerequisite for various advanced applications, including face editing, face swapping, and facial makeup, which often require segmentation masks for classes like eyeglasses, hats, earrings, and necklaces. These infrequently occurring classes are called long-tail classes, which are overshadowed by more frequently occurring classes known as head classes. Existing methods, primarily CNN-based, tend to be dominated by head classes during training, resulting in suboptimal representation for long-tail classes. Previous works have largely overlooked the problem of poor segmentation performance of long-tail classes. To address this issue, we propose SegFace, a simple and efficient approach that uses a lightweight transformer-based model which utilizes learnable class-specific tokens. The transformer decoder leverages class-specific tokens, allowing each token to focus on its corresponding class, thereby enabling independent modeling of each class. The proposed approach improves the performance of long-tail classes, thereby boosting overall performance. To the best of our knowledge, SegFace is the first work to employ transformer models for face parsing. Moreover, our approach can be adapted for low-compute edge devices, achieving 95.96 FPS. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that SegFace significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean F1 score of 88.96 (+2.82) on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset and 93.03 (+0.65) on the LaPa dataset.

      <title>Swin fMRI Transformer Predicts Early Neurodevelopmental Outcomes from Neonatal fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain development in the first few months of human life is a critical phase characterized by rapid structural growth and functional organization. Accurately predicting developmental outcomes during this time is crucial for identifying delays and enabling timely interventions. This study introduces the SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer) model, designed to predict Bayley-III composite scores using neonatal fMRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). To enhance predictive accuracy, we apply dimensionality reduction via group independent component analysis (ICA) and pretrain SwiFT on large adult fMRI datasets to address the challenges of limited neonatal data. Our analysis shows that SwiFT significantly outperforms baseline models in predicting cognitive, motor, and language outcomes, leveraging both single-label and multi-label prediction strategies. The model's attention-based architecture processes spatiotemporal data end-to-end, delivering superior predictive performance. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradients with Smoothgrad sQuare (IG-SQ) to interpret predictions, identifying neural spatial representations linked to early cognitive and behavioral development. These findings underscore the potential of Transformer models to advance neurodevelopmental research and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>XLSTM-HVED: Cross-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation and MRI Reconstruction Method Using Vision XLSTM and Heteromodal Variational Encoder-Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurogliomas are among the most aggressive forms of cancer, presenting considerable challenges in both treatment and monitoring due to their unpredictable biological behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring gliomas. However, the lack of specific imaging techniques often compromises the accuracy of tumor segmentation during the imaging process. To address this issue, we introduce the XLSTM-HVED model. This model integrates a hetero-modal encoder-decoder framework with the Vision XLSTM module to reconstruct missing MRI modalities. By deeply fusing spatial and temporal features, it enhances tumor segmentation performance. The key innovation of our approach is the Self-Attention Variational Encoder (SAVE) module, which improves the integration of modal features. Additionally, it optimizes the interaction of features between segmentation and reconstruction tasks through the Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation Cross Awareness (SFECA) module. Our experiments using the BraTS 2024 dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing advanced methods in handling cases where modalities are missing.

      <title>Diagnosis and Severity Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis using Self Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an incurable inflammatory bowel disease that leads to ulcers along the large intestine and rectum. The increase in the prevalence of UC coupled with gastrointestinal physician shortages stresses the healthcare system and limits the care UC patients receive. A colonoscopy is performed to diagnose UC and assess its severity based on the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES). The MES ranges between zero and three, wherein zero indicates no inflammation and three indicates that the inflammation is markedly high. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based neural network models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are capable of analyzing colonoscopies to diagnose and determine the severity of UC by modeling colonoscopy analysis as a multi-class classification problem. Prior research for AI-based UC diagnosis relies on supervised learning approaches that require large annotated datasets to train the CNNs. However, creating such datasets necessitates that domain experts invest a significant amount of time, rendering the process expensive and challenging. To address the challenge, this research employs self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that can efficiently train on unannotated datasets to analyze colonoscopies and, aid in diagnosing UC and its severity. A comparative analysis with supervised learning models shows that SSL frameworks, such as SwAV and SparK outperform supervised learning models on the LIMUC dataset, the largest publicly available annotated dataset of colonoscopy images for UC.</description>

      <title>Graph convolutional networks enable fast hemorrhagic stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To develop a fast image reconstruction method for stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography with image quality comparable to computationally expensive nonlinear model-based methods. Methods: A post-processing approach with graph convolutional networks is employed. Utilizing the flexibility of the graph setting, a graph U-net is trained on linear difference reconstructions from 2D simulated stroke data and applied to fully 3D images from realistic simulated and experimental data. An additional network, trained on 3D vs. 2D images, is also considered for comparison. Results: Post-processing the linear difference reconstructions through the graph U-net significantly improved the image quality, resulting in images comparable to, or better than, the time-intensive nonlinear reconstruction method (a few minutes vs. several hours). Conclusion: Pairing a fast reconstruction method, such as linear difference imaging, with post-processing through a graph U-net provided significant improvements, at a negligible computational cost. Training in the graph framework vs classic pixel-based setting (CNN) allowed the ability to train on 2D cross-sectional images and process 3D volumes providing a nearly 50x savings in data simulation costs with no noticeable loss in quality. Significance: The proposed approach of post-processing a linear difference reconstruction with the graph U-net could be a feasible approach for on-line monitoring of hemorrhagic stroke.</description>

      <title>Explaining and Mitigating the Modality Gap in Contrastive Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has recently gained significant popularity, demonstrating impressive performance across various zero-shot classification tasks and a range of perceptive and generative applications. Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) are designed to bridge different modalities, such as images and text, by learning a shared representation space through contrastive learning. Despite their success, the working mechanisms underlying multimodal learning are not yet well understood. Notably, these models often exhibit a modality gap, where different modalities occupy distinct regions within the shared representation space. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the emergence of modality gap by characterizing the gradient flow learning dynamics. Specifically, we identify the critical roles of mismatched data pairs and a learnable temperature parameter in causing and perpetuating the modality gap during training. Furthermore, our theoretical insights are validated through experiments on practical CLIP models. These findings provide principled guidance for mitigating the modality gap, including strategies such as appropriate temperature scheduling and modality swapping. Additionally, we demonstrate that closing the modality gap leads to improved performance on tasks such as image-text retrieval.</description>

      <title>AmCLR: Unified Augmented Learning for Cross-Modal Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a pivotal framework for representation learning, underpinning advances in both unimodal and bimodal applications like SimCLR and CLIP. To address fundamental limitations like large batch size dependency and bimodality, methods such as SogCLR leverage stochastic optimization for the global contrastive objective. Inspired by SogCLR's efficiency and adaptability, we introduce AmCLR and xAmCLR objective functions tailored for bimodal vision-language models to further enhance the robustness of contrastive learning. AmCLR integrates diverse augmentations, including text paraphrasing and image transformations, to reinforce the alignment of contrastive representations, keeping batch size limited to a few hundred samples unlike CLIP which needs batch size of 32,768 to produce reasonable results. xAmCLR further extends this paradigm by incorporating intra-modal alignments between original and augmented modalities for richer feature learning. These advancements yield a more resilient and generalizable contrastive learning process, aimed at overcoming bottlenecks in scaling and augmentative diversity. Since we have built our framework on the existing SogCLR, we are able to demonstrate improved representation quality with fewer computational resources, establishing a foundation for scalable and robust multi-modal learning.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Control of Robotic X-ray Devices using a Language-promptable Digital Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language offers a convenient, flexible interface for controlling robotic C-arm X-ray systems, making advanced functionality and controls accessible. However, enabling language interfaces requires specialized AI models that interpret X-ray images to create a semantic representation for reasoning. The fixed outputs of such AI models limit the functionality of language controls. Incorporating flexible, language-aligned AI models prompted through language enables more versatile interfaces for diverse tasks and procedures. Using a language-aligned foundation model for X-ray image segmentation, our system continually updates a patient digital twin based on sparse reconstructions of desired anatomical structures. This supports autonomous capabilities such as visualization, patient-specific viewfinding, and automatic collimation from novel viewpoints, enabling commands 'Focus in on the lower lumbar vertebrae.' In a cadaver study, users visualized, localized, and collimated structures across the torso using verbal commands, achieving 84% end-to-end success. Post hoc analysis of randomly oriented images showed our patient digital twin could localize 35 commonly requested structures to within 51.68 mm, enabling localization and isolation from arbitrary orientations. Our results demonstrate how intelligent robotic X-ray systems can incorporate physicians' expressed intent directly. While existing foundation models for intra-operative X-ray analysis exhibit failure modes, as they improve, they can facilitate highly flexible, intelligent robotic C-arms.</description>

      <title>BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>DOGE: An Extrinsic Orientation and Gyroscope Bias Estimation for Visual-Inertial Odometry Initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) initialization methods rely on accurate pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters. However, during long-term use, irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.</description>

      <title>ProGDF: Progressive Gaussian Differential Field for Controllable and Flexible 3D Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D editing plays a crucial role in editing and reusing existing 3D assets, thereby enhancing productivity. Recently, 3DGS-based methods have gained increasing attention due to their efficient rendering and flexibility. However, achieving desired 3D editing results often requires multiple adjustments in an iterative loop, resulting in tens of minutes of training time cost for each attempt and a cumbersome trial-and-error cycle for users. This in-the-loop training paradigm results in a poor user experience. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of process-oriented modelling for 3D editing and propose the Progressive Gaussian Differential Field (ProGDF), an out-of-loop training approach that requires only a single training session to provide users with controllable editing capability and variable editing results through a user-friendly interface in real-time. ProGDF consists of two key components: Progressive Gaussian Splatting (PGS) and Gaussian Differential Field (GDF). PGS introduces the progressive constraint to extract the diverse intermediate results of the editing process and employs rendering quality regularization to improve the quality of these results. Based on these intermediate results, GDF leverages a lightweight neural network to model the editing process. Extensive results on two novel applications, namely controllable 3D editing and flexible fine-grained 3D manipulation, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and flexibility of the proposed ProGDF.</description>

Abstract: Due to the remarkable generative potential of diffusion-based models, numerous researches have investigated jailbreak attacks targeting these frameworks. A particularly concerning threat within image models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content. Despite the implementation of security filters, numerous efforts continue to explore ways to circumvent these safeguards. Current attack methodologies primarily encompass adversarial prompt engineering or concept obfuscation, yet they frequently suffer from slow search efficiency, conspicuous attack characteristics and poor alignment with targets. To overcome these challenges, we propose Antelope, a more robust and covert jailbreak attack strategy designed to expose security vulnerabilities inherent in generative models. Specifically, Antelope leverages the confusion of sensitive concepts with similar ones, facilitates searches in the semantically adjacent space of these related concepts and aligns them with the target imagery, thereby generating sensitive images that are consistent with the target and capable of evading detection. Besides, we successfully exploit the transferability of model-based attacks to penetrate online black-box services. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Antelope outperforms existing baselines across multiple defensive mechanisms, underscoring its efficacy and versatility.</description>

      <title>Textured Mesh Saliency: Bridging Geometry and Texture for Human Perception in 3D Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textured meshes significantly enhance the realism and detail of objects by mapping intricate texture details onto the geometric structure of 3D models. This advancement is valuable across various applications, including entertainment, education, and industry. While traditional mesh saliency studies focus on non-textured meshes, our work explores the complexities introduced by detailed texture patterns. We present a new dataset for textured mesh saliency, created through an innovative eye-tracking experiment in a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) VR environment. This dataset addresses the limitations of previous studies by providing comprehensive eye-tracking data from multiple viewpoints, thereby advancing our understanding of human visual behavior and supporting more accurate and effective 3D content creation. Our proposed model predicts saliency maps for textured mesh surfaces by treating each triangular face as an individual unit and assigning a saliency density value to reflect the importance of each local surface region. The model incorporates a texture alignment module and a geometric extraction module, combined with an aggregation module to integrate texture and geometry for precise saliency prediction. We believe this approach will enhance the visual fidelity of geometric processing algorithms while ensuring efficient use of computational resources, which is crucial for real-time rendering and high-detail applications such as VR and gaming.</description>

      <title>Semantic Scene Completion Based 3D Traversability Estimation for Off-Road Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-road environments present significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles due to the absence of structured roads and the presence of complex obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional perception algorithms, designed primarily for structured environments, often fail under these conditions, leading to inaccurate traversability estimations. In this paper, ORDformer, a novel multimodal method that combines LiDAR point clouds with monocular images, is proposed to generate dense traversable occupancy predictions from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is enhanced, which is crucial for accurate occupancy estimation in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC, a dataset with 3D traversable occupancy annotations, is introduced, incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness. Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obstacle-crossing conditions and the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free. Experimental results demonstrate that ORDformer outperforms existing approaches in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, ORDformer achieves over a 20\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms, allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.</description>

      <title>DocSum: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training for Document Abstractive Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstractive summarization has made significant strides in condensing and rephrasing large volumes of text into coherent summaries. However, summarizing administrative documents presents unique challenges due to domain-specific terminology, OCR-generated errors, and the scarcity of annotated datasets for model fine-tuning. Existing models often struggle to adapt to the intricate structure and specialized content of such documents. To address these limitations, we introduce DocSum, a domain-adaptive abstractive summarization framework tailored for administrative documents. Leveraging pre-training on OCR-transcribed text and fine-tuning with an innovative integration of question-answer pairs, DocSum enhances summary accuracy and relevance. This approach tackles the complexities inherent in administrative content, ensuring outputs that align with real-world business needs. To evaluate its capabilities, we define a novel downstream task setting-Document Abstractive Summarization-which reflects the practical requirements of business and organizational settings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DocSum's effectiveness in producing high-quality summaries, showcasing its potential to improve decision-making and operational workflows across the public and private sectors.</description>

      <title>Unified HT-CNNs Architecture: Transfer Learning for Segmenting Diverse Brain Tumors in MRI from Gliomas to Pediatric Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from 3D multimodal MRI is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning across diverse brain tumors. This paper addresses the challenges posed by the BraTS 2023, presenting a unified transfer learning approach that applies to a broader spectrum of brain tumors. We introduce HT-CNNs, an ensemble of Hybrid Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks optimized through transfer learning for varied brain tumor segmentation. This method captures spatial and contextual details from MRI data, fine-tuned on diverse datasets representing common tumor types. Through transfer learning, HT-CNNs utilize the learned representations from one task to improve generalization in another, harnessing the power of pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tuning them on specific tumor types. We preprocess diverse datasets from multiple international distributions, ensuring representativeness for the most common brain tumors. Our rigorous evaluation employs standardized quantitative metrics across all tumor types, ensuring robustness and generalizability. The proposed ensemble model achieves superior segmentation results across the BraTS validation datasets over the previous winning methods. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations using the DSC and HD95 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Qualitative segmentation predictions further validate the high-quality outputs produced by our model. Our findings underscore the potential of transfer learning and ensemble approaches in medical image segmentation, indicating a substantial enhancement in clinical decision-making and patient care. Despite facing challenges related to post-processing and domain gaps, our study sets a new precedent for future research for brain tumor segmentation.

      <title>Adversarial Contrastive Domain-Generative Learning for Bacteria Raman Spectrum Joint Denoising and Cross-Domain Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy, as a label-free detection technology, has been widely utilized in the clinical diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria. However, Raman signals are naturally weak and sensitive to the condition of the acquisition process. The characteristic spectra of a bacteria can manifest varying signal-to-noise ratios and domain discrepancies under different acquisition conditions. Consequently, existing methods often face challenges when making identification for unobserved acquisition conditions, i.e., the testing acquisition conditions are unavailable during model training. In this article, a generic framework, namely, an adversarial contrastive domain-generative learning framework, is proposed for joint Raman spectroscopy denoising and cross-domain identification. The proposed method is composed of a domain generation module and a domain task module. Through adversarial learning between these two modules, it utilizes only a single available source domain spectral data to generate extended denoised domains that are semantically consistent with the source domain and extracts domain-invariant representations. Comprehensive case studies indicate that the proposed method can simultaneously conduct spectral denoising without necessitating noise-free ground-truth and can achieve improved diagnostic accuracy and robustness under cross-domain unseen spectral acquisition conditions. This suggests that the proposed method holds remarkable potential as a diagnostic tool in real clinical cases.</description>

      <title>MoMuSE: Momentum Multi-modal Target Speaker Extraction for Real-time Scenarios with Impaired Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture using time-synchronized visual cues. In real-world scenarios, visual cues are not always available due to various impairments, which undermines the stability of AV-TSE. Despite this challenge, humans can maintain attentional momentum over time, even when the target speaker is not visible. In this paper, we introduce the Momentum Multi-modal target Speaker Extraction (MoMuSE), which retains a speaker identity momentum in memory, enabling the model to continuously track the target speaker. Designed for real-time inference, MoMuSE extracts the current speech window with guidance from both visual cues and dynamically updated speaker momentum. Experimental results demonstrate that MoMuSE exhibits significant improvement, particularly in scenarios with severe impairment of visual cues.</description>

      <title>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</description>

      <title>ConDSeg: A General Medical Image Segmentation Framework via Contrast-Driven Feature Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in clinical decision making, treatment planning, and disease tracking. However, it still faces two major challenges. On the one hand, there is often a ``soft boundary'' between foreground and background in medical images, with poor illumination and low contrast further reducing the distinguishability of foreground and background within the image. On the other hand, co-occurrence phenomena are widespread in medical images, and learning these features is misleading to the model's judgment. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework called Contrast-Driven Medical Image Segmentation (ConDSeg). First, we develop a contrastive training strategy called Consistency Reinforcement. It is designed to improve the encoder's robustness in various illumination and contrast scenarios, enabling the model to extract high-quality features even in adverse environments. Second, we introduce a Semantic Information Decoupling module, which is able to decouple features from the encoder into foreground, background, and uncertainty regions, gradually acquiring the ability to reduce uncertainty during training. The Contrast-Driven Feature Aggregation module then contrasts the foreground and background features to guide multi-level feature fusion and key feature enhancement, further distinguishing the entities to be segmented. We also propose a Size-Aware Decoder to solve the scale singularity of the decoder. It accurately locate entities of different sizes in the image, thus avoiding erroneous learning of co-occurrence features. Extensive experiments on five medical image datasets across three scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, proving its advanced nature and general applicability to various medical image segmentation scenarios. Our released code is available at \url{https://github.com/Mengqi-Lei/ConDSeg}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic method in various fields, and recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in CT image reconstruction. However, the lack of large-scale, open-access datasets has hindered the comparison of different types of learned methods. To address this gap, we use the 2DeteCT dataset, a real-world experimental computed tomography dataset, for benchmarking machine learning based CT image reconstruction algorithms. We categorize these methods into post-processing networks, learned/unrolled iterative methods, learned regularizer methods, and plug-and-play methods, and provide a pipeline for easy implementation and evaluation. Using key performance metrics, including SSIM and PSNR, our benchmarking results showcase the effectiveness of various algorithms on tasks such as full data reconstruction, limited-angle reconstruction, sparse-angle reconstruction, low-dose reconstruction, and beam-hardening corrected reconstruction. With this benchmarking study, we provide an evaluation of a range of algorithms representative for different categories of learned reconstruction methods on a recently published dataset of real-world experimental CT measurements. The reproducible setup of methods and CT image reconstruction tasks in an open-source toolbox enables straightforward addition and comparison of new methods later on. The toolbox also provides the option to load the 2DeteCT dataset differently for extensions to other problems and different CT reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on natural language instructions. Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multi-hand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework. It leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens which are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods on Multi-GraspSet. More information can be found on our project page https://multi-graspllm.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh generation has become a critical topic in recent years, forming the foundation of all 3D objects used across various applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and 3D printing. With advancements in computational resources and machine learning, neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality 3D object representations, enabling accurate scene and object reconstructions. Despite these advancements, many methods produce meshes that lack realism or exhibit geometric and textural flaws, necessitating additional processing to improve their quality. This research introduces a convex optimization programming called disciplined convex programming to enhance existing meshes by refining their texture and geometry with a conic solver. By focusing on a sparse set of point clouds from both the original and target meshes, this method demonstrates significant improvements in mesh quality with minimal data requirements. To evaluate the approach, the classical dolphin mesh dataset from Facebook AI was used as a case study, with optimization performed using the CVXPY library. The results reveal promising potential for streamlined and effective mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence based chromospheric feature extractor and classifier for SUIT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sewing patterns, the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring, act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach Design2GarmentCode based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility. Our code and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Latent Language Modeling with Next-Token Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). In this work, we propose Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings. The codebase is provided to facilitate further research: https://github.com/tiktok/fast_prompt_alignment</description>

      <title>Diverse Similarity Encoder for Deep GAN Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.10201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) can synthesize high-quality (HQ) images, so learning representation with GANs is favorable. GAN inversion is one of emerging approaches that study how to invert images into latent space. Existing GAN encoders can invert images on StyleGAN, but cannot adapt to other deep GANs. We propose a novel approach to address this issue. By evaluating diverse similarity in latent vectors and images, we design an adaptive encoder, named diverse similarity encoder (DSE), that can be expanded to a variety of state-of-the-art GANs. DSE makes GANs reconstruct higher fidelity images from HQ images, no matter whether they are synthesized or real images. DSE has unified convolutional blocks and adapts well to mainstream deep GANs, e.g., PGGAN, StyleGAN, and BigGAN.</description>

      <title>TRIGS: Trojan Identification from Gradient-based Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training machine learning models can be very expensive or even unaffordable. This may be, for example, due to data limitations, such as unavailability or being too large, or computational power limitations. Therefore, it is a common practice to rely on open-source pre-trained models whenever possible.However, this practice is alarming from a security perspective. Pre-trained models can be infected with Trojan attacks, in which the attacker embeds a trigger in the model such that the model's behavior can be controlled by the attacker when the trigger is present in the input. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting Trojan models. Our method creates a signature for a model based on activation optimization. A classifier is then trained to detect a Trojan model given its signature. We call our method TRIGS for TRojan Identification from Gradient-based Signatures. TRIGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets of convolutional models. Additionally, we introduce a new challenging dataset of ImageNet models based on the vision transformer architecture. TRIGS delivers the best performance on the new dataset, surpassing the baseline methods by a large margin. Our experiments also show that TRIGS requires only a small amount of clean samples to achieve good performance, and works reasonably well even if the defender does not have prior knowledge about the attacker's model architecture. Our code and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Counting Guidance for High Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there have been significant improvements in the quality and performance of text-to-image generation, largely due to the impressive results attained by diffusion models. However, text-to-image diffusion models sometimes struggle to create high-fidelity content for the given input prompt. One specific issue is their difficulty in generating the precise number of objects specified in the text prompt. For example, when provided with the prompt "five apples and ten lemons on a table," images generated by diffusion models often contain an incorrect number of objects. In this paper, we present a method to improve diffusion models so that they accurately produce the correct object count based on the input prompt. We adopt a counting network that performs reference-less class-agnostic counting for any given image. We calculate the gradients of the counting network and refine the predicted noise for each step. To address the presence of multiple types of objects in the prompt, we utilize novel attention map guidance to obtain high-quality masks for each object. Finally, we guide the denoising process using the calculated gradients for each object. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the fidelity of diffusion models with respect to object count.</description>

      <title>Learning Photometric Feature Transform for Free-form Object Scan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework to automatically learn to aggregate and transform photometric measurements from multiple unstructured views into spatially distinctive and view-invariant low-level features, which are subsequently fed to a multi-view stereo pipeline to enhance 3D reconstruction. The illumination conditions during acquisition and the feature transform are jointly trained on a large amount of synthetic data. We further build a system to reconstruct both the geometry and anisotropic reflectance of a variety of challenging objects from hand-held scans. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated with a lightweight prototype, consisting of a camera and an array of LEDs, as well as an off-the-shelf tablet. Our results are validated against reconstructions from a professional 3D scanner and photographs, and compare favorably with state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Woodpecker: Hallucination Correction for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucination is a big shadow hanging over the rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), referring to the phenomenon that the generated text is inconsistent with the image content. In order to mitigate hallucinations, existing studies mainly resort to an instruction-tuning manner that requires retraining the models with specific data. In this paper, we pave a different way, introducing a training-free method named Woodpecker. Like a woodpecker heals trees, it picks out and corrects hallucinations from the generated text. Concretely, Woodpecker consists of five stages: key concept extraction, question formulation, visual knowledge validation, visual claim generation, and hallucination correction. Implemented in a post-remedy manner, Woodpecker can easily serve different MLLMs, while being interpretable by accessing intermediate outputs of the five stages. We evaluate Woodpecker both quantitatively and qualitatively and show the huge potential of this new paradigm. On the POPE benchmark, our method obtains a 30.66%/24.33% improvement in accuracy over the baseline MiniGPT-4/mPLUG-Owl.

      <title>Strong but simple: A Baseline for Domain Generalized Dense Perception by CLIP-based Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNNs), where domain shifts occur due to synthetic data, lighting, weather, or location changes. Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Image Inpainting via Tractable Steering of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the current state of the art for generating photorealistic images. Controlling the sampling process for constrained image generation tasks such as inpainting, however, remains challenging since exact conditioning on such constraints is intractable. While existing methods use various techniques to approximate the constrained posterior, this paper proposes to exploit the ability of Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to exactly and efficiently compute the constrained posterior, and to leverage this signal to steer the denoising process of diffusion models. Specifically, this paper adopts a class of expressive TPMs termed Probabilistic Circuits (PCs). Building upon prior advances, we further scale up PCs and make them capable of guiding the image generation process of diffusion models. Empirical results suggest that our approach can consistently improve the overall quality and semantic coherence of inpainted images across three natural image datasets (i.e., CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and LSUN) with only $\sim\! 10 \%$ additional computational overhead brought by the TPM. Further, with the help of an image encoder and decoder, our method can readily accept semantic constraints on specific regions of the image, which opens up the potential for more controlled image generation tasks. In addition to proposing a new framework for constrained image generation, this paper highlights the benefit of more tractable models and motivates the development of expressive TPMs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Face Liveness Detection via De-fake Face Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) methods face the challenge of generalizing to unseen domains, mainly because most existing FAS datasets are relatively small and lack data diversity. Thanks to the development of face recognition in the past decade, numerous real face images are available publicly, which are however neglected previously by the existing literature. In this paper, we propose an Anomalous cue Guided FAS (AG-FAS) method, which can effectively leverage large-scale additional real faces for improving model generalization via a De-fake Face Generator (DFG). Specifically, by training on a large-scale real face only dataset, the generator obtains the knowledge of what a real face should be like, and thus has the capability of generating a "real" version of any input face image. Consequently, the difference between the input face and the generated "real" face can be treated as cues of attention for the fake feature learning. With the above ideas, an Off-real Attention Network (OA-Net) is proposed which allocates its attention to the spoof region of the input according to the anomalous cue. Extensive experiments on a total of nine public datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art results under cross-domain evaluations with unseen scenarios and unknown presentation attacks. Besides, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed anomalous cues.</description>

Abstract: Filter-decomposition-based group equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising stability and data efficiency for 3D image feature extraction. However, these networks, which rely on parameter sharing and discrete transformation groups, often underperform in modern deep neural network architectures for processing volumetric images, such as the common 3D medical images. To address these limitations, this paper presents an efficient non-parameter-sharing continuous 3D affine group equivariant neural network for volumetric images. This network uses an adaptive aggregation of Monte Carlo augmented spherical Fourier-Bessel filter bases to improve the efficiency and flexibility of 3D group equivariant CNNs for volumetric data. Unlike existing methods that focus only on angular orthogonality in filter bases, the introduced spherical Bessel Fourier filter base incorporates both angular and radial orthogonality to improve feature extraction. Experiments on four medical image segmentation datasets show that the proposed methods achieve better affine group equivariance and superior segmentation accuracy than existing 3D group equivariant convolutional neural network layers, significantly improving the training stability and data efficiency of conventional CNN layers (at 0.05 significance level).

Abstract: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, for biometric tasks. We specifically examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in performing biometric-related tasks, with an emphasis on face recognition, gender detection, and age estimation. Since biometrics are considered as sensitive information, ChatGPT avoids answering direct prompts, and thus we crafted a prompting strategy to bypass its safeguard and evaluate the capabilities for biometrics tasks. Our study reveals that ChatGPT recognizes facial identities and differentiates between two facial images with considerable accuracy. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in gender detection and reasonable accuracy for the age estimation tasks. Our findings shed light on the promising potentials in the application of LLMs and foundation models for biometrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-principle single-object model is proposed for pedestrian tracking. It is assumed that the extent of the moving object can be described via known statistics in 3D, such as pedestrian height. The proposed model thus need not constrain the object motion in 3D to a common ground plane, which is usual in 3D visual tracking applications. A nonlinear filter for this model is implemented using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and tested using the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. The proposed solution yields promising results in 3D while maintaining perfect results when projected into the 2D image. Moreover, the estimation error covariance matches the true one. Unlike conventional methods, the introduced model parameters have convenient meaning and can readily be adjusted for a problem.</description>

      <title>Just Shift It: Test-Time Prototype Shifting for Zero-Shot Generalization with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Mirror-3DGS: Incorporating Mirror Reflections into 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3DGS struggles with accurately modeling physical reflections, particularly in mirrors, leading to incorrect reconstructions and inconsistent reflective properties. To address this challenge, we introduce Mirror-3DGS, a novel framework designed to accurately handle mirror geometries and reflections, thereby generating realistic mirror reflections. By incorporating mirror attributes into 3DGS and leveraging plane mirror imaging principles, Mirror-3DGS simulates a mirrored viewpoint from behind the mirror, enhancing the realism of scene renderings. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that our method can render novel views with improved fidelity in real-time, surpassing the state-of-the-art Mirror-NeRF, especially in mirror regions.</description>

      <title>MonoBox: Tightness-free Box-supervised Polyp Segmentation using Monotonicity Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01188v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose MonoBox, an innovative box-supervised segmentation method constrained by monotonicity to liberate its training from the user-unfriendly box-tightness assumption. In contrast to conventional box-supervised segmentation, where the box edges must precisely touch the target boundaries, MonoBox leverages imprecisely-annotated boxes to achieve robust pixel-wise segmentation. The 'linchpin' is that, within the noisy zones around box edges, MonoBox discards the traditional misguiding multiple-instance learning loss, and instead optimizes a carefully-designed objective, termed monotonicity constraint. Along directions transitioning from the foreground to background, this new constraint steers responses to adhere to a trend of monotonically decreasing values. Consequently, the originally unreliable learning within the noisy zones is transformed into a correct and effective monotonicity optimization. Moreover, an adaptive label correction is introduced, enabling MonoBox to enhance the tightness of box annotations using predicted masks from the previous epoch and dynamically shrink the noisy zones as training progresses. We verify MonoBox in the box-supervised segmentation task of polyps, where satisfying box-tightness is challenging due to the vague boundaries between the polyp and normal tissues. Experiments on both public synthetic and in-house real noisy datasets demonstrate that MonoBox exceeds other anti-noise state-of-the-arts by improving Dice by at least 5.5% and 3.3%, respectively. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/MonoBox.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Synthesized Underwater Image Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the physics-inspired synthesized underwater image dataset (PHISWID), a dataset tailored for enhancing underwater image processing through physics-inspired image synthesis. For underwater image enhancement, data-driven approaches (e.g., deep neural networks) typically demand extensive datasets, yet acquiring paired clean and degraded underwater images poses significant challenges. Existing datasets have limited contributions to image enhancement due to lack of physics models, publicity, and ground-truth images. PHISWID addresses these issues by offering a set of paired ground-truth (atmospheric) and underwater images synthetically degraded by color degradation and marine snow artifacts. Generating underwater images from atmospheric RGB-D images based on physical models provides pairs of real-world ground-truth and degraded images. Our synthetic approach generates a large quantity of the pairs, enabling effective training of deep neural networks and objective image quality assessment. Through benchmark experiment with some datasets and image enhance methods, we validate that our dataset can improve the image enhancement performance. Our dataset, which is publicly available, contributes to the development in underwater image processing.</description>

      <title>FastFace: Fast-converging Scheduler for Large-scale Face Recognition Training with One GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing power has evolved into a foundational and indispensable resource in the area of deep learning, particularly in tasks such as Face Recognition (FR) model training on large-scale datasets, where multiple GPUs are often a necessity. Recognizing this challenge, some FR methods have started exploring ways to compress the fully-connected layer in FR models. Unlike other approaches, our observations reveal that without prompt scheduling of the learning rate (LR) during FR model training, the loss curve tends to exhibit numerous stationary subsequences. To address this issue, we introduce a novel LR scheduler leveraging Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Haar Convolutional Kernel (HCK) to eliminate stationary subsequences, resulting in a significant reduction in converging time. However, the proposed scheduler incurs a considerable computational overhead due to its time complexity. To overcome this limitation, we propose FastFace, a fast-converging scheduler with negligible time complexity, i.e. O(1) per iteration, during training. In practice, FastFace is able to accelerate FR model training to a quarter of its original time without sacrificing more than 1% accuracy, making large-scale FR training feasible even with just one single GPU in terms of both time and space complexity. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of FastFace. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/amoonfana/FastFace</description>

      <title>AniClipart: Clipart Animation with Text-to-Video Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clipart, a pre-made art form, offers a convenient and efficient way of creating visual content. However, traditional workflows for animating static clipart are laborious and time-consuming, involving steps like rigging, keyframing, and inbetweening. Recent advancements in text-to-video generation hold great potential in resolving this challenge. Nevertheless, direct application of text-to-video models often struggles to preserve the visual identity of clipart or generate cartoon-style motion, resulting in subpar animation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce AniClipart, a computational system that converts static clipart into high-quality animations guided by text-to-video priors. To generate natural, smooth, and coherent motion, we first parameterize the motion trajectories of the keypoints defined over the initial clipart image by cubic B\'ezier curves. We then align these motion trajectories with a given text prompt by optimizing a video Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss and a skeleton fidelity loss. By incorporating differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) shape deformation and differentiable rendering, AniClipart can be end-to-end optimized while maintaining deformation rigidity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AniClipart consistently outperforms the competing methods, in terms of text-video alignment, visual identity preservation, and temporal consistency. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of AniClipart by adapting it to generate layered animations, which allow for topological changes.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Patching via Mixture-of-Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every timestep (i.e., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every timestep with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the original dataset already used for pre-training, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Notably, DMP significantly enhances the FID of converged DiT-L/2 by 10.38% on FFHQ, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</description>

      <title>Unseen Visual Anomaly Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual anomaly detection (AD) presents significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data samples. While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</description>

      <title>The Unmet Promise of Synthetic Training Images: Using Retrieved Real Images Performs Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative text-to-image models enable us to synthesize unlimited amounts of images in a controllable manner, spurring many recent efforts to train vision models with synthetic data. However, every synthetic image ultimately originates from the upstream data used to train the generator. Does the intermediate generator provide additional information over directly training on relevant parts of the upstream data? Grounding this question in the setting of image classification, we compare finetuning on task-relevant, targeted synthetic data generated by Stable Diffusion -- a generative model trained on the LAION-2B dataset -- against finetuning on targeted real images retrieved directly from LAION-2B. We show that while synthetic data can benefit some downstream tasks, it is universally matched or outperformed by real data from the simple retrieval baseline. Our analysis suggests that this underperformance is partially due to generator artifacts and inaccurate task-relevant visual details in the synthetic images. Overall, we argue that targeted retrieval is a critical baseline to consider when training with synthetic data -- a baseline that current methods do not yet surpass. We release code, data, and models at https://github.com/scottgeng00/unmet-promise.</description>

      <title>Ctrl-X: Controlling Structure and Appearance for Text-To-Image Generation Without Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent controllable generation approaches such as FreeControl and Diffusion Self-Guidance bring fine-grained spatial and appearance control to text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models without training auxiliary modules. However, these methods optimize the latent embedding for each type of score function with longer diffusion steps, making the generation process time-consuming and limiting their flexibility and use. This work presents Ctrl-X, a simple framework for T2I diffusion controlling structure and appearance without additional training or guidance. Ctrl-X designs feed-forward structure control to enable the structure alignment with a structure image and semantic-aware appearance transfer to facilitate the appearance transfer from a user-input image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments illustrate the superior performance of Ctrl-X on various condition inputs and model checkpoints. In particular, Ctrl-X supports novel structure and appearance control with arbitrary condition images of any modality, exhibits superior image quality and appearance transfer compared to existing works, and provides instant plug-and-play functionality to any T2I and text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model. See our project page for an overview of the results: https://genforce.github.io/ctrl-x</description>

      <title>Rethinking Score Distillation as a Bridge Between Image Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these methods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image distribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF optimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</description>

      <title>TorchSpatial: A Location Encoding Framework and Benchmark for Spatial Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial representation learning (SRL) aims at learning general-purpose neural network representations from various types of spatial data (e.g., points, polylines, polygons, networks, images, etc.) in their native formats. Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware models' overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework, LocBench, and Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial.</description>

      <title>EvolvED: Evolutionary Embeddings to Understand the Generation Process of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, widely used in image generation, rely on iterative refinement to generate images from noise. Understanding this data evolution is important for model development and interpretability, yet challenging due to its high-dimensional, iterative nature. Prior works often focus on static or instance-level analyses, missing the iterative and holistic aspects of the generative path. While dimensionality reduction can visualize image evolution for few instances, it does preserve the iterative structure. To address these gaps, we introduce EvolvED, a method that presents a holistic view of the iterative generative process in diffusion models. EvolvED goes beyond instance exploration by leveraging predefined research questions to streamline generative space exploration. Tailored prompts aligned with these questions are used to extract intermediate images, preserving iterative context. Targeted feature extractors trace the evolution of key image attribute evolution, addressing the complexity of high-dimensional outputs. Central to EvolvED is a novel evolutionary embedding algorithm that encodes iterative steps while maintaining semantic relations. It enhances the visualization of data evolution by clustering semantically similar elements within each iteration with t-SNE, grouping elements by iteration, and aligning an instance's elements across iterations. We present rectilinear and radial layouts to represent iterations and support exploration. We apply EvolvED to diffusion models like GLIDE and Stable Diffusion, demonstrating its ability to provide valuable insights into the generative process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates unparalleled superior performance in 3D scene reconstruction. However, 3DGS heavily relies on the sharp images. Fulfilling this requirement can be challenging in real-world scenarios especially when the camera moves fast, which severely limits the application of 3DGS. To address these challenges, we proposed Spike Gausian Splatting (SpikeGS), the first framework that integrates the spike streams into 3DGS pipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes via a fast-moving bio-inspired camera. With accumulation rasterization, interval supervision, and a specially designed pipeline, SpikeGS extracts detailed geometry and texture from high temporal resolution but texture lacking spike stream, reconstructs 3D scenes captured in 1 second. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SpikeGS compared with existing spike-based and deblur 3D scene reconstruction methods. Codes and data will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Class Unlearning in CLIP with Synthetic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is a crucial area of research. It is driven by the need to remove sensitive information from models to safeguard individuals' right to be forgotten under rigorous regulations such as GDPR. In this work, we focus on unlearning within CLIP, a dual vision-language encoder model trained on a massive dataset of image-text pairs using contrastive loss. To achieve forgetting we expand the application of Lipschitz regularization to the multimodal context of CLIP. Specifically, we ensure the smoothing of both visual and textual embeddings associated with the class intended to be forgotten relative to the perturbation introduced to the samples from that class. Additionally, importantly, we remove the necessity for real forgetting data by generating synthetic samples through gradient ascent maximizing the target class. Our forgetting procedure is iterative, where we track accuracy on a synthetic forget set and stop when accuracy falls below a chosen threshold. We employ a selective layers update strategy based on their average absolute gradient value to mitigate over-forgetting. We validate our approach on several standard datasets and provide thorough ablation analysis and comparisons with previous work.</description>

      <title>Open-Canopy: Towards Very High Resolution Forest Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating canopy height and its changes at meter resolution from satellite imagery is a significant challenge in computer vision with critical environmental applications. However, the lack of open-access datasets at this resolution hinders the reproducibility and evaluation of models. We introduce Open-Canopy, the first open-access, country-scale benchmark for very high-resolution (1.5 m) canopy height estimation, covering over 87,000 km$^2$ across France with 1.5 m resolution satellite imagery and aerial LiDAR data. Additionally, we present Open-Canopy-$\Delta$, a benchmark for canopy height change detection between images from different years at tree level-a challenging task for current computer vision models. We evaluate state-of-the-art architectures on these benchmarks, highlighting significant challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/fajwel/Open-Canopy.</description>

      <title>StreamMOS: Streaming Moving Object Segmentation with Multi-View Perception and Dual-Span Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving object segmentation based on LiDAR is a crucial and challenging task for autonomous driving and mobile robotics. Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information from LiDAR sequences to predict moving objects in the current frame. However, they often focus on transferring temporal cues in a single inference and regard every prediction as independent of others. This may cause inconsistent segmentation results for the same object in different frames. To overcome this issue, we propose a streaming network with a memory mechanism, called StreamMOS, to build the association of features and predictions among multiple inferences. Specifically, we utilize a short-term memory to convey historical features, which can be regarded as spatial prior of moving objects and adopted to enhance current inference by temporal fusion. Meanwhile, we build a long-term memory to store previous predictions and exploit them to refine the present forecast at voxel and instance levels through voting. Besides, we present multi-view encoder with cascade projection and asymmetric convolution to extract motion feature of objects in different representations. Extensive experiments validate that our algorithm gets competitive performance on SemanticKITTI and Sipailou Campus datasets. Code will be released at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/StreamMOS.git.</description>

      <title>DEEPTalk: Dynamic Emotion Embedding for Probabilistic Speech-Driven 3D Face Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has garnered lots of attention thanks to its broad range of applications. Despite recent advancements in achieving realistic lip motion, current methods fail to capture the nuanced emotional undertones conveyed through speech and produce monotonous facial motion. These limitations result in blunt and repetitive facial animations, reducing user engagement and hindering their applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce DEEPTalk, a novel approach that generates diverse and emotionally rich 3D facial expressions directly from speech inputs. To achieve this, we first train DEE (Dynamic Emotion Embedding), which employs probabilistic contrastive learning to forge a joint emotion embedding space for both speech and facial motion. This probabilistic framework captures the uncertainty in interpreting emotions from speech and facial motion, enabling the derivation of emotion vectors from its multifaceted space. Moreover, to generate dynamic facial motion, we design TH-VQVAE (Temporally Hierarchical VQ-VAE) as an expressive and robust motion prior overcoming limitations of VAEs and VQ-VAEs. Utilizing these strong priors, we develop DEEPTalk, A talking head generator that non-autoregressively predicts codebook indices to create dynamic facial motion, incorporating a novel emotion consistency loss. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in creating diverse, emotionally expressive talking faces that maintain accurate lip-sync. Source code will be made publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</description>

      <title>TAMER: Tree-Aware Transformer for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has extensive applications in automated grading and office automation. However, existing sequence-based decoding methods, which directly predict $\LaTeX$ sequences, struggle to understand and model the inherent tree structure of $\LaTeX$ and often fail to ensure syntactic correctness in the decoded results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model named TAMER (Tree-Aware Transformer) for handwritten mathematical expression recognition. TAMER introduces an innovative Tree-aware Module while maintaining the flexibility and efficient training of Transformer. TAMER combines the advantages of both sequence decoding and tree decoding models by jointly optimizing sequence prediction and tree structure prediction tasks, which enhances the model's understanding and generalization of complex mathematical expression structures. During inference, TAMER employs a Tree Structure Prediction Scoring Mechanism to improve the structural validity of the generated $\LaTeX$ sequences. Experimental results on CROHME datasets demonstrate that TAMER outperforms traditional sequence decoding and tree decoding models, especially in handling complex mathematical structures, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Scalable Autoregressive Image Generation with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AiM, an autoregressive (AR) image generative model based on Mamba architecture. AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

      <description>arXiv:2408.13928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multimodal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10--50m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time series of climatic variables, and satellite time series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</description>

      <title>Recoverable Compression: A Multimodal Vision Token Recovery Mechanism Guided by Text Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of large-scale language modeling techniques, large multimodal models combining visual encoders with large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance in various visual tasks. Most of the current large-scale multimodal models achieve this by mapping visual features obtained from the visual encoder into a large language model and using them as inputs alongside text for downstream tasks. Therefore, the number of visual tokens directly affects the training and inference speed of the model. There has been significant work on token pruning for visual transformers, but for large multimodal models, only relying on visual information for token pruning or compression may lead to significant loss of important information. On the other hand, the textual input in the form of a question may contain valuable information that can aid in answering the question, providing additional knowledge to the model. To address the potential oversimplification and excessive pruning that can occur with most purely visual token pruning methods, we propose a text information-guided dynamic visual token recovery mechanism that does not require training. This mechanism leverages the similarity between the question text and visual tokens to recover visually meaningful tokens with important text information while merging other less important tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original approach while compressing the visual tokens to an average of 10% of the original quantity. Our source code will be made publicly available following acceptance.</description>

      <title>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Reprogramming Visual-Language Model for General Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake faces poses huge potential negative impacts on our daily lives. Despite substantial advancements in deepfake detection over these years, the generalizability of existing methods against forgeries from unseen datasets or created by emerging generative models remains constrained. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach that repurposes a well-trained VLM for general deepfake detection. Motivated by the model reprogramming paradigm that manipulates the model prediction via data perturbations, our method can reprogram a pretrained VLM model (e.g., CLIP) solely based on manipulating its input without tuning the inner parameters. Furthermore, we insert a pseudo-word guided by facial identity into the text prompt. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks demonstrate that (1) the cross-dataset and cross-manipulation performances of deepfake detection can be significantly and consistently improved (e.g., over 88% AUC in cross-dataset setting from FF++ to WildDeepfake) using a pre-trained CLIP model with our proposed reprogramming method; (2) our superior performances are at less cost of trainable parameters, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>M2OST: Many-to-one Regression for Predicting Spatial Transcriptomics from Digital Pathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has facilitated the spatially-aware profiling of gene expressions based on histopathology images. Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). The code is available at: https://github.com/Dootmaan/M2OST.</description>

      <title>Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence algorithms have demonstrated their image classification and segmentation ability in the past decade. However, artificial intelligence algorithms perform less for actual clinical data than those used for simulations. This research aims to present a novel hybrid learning model using self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation, which can achieve sufficient generalization and robustness. The self-attention mechanism and tokens employed in ViT, besides the local-to-global learning approach used in the hybrid model, enable the proposed algorithm to extract a high-dimensional and high-quality feature space from images. To demonstrate the proposed neural network's capability in classifying and extracting feature spaces from medical images, we use it on a dataset of Diabetic Retinopathy images, specifically the EyePACS dataset. This dataset is more complex structurally and challenging regarding damaged areas than other medical images. For the first time in this study, self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation are used to classify this dataset. In our algorithm, for the first time among all self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation models, the test dataset is 50% larger than the training dataset. Unlike many studies, we have not removed any images from the dataset. Finally, our algorithm achieved an accuracy of 79.1% in the linear classifier and 74.36% in the k-NN algorithm for multiclass classification. Compared to a similar state-of-the-art model, our results achieved higher accuracy and more effective representation spaces.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach for pose and burial fraction estimation of debris field barrels found on the seabed in the Southern California San Pedro Basin. Our computational workflow leverages recent advances in foundation models for segmentation and a vision transformer-based approach to estimate the point cloud which defines the geometry of the barrel. We propose BarrelNet for estimating the 6-DOF pose and radius of buried barrels from the barrel point clouds as input. We train BarrelNet using synthetically generated barrel point clouds, and qualitatively demonstrate the potential of our approach using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video footage of barrels found at a historic dump site. We compare our method to a traditional least squares fitting approach and show significant improvement according to our defined benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exceled in novel view synthesis (NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However, it faces challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address this issue, we propose Super-Resolution 3DGS (SuperGS), which is an expansion of 3DGS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In this framework, we use a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, serving as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization. Additionally, we introduce variational residual features to enhance high-resolution details, using their variance as uncertainty estimates to guide the densification process and loss computation. Furthermore, the introduction of a multi-view joint learning approach helps mitigate ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS surpasses state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on both real-world and synthetic datasets using only low-resolution inputs.

      <title>Animate-X: Universal Character Image Animation with Enhanced Motion Representation</title>

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in industries like gaming and entertainment. Our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes Animate-X, a universal animation framework based on LDM for various character types (collectively named X), including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation, we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions, while the latter strengthens the generalization of LDM by simulating possible inputs in advance that may arise during inference. Moreover, we introduce a new Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A^2Bench) to evaluate the performance of Animate-X on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: High-throughput image analysis in the biomedical domain has gained significant attention in recent years, driving advancements in drug discovery, disease prediction, and personalized medicine. Organoids, specifically, are an active area of research, providing excellent models for human organs and their functions. Automating the quantification of organoids in microscopy images would provide an effective solution to overcome substantial manual quantification bottlenecks, particularly in high-throughput image analysis. However, there is a notable lack of open biomedical datasets, in contrast to other domains, such as autonomous driving, and, notably, only few of them have attempted to quantify annotation uncertainty. In this work, we present MultiOrg a comprehensive organoid dataset tailored for object detection tasks with uncertainty quantification. This dataset comprises over 400 high-resolution 2d microscopy images and curated annotations of more than 60,000 organoids. Most importantly, it includes three label sets for the test data, independently annotated by two experts at distinct time points. We additionally provide a benchmark for organoid detection, and make the best model available through an easily installable, interactive plugin for the popular image visualization tool Napari, to perform organoid quantification.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Pre-training of Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Medical Image Classification in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) diagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the ViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third place in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762 and a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched EndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.</description>

      <title>CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Recipe Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the potential applications of generating recipes from food images, this area has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. Existing works for recipe generation primarily utilize a two-stage training method, first generating ingredients and then obtaining instructions from both the image and ingredients. Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), which have achieved notable success across a variety of vision and language tasks, shed light to generating both ingredients and instructions directly from images. Nevertheless, LMMs still face the common issue of hallucinations during recipe generation, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this, we propose a retrieval augmented large multimodal model for recipe generation. We first introduce Stochastic Diversified Retrieval Augmentation (SDRA) to retrieve recipes semantically related to the image from an existing datastore as a supplement, integrating them into the prompt to add diverse and rich context to the input image. Additionally, Self-Consistency Ensemble Voting mechanism is proposed to determine the most confident prediction recipes as the final output. It calculates the consistency among generated recipe candidates, which use different retrieval recipes as context for generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in recipe generation tasks on the Recipe1M dataset.</description>

      <title>Skeleton-Guided Spatial-Temporal Feature Learning for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-based visible-infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) is challenging due to significant modality feature discrepancies. Spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial, but the accuracy of spatial-temporal information is often influenced by issues like low quality and occlusions in videos. Existing methods mainly focus on reducing modality differences, but pay limited attention to improving spatial-temporal features, particularly for infrared videos. To address this, we propose a novel Skeleton-guided spatial-Temporal feAture leaRning (STAR) method for VVI-ReID. By using skeleton information, which is robust to issues such as poor image quality and occlusions, STAR improves the accuracy of spatial-temporal features in videos of both modalities. Specifically, STAR employs two levels of skeleton-guided strategies: frame level and sequence level. At the frame level, the robust structured skeleton information is used to refine the visual features of individual frames. At the sequence level, we design a feature aggregation mechanism based on skeleton key points graph, which learns the contribution of different body parts to spatial-temporal features, further enhancing the accuracy of global features. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code will be open source soon.</description>

Abstract: Stereo matching has been a pivotal component in 3D vision, aiming to find corresponding points between pairs of stereo images to recover depth information. In this work, we introduce StereoAnything, a highly practical solution for robust stereo matching. Rather than focusing on a specialized model, our goal is to develop a versatile foundational model capable of handling stereo images across diverse environments. To this end, we scale up the dataset by collecting labeled stereo images and generating synthetic stereo pairs from unlabeled monocular images. To further enrich the model's ability to generalize across different conditions, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that complements existing data by adding variability in baselines, camera angles, and scene types. We extensively evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our model on five public datasets, showcasing its impressive ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

      <description>arXiv:2411.16213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Endeavors have been made to explore Large Language Models for video analysis (Video-LLMs), particularly in understanding and interpreting long videos. However, existing Video-LLMs still face challenges in effectively integrating the rich and diverse audio-visual information inherent in long videos, which is crucial for comprehensive understanding. This raises the question: how can we leverage embedded audio-visual information to enhance long video understanding? Therefore, (i) we introduce SAVEn-Vid, the first-ever long audio-visual video dataset comprising over 58k audio-visual instructions. (ii) From the model perspective, we propose a time-aware Audio-Visual Large Language Model (AV-LLM), SAVEnVideo, fine-tuned on SAVEn-Vid. (iii) Besides, we present AVBench, a benchmark containing 2,500 QAs designed to evaluate models on enhanced audio-visual comprehension tasks within long video, challenging their ability to handle intricate audio-visual interactions. Experiments on AVBench reveal the limitations of current AV-LLMs. Experiments also demonstrate that SAVEnVideo outperforms the best Video-LLM by 3.61% on the zero-shot long video task (Video-MME) and surpasses the leading audio-visual LLM by 1.29% on the zero-shot audio-visual task (Music-AVQA). Consequently, at the 7B parameter scale, SAVEnVideo can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our dataset and code will be released at https://ljungang.github.io/SAVEn-Vid/ upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>DGNN-YOLO: Interpretable Dynamic Graph Neural Networks with YOLO11 for Small Object Detection and Tracking in Traffic Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes, is critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial for improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates a DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thereby ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques were applied to DGNN-YOLO to provide model-agnostic interpretability and deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing its transparency and trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This study provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block Dual Fusion of Whole Slide Images and Omics Data for Precision Oncology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of DNA methylation data with a Whole Slide Image (WSI) offers significant potential for enhancing the diagnostic precision of central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification in neuropathology. While existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late fusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during early and late fusion to capture complementary information from local (patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance through multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively incorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These embeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention mechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>LineGS : 3D Line Segment Representation on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract representations of 3D scenes play a crucial role in computer vision, enabling a wide range of applications such as mapping, localization, surface reconstruction, and even advanced tasks like SLAM and rendering. Among these representations, line segments are widely used because of their ability to succinctly capture the structural features of a scene. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods often face significant challenges. Methods relying on 2D projections suffer from instability caused by errors in multi-view matching and occlusions, while direct 3D approaches are hampered by noise and sparsity in 3D point cloud data. This paper introduces LineGS, a novel method that combines geometry-guided 3D line reconstruction with a 3D Gaussian splatting model to address these challenges and improve representation ability. The method leverages the high-density Gaussian point distributions along the edge of the scene to refine and optimize initial line segments generated from traditional geometric approaches. By aligning these segments with the underlying geometric features of the scene, LineGS achieves a more precise and reliable representation of 3D structures. The results show significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and model compactness compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Local vs. Global: Local Land-Use and Land-Cover Models Deliver Higher Quality Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, 58.0% of the African population experienced moderate to severe food insecurity, with 21.6% facing severe food insecurity. Land-use and land-cover maps provide crucial insights for addressing food insecurity by improving agricultural efforts, including mapping and monitoring crop types and estimating yield. The development of global land-cover maps has been facilitated by the increasing availability of earth observation data and advancements in geospatial machine learning. However, these global maps exhibit lower accuracy and inconsistencies in Africa, partly due to the lack of representative training data. To address this issue, we propose a data-centric framework with a teacher-student model setup, which uses diverse data sources of satellite images and label examples to produce local land-cover maps. Our method trains a high-resolution teacher model on images with a resolution of 0.331 m/pixel and a low-resolution student model on publicly available images with a resolution of 10 m/pixel. The student model also utilizes the teacher model's output as its weak label examples through knowledge transfer. We evaluated our framework using Murang'a county in Kenya, renowned for its agricultural productivity, as a use case. Our local models achieved higher quality maps, with improvements of 0.14 in the F1 score and 0.21 in Intersection-over-Union, compared to the best global model. Our evaluation also revealed inconsistencies in existing global maps, with a maximum agreement rate of 0.30 among themselves. Our work provides valuable guidance to decision-makers for driving informed decisions to enhance food security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational pathology have produced patch-level Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but these models are limited by their inability to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and their tendency to bypass crucial morphological features that pathologists rely on for diagnosis. To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>AdvDreamer Unveils: Are Vision-Language Models Truly Ready for Real-World 3D Variations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, yet their robustness in dynamic real-world scenarios remains largely unexplored. To systematically evaluate VLMs' robustness to real-world 3D variations, we propose AdvDreamer, the first framework that generates physically reproducible adversarial 3D transformation (Adv-3DT) samples from single-view images. AdvDreamer integrates advanced generative techniques with two key innovations and aims to characterize the worst-case distributions of 3D variations from natural images. To ensure adversarial effectiveness and method generality, we introduce an Inverse Semantic Probability Objective that executes adversarial optimization on fundamental vision-text alignment spaces, which can be generalizable across different VLM architectures and downstream tasks. To mitigate the distribution discrepancy between generated and real-world samples while maintaining physical reproducibility, we design a Naturalness Reward Model that provides regularization feedback during adversarial optimization, preventing convergence towards hallucinated and unnatural elements. Leveraging AdvDreamer, we establish MM3DTBench, the first VQA dataset for benchmarking VLMs' 3D variations robustness. Extensive evaluations on representative VLMs with diverse architectures highlight that 3D variations in the real world may pose severe threats to model performance across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Real&amp;Synthetic Dataset and Linear Attention in Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs, with recent deep learning advancements significantly enhancing performance. However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</description>

      <title>Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</description>

      <title>MixedGaussianAvatar: Realistically and Geometrically Accurate Head Avatar via Mixed 2D-3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head avatars is crucial in various applications such as virtual reality. The pioneering methods reconstruct realistic head avatars with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which have been limited by training and rendering speed. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improve the efficiency of training and rendering. However, the surface inconsistency of 3DGS results in subpar geometric accuracy; later, 2DGS uses 2D surfels to enhance geometric accuracy at the expense of rendering fidelity. To leverage the benefits of both 2DGS and 3DGS, we propose a novel method named MixedGaussianAvatar for realistically and geometrically accurate head avatar reconstruction. Our main idea is to utilize 2D Gaussians to reconstruct the surface of the 3D head, ensuring geometric accuracy. We attach the 2D Gaussians to the triangular mesh of the FLAME model and connect additional 3D Gaussians to those 2D Gaussians where the rendering quality of 2DGS is inadequate, creating a mixed 2D-3D Gaussian representation. These 2D-3D Gaussians can then be animated using FLAME parameters. We further introduce a progressive training strategy that first trains the 2D Gaussians and then fine-tunes the mixed 2D-3D Gaussians. We demonstrate the superiority of MixedGaussianAvatar through comprehensive experiments. The code will be released at: https://github.com/ChenVoid/MGA/.</description>

      <title>LinVT: Empower Your Image-level Large Language Model to Understand Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in various tasks, motivating us to develop an LLM-based assistant for videos. Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.</description>

      <title>Stag-1: Towards Realistic 4D Driving Simulation with Video Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4D driving simulation is essential for developing realistic autonomous driving simulators. Despite advancements in existing methods for generating driving scenes, significant challenges remain in view transformation and spatial-temporal dynamic modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct real-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D simulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using surround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal relationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1 leverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D driving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view generation, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses, enhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct vehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views, enabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension. Following extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any desired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under static spatial-temporal conditions. Compared to existing methods, our approach shows promising performance in multi-view scene consistency, background coherence, and accuracy, and contributes to the ongoing advancements in realistic autonomous driving simulation.

      <description>arXiv:2412.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable diffusion plays a crucial role in generating high-quality images. However, image generation is time-consuming and memory-intensive. To address this, stable-diffusion.cpp (Sdcpp) emerges as an efficient inference framework to accelerate the diffusion models. Although it is lightweight, the current implementation of ggml_conv_2d operator in Sdcpp is suboptimal, exhibiting both high inference latency and massive memory usage. To address this, in this work, we present an optimized version of Sdcpp leveraging the Winograd algorithm to accelerate 2D convolution operations, which is the primary bottleneck in the pipeline. By analyzing both dependent and independent computation graphs, we exploit the device's locality and parallelism to achieve substantial performance improvements. Our framework delivers correct end-to-end results across various stable diffusion models, including SDv1.4, v1.5, v2.1, SDXL, and SDXL-Turbo. Our evaluation results demonstrate a speedup up to 2.76x for individual convolutional layers and an inference speedup up to 4.79x for the overall image generation process, compared with the original Sdcpp on M1 pro.

      <description>arXiv:2412.05871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Maritime Ship Navigation Behavior Dataset (MID), designed to address challenges in ship detection within complex maritime environments using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB). MID contains 5,673 images with 135,884 finely annotated target instances, supporting both supervised and semi-supervised learning. It features diverse maritime scenarios such as ship encounters under varying weather, docking maneuvers, small target clustering, and partial occlusions, filling critical gaps in datasets like HRSID, SSDD, and NWPU-10. MID's images are sourced from high-definition video clips of real-world navigation across 43 water areas, with varied weather and lighting conditions (e.g., rain, fog). Manually curated annotations enhance the dataset's variety, ensuring its applicability to real-world demands in busy ports and dense maritime regions. This diversity equips models trained on MID to better handle complex, dynamic environments, supporting advancements in maritime situational awareness. To validate MID's utility, we evaluated 10 detection algorithms, providing an in-depth analysis of the dataset, detection results from various models, and a comparative study of baseline algorithms, with a focus on handling occlusions and dense target clusters. The results highlight MID's potential to drive innovation in intelligent maritime traffic monitoring and autonomous navigation systems. The dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VirtualNew/MID_DataSet.</description>

      <title>Robust Noisy Correspondence Learning via Self-Drop and Dual-Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many researchers collect data from the internet through crowd-sourcing or web crawling to alleviate the data-hungry challenge associated with cross-modal matching. Although such practice does not require expensive annotations, it inevitably introduces mismatched pairs and results in a noisy correspondence problem. Current approaches leverage the memorization effect of deep neural networks to distinguish noise and perform re-weighting. However, briefly lowering the weight of noisy pairs cannot eliminate the negative impact of noisy correspondence in the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel self-drop and dual-weight approach, which achieves elaborate data processing by qua-partitioning the data. Specifically, our approach partitions all data into four types: clean and significant, clean yet insignificant, vague, and noisy. We analyze the effect of noisy and clean data pairs and find that for vision-language pre-training models, a small number of clean samples is more valuable than a majority of noisy ones. Based on this observation, we employ self-drop to discard noisy samples to effectively mitigate the impact of noise. In addition, we adopt a dual-weight strategy to ensure that the model focuses more on significant samples while appropriately leveraging vague samples. Compared to the prior works, our approach is more robust and demonstrates relatively more stable performance on noisy datasets, especially under a high noise ratio. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets, including Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions, validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long video understanding has become a critical task in computer vision, driving advancements across numerous applications from surveillance to content retrieval. Existing video understanding methods suffer from two challenges when dealing with long video understanding: intricate long-context relationship modeling and interference from redundancy. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fine-Detailed Video Story generation (FDVS), which interprets long videos into detailed textual representations. Specifically, to achieve fine-grained modeling of long-temporal content, we propose a Bottom-up Video Interpretation Mechanism that progressively interprets video content from clips to video. To avoid interference from redundant information in videos, we introduce a Semantic Redundancy Reduction mechanism that removes redundancy at both the visual and textual levels. Our method transforms long videos into hierarchical textual representations that contain multi-granularity information of the video. With these representations, FDVS is applicable to various tasks without any fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed method across eight datasets spanning three tasks. The performance demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing image segmentation is essential for accurately identifying detailed objects in remote sensing images. Recently, vision transformer models (VTMs) pre-trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization. However, directly applying them to specific tasks may lead to domain shift. We introduce a novel end-to-end learning paradigm combining knowledge guidance with domain refinement to enhance performance. We present two key components: the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) and the Feature Modulation Module (FMM). FAM aligns features from a CNN-based backbone with those from the pretrained VTM's encoder using channel transformation and spatial interpolation, and transfers knowledge via KL divergence and L2 normalization constraint. FMM further adapts the knowledge to the specific domain to address domain shift. We also introduce a fine-grained grass segmentation dataset and demonstrate, through experiments on two datasets, that our method achieves a significant improvement of 2.57 mIoU on the grass dataset and 3.73 mIoU on the cloud dataset. The results highlight the potential of combining knowledge transfer and domain adaptation to overcome domain-related challenges and data limitations.

      <title>ProVision: Programmatically Scaling Vision-centric Instruction Data for Multimodal Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of multimodal applications, instruction data has become critical for training multimodal language models capable of understanding complex image-based queries. Existing practices rely on powerful but costly large language models (LLMs) or multimodal language models (MLMs) to produce instruction data. These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and the generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. In this work, we present a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic representations of images and human-written programs to systematically synthesize vision-centric instruction data. Our approach ensures the interpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales efficiently while maintaining factual accuracy. By implementing a suite of 24 single-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph generation pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision which produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes, relations, depth, etc., for any given image. Applied to Visual Genome and DataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points, ProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning stages of MLMs. When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image instruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D split of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2, RealWorldQA, and MMMU. Our multi-image instruction data leads to an 8% improvement on Mantis-Eval. Incorporation of our data in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of xGen-MM-4B leads to an averaged improvement of 1.6% across 11 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CADSpotting: Robust Panoptic Symbol Spotting on Large-Scale CAD Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CADSpotting, an efficient method for panoptic symbol spotting in large-scale architectural CAD drawings. Existing approaches struggle with the diversity of symbols, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing each primitive with dense points instead of a single primitive point, described by essential attributes like coordinates and color. Building upon a unified 3D point cloud model for joint semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, CADSpotting learns robust feature representations. To enable accurate segmentation in large, complex drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique, combining weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce a large-scale CAD dataset named LS-CAD to support our experiments. Each floorplan in LS-CAD has an average coverage of 1,000 square meter(versus 100 square meter in the existing dataset), providing a valuable benchmark for symbol spotting research. Experimental results on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD datasets demonstrate that CADSpotting outperforms existing methods, showcasing its robustness and scalability for real-world CAD applications.</description>

      <title>Test-time Correction with Human Feedback: An Online 3D Detection System via Visual Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Test-time Correction (TTC) system, a novel online 3D detection system designated for online correction of test-time errors via human feedback, to guarantee the safety of deployed autonomous driving systems. Unlike well-studied offline 3D detectors frozen at inference, TTC explores the capability of instant online error rectification. By leveraging user feedback with interactive prompts at a frame, e.g., a simple click or draw of boxes, TTC could immediately update the corresponding detection results for future streaming inputs, even though the model is deployed with fixed parameters. This enables autonomous driving systems to adapt to new scenarios immediately and decrease deployment risks reliably without additional expensive training. To achieve such TTC system, we equip existing 3D detectors with Online Adapter (OA) module, a prompt-driven query generator for online correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts, images of missed object-of-interest for guiding the corresponding detection and subsequent tracking. Those visual prompts, belonging to missed objects through online inference, are maintained by the visual prompt buffer for continuous error correction in subsequent frames. By doing so, TTC consistently detects online missed objects and immediately lowers driving risks. It achieves reliable, versatile, and adaptive driving autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant gain on instant error rectification over pre-trained 3D detectors, even in challenging scenarios with limited labels, zero-shot detection, and adverse conditions. We hope this work would inspire the community to investigate online rectification systems for autonomous driving post-deployment. Code would be publicly shared.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.

      <title>MoMA: Momentum Contrastive Learning with Multi-head Attention-based Knowledge Distillation for Histopathology Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no doubt that advanced artificial intelligence models and high quality data are the keys to success in developing computational pathology tools. Although the overall volume of pathology data keeps increasing, a lack of quality data is a common issue when it comes to a specific task due to several reasons including privacy and ethical issues with patient data. In this work, we propose to exploit knowledge distillation, i.e., utilize the existing model to learn a new, target model, to overcome such issues in computational pathology. Specifically, we employ a student-teacher framework to learn a target model from a pre-trained, teacher model without direct access to source data and distill relevant knowledge via momentum contrastive learning with multi-head attention mechanism, which provides consistent and context-aware feature representations. This enables the target model to assimilate informative representations of the teacher model while seamlessly adapting to the unique nuances of the target data. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated across different scenarios where the teacher model was trained on the same, relevant, and irrelevant classification tasks with the target model. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach in transferring knowledge to different domains and tasks, outperforming other related methods. Moreover, the results provide a guideline on the learning strategy for different types of tasks and scenarios in computational pathology.

      <title>Weighted Ensemble Models Are Strong Continual Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of continual learning (CL) where the goal is to learn a model on a sequence of tasks, such that the data from the previous tasks becomes unavailable while learning on the current task data. CL is essentially a balancing act between being able to learn on the new task (i.e., plasticity) and maintaining the performance on the previously learned concepts (i.e., stability). Intending to address the stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose to perform weight-ensembling of the model parameters of the previous and current tasks. This weighted-ensembled model, which we call Continual Model Averaging (or CoMA), attains high accuracy on the current task by leveraging plasticity, while not deviating too far from the previous weight configuration, ensuring stability. We also propose an improved variant of CoMA, named Continual Fisher-weighted Model Averaging (or CoFiMA), that selectively weighs each parameter in the weights ensemble by leveraging the Fisher information of the weights of the model. Both variants are conceptually simple, easy to implement, and effective in attaining state-of-the-art performance on several standard CL benchmarks.

      <title>Exploring Masked Autoencoders for Sensor-Agnostic Image Retrieval in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders (MAEs) has recently attracted great attention for remote sensing (RS) image representation learning, and thus embodies a significant potential for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) from ever-growing RS image archives. However, the existing MAE based CBIR studies in RS assume that the considered RS images are acquired by a single image sensor, and thus are only suitable for uni-modal CBIR problems. The effectiveness of MAEs for cross-sensor CBIR, which aims to search semantically similar images across different image modalities, has not been explored yet. In this paper, we take the first step to explore the effectiveness of MAEs for sensor-agnostic CBIR in RS. To this end, we present a systematic overview on the possible adaptations of the vanilla MAE to exploit masked image modeling on multi-sensor RS image archives (denoted as cross-sensor masked autoencoders [CSMAEs]) in the context of CBIR. Based on different adjustments applied to the vanilla MAE, we introduce different CSMAE models. We also provide an extensive experimental analysis of these CSMAE models. We finally derive a guideline to exploit masked image modeling for uni-modal and cross-modal CBIR problems in RS. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/jakhac/CSMAE.</description>

      <title>Fusing Domain-Specific Content from Large Language Models into Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Zero Shot Object State Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge can significantly contribute to addressing a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the generation of such knowledge entails considerable human labor and time costs. This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating and providing domain-specific information through semantic embeddings. To achieve this, an LLM is integrated into a pipeline that utilizes Knowledge Graphs and pre-trained semantic vectors in the context of the Vision-based Zero-shot Object State Classification task. We thoroughly examine the behavior of the LLM through an extensive ablation study. Our findings reveal that the integration of LLM-based embeddings, in combination with general-purpose pre-trained embeddings, leads to substantial performance improvements. Drawing insights from this ablation study, we conduct a comparative analysis against competing models, thereby highlighting the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Structured Unrestricted-Rank Matrices for Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei et al., 2022). However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is expensive due to their large parameter counts. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative by allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on structured unrestricted-rank matrices (SURM) which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA. Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs provides more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. This is achieved by using low displacement rank matrices (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before. SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget. SURMs achieve 5-7% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA. It also results in up to 12x reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent agents must autonomously interact with the environments to perform daily tasks based on human-level instructions. They need a foundational understanding of the world to accurately interpret these instructions, along with precise low-level movement and interaction skills to execute the derived actions. In this work, we propose the first complete system for synthesizing physically plausible, long-horizon human-object interactions for object manipulation in contextual environments, driven by human-level instructions. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Image Dataset Features on Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is crucial in many sectors, including computer vision. However, ML models trained on sensitive data face security challenges, as they can be attacked and leak information. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this by using Differential Privacy (DP) to balance utility and privacy. This study identifies image dataset characteristics that affect the utility and vulnerability of private and non-private Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Through analyzing multiple datasets and privacy budgets, we find that imbalanced datasets increase vulnerability in minority classes, but DP mitigates this issue. Datasets with fewer classes improve both model utility and privacy, while high entropy or low Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) datasets deteriorate the utility-privacy trade-off. These insights offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in estimating and optimizing the utility-privacy trade-off in image datasets, helping to inform data and privacy modifications for better outcomes based on dataset characteristics.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Number of HTTP/3 Responses in QUIC Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QUIC, a new and increasingly used transport protocol, enhances TCP by offering improved security, performance, and stream multiplexing. These features, however, also impose challenges for network middle-boxes that need to monitor and analyze web traffic. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of HTTP/3 responses in a given QUIC connection by an observer. This estimation reveals server behavior, client-server interactions, and data transmission efficiency, which is crucial for various applications such as designing a load balancing solution and detecting HTTP/3 flood attacks. The proposed scheme transforms QUIC connection traces into image sequences and uses machine learning (ML) models, guided by a tailored loss function, to predict response counts. Evaluations on more than seven million images-derived from 100,000 traces collected across 44,000 websites over four months-achieve up to 97% accuracy in both known and unknown server settings and 92% accuracy on previously unseen complete QUIC traces.</description>

      <title>Discretized Gaussian Representation for Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely used imaging technique that provides detailed cross-sectional views of objects. Over the past decade, Deep Learning-based Reconstruction (DLR) methods have led efforts to enhance image quality and reduce noise, yet they often require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive. Inspired by recent advancements in scene reconstruction, some approaches have adapted NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for CT reconstruction. However, these methods are not ideal for direct 3D volume reconstruction. In this paper, we reconsider the representation of CT reconstruction and propose a novel Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR) specifically designed for CT. Unlike the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting, our representation directly reconstructs the 3D volume using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a Fast Volume Reconstruction technique that efficiently aggregates the contributions of these Gaussians into a discretized volume. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Our code has been provided for review purposes and will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) provides highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) medical images but is costly, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in intraoperative settings (Organization et al. 2011). Recent advancements have explored reconstructing 3D chest volumes from sparse 2D X-rays, such as single-view or orthogonal double-view images. However, current models tend to process 2D images in a planar manner, prioritizing visual realism over structural accuracy. In this work, we introduce DuoLift Generative Adversarial Networks (DuoLift-GAN), a novel architecture with dual branches that independently elevate 2D images and their features into 3D representations. These 3D outputs are merged into a unified 3D feature map and decoded into a complete 3D chest volume, enabling richer 3D information capture. We also present a masked loss function that directs reconstruction towards critical anatomical regions, improving structural accuracy and visual quality. This paper demonstrates that DuoLift-GAN significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy while achieving superior visual realism compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis Denoisers for Forward-Backward Plug-and-Play Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</description>

      <title>DexHandDiff: Interaction-aware Diffusion Planning for Adaptive Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves 70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>INRetouch: Context Aware Implicit Neural Representation for Photography Retouching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03848</link>

Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. With the ubiquity of smartphone photography, there is an increasing demand for accessible yet sophisticated image editing solutions. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, requiring no pretraining and capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

      <title>Video Quality Assessment: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is an important processing task, aiming at predicting the quality of videos in a manner highly consistent with human judgments of perceived quality. Traditional VQA models based on natural image and/or video statistics, which are inspired both by models of projected images of the real world and by dual models of the human visual system, deliver only limited prediction performances on real-world user-generated content (UGC), as exemplified in recent large-scale VQA databases containing large numbers of diverse video contents crawled from the web. Fortunately, recent advances in deep neural networks and Large Multimodality Models (LMMs) have enabled significant progress in solving this problem, yielding better results than prior handcrafted models. Numerous deep learning-based VQA models have been developed, with progress in this direction driven by the creation of content-diverse, large-scale human-labeled databases that supply ground truth psychometric video quality data. Here, we present a comprehensive survey of recent progress in the development of VQA algorithms and the benchmarking studies and databases that make them possible. We also analyze open research directions on study design and VQA algorithm architectures. Github link: https://github.com/taco-group/Video-Quality-Assessment-A-Comprehensive-Survey.</description>

      <title>Rate-In: Information-Driven Adaptive Dropout Rates for Improved Inference-Time Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for deploying neural networks in risk-sensitive applications such as medical diagnosis. Monte Carlo Dropout is a widely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performing stochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using static dropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertainty estimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individual inputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during training using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that cannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in Monte Carlo simulations.
  In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts dropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by dropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise injection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts dropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth labels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we adaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse medical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical study on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that Rate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to fixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance. Rate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing dropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical applications.</description>

      <title>Motion Artifact Removal in Pixel-Frequency Domain via Alternate Masks and Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion artifacts present in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can seriously interfere with clinical diagnosis. Removing motion artifacts is a straightforward solution and has been extensively studied. However, paired data are still heavily relied on in recent works and the perturbations in k-space (frequency domain) are not well considered, which limits their applications in the clinical field. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised purification method which leverages pixel-frequency information of noisy MRI images to guide a pre-trained diffusion model to recover clean MRI images. Specifically, considering that motion artifacts are mainly concentrated in high-frequency components in k-space, we utilize the low-frequency components as the guide to ensure correct tissue textures. Additionally, given that high-frequency and pixel information are helpful for recovering shape and detail textures, we design alternate complementary masks to simultaneously destroy the artifact structure and exploit useful information. Quantitative experiments are performed on datasets from different tissues and show that our method achieves superior performance on several metrics. Qualitative evaluations with radiologists also show that our method provides better clinical feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/medcx/PFAD.</description>
