      <title>Examining Two Hop Reasoning Through Information Content Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work has found that transformers have an inconsistent ability to learn to answer latent two-hop questions -- questions of the form "Who is Bob's mother's boss?" We study why this is the case by examining how transformers' capacity to learn datasets of two-hop questions and answers (two-hop QA) scales with their size, motivated by prior work on transformer knowledge capacity for simple factual memorization. We find that capacity scaling and generalization both support the hypothesis that latent two-hop QA requires transformers to learn each fact twice, while two-hop QA with chain of thought does not. We also show that with appropriate dataset parameters, it is possible to "trap" very small models in a regime where they memorize answers to two-hop questions independently, even though they would perform better if they could learn to answer them with function composition. Our findings show that measurement of capacity scaling can complement existing interpretability methods, though there are challenges in using it for this purpose.</description>

      <title>YINYANG-ALIGN: Benchmarking Contradictory Objectives and Proposing Multi-Objective Optimization based DPO for Text-to-Image Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise alignment in Text-to-Image (T2I) systems is crucial to ensure that generated visuals not only accurately encapsulate user intents but also conform to stringent ethical and aesthetic benchmarks. Incidents like the Google Gemini fiasco, where misaligned outputs triggered significant public backlash, underscore the critical need for robust alignment mechanisms. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in alignment. Building on these advancements, researchers are eager to apply similar alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to T2I systems to enhance image generation fidelity and reliability.
  We present YinYangAlign, an advanced benchmarking framework that systematically quantifies the alignment fidelity of T2I systems, addressing six fundamental and inherently contradictory design objectives. Each pair represents fundamental tensions in image generation, such as balancing adherence to user prompts with creative modifications or maintaining diversity alongside visual coherence. YinYangAlign includes detailed axiom datasets featuring human prompts, aligned (chosen) responses, misaligned (rejected) AI-generated outputs, and explanations of the underlying contradictions.</description>

      <title>Gold-medalist Performance in Solving Olympiad Geometry with AlphaGeometry2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with other additions, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that combines multiple search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for $\textit{all}$ geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Online Learning Efficiency Through Heterogeneous Resource Integration with a Multi-Agent RAG System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient online learning requires seamless access to diverse resources such as videos, code repositories, documentation, and general web content. This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information. By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience. A preliminary user study confirmed the system's strong usability and moderate-high utility, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.</description>

      <title>Fine, I'll Merge It Myself: A Multi-Fidelity Framework for Automated Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.</description>

      <title>Strategic Learning with Local Explanations as Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate algorithmic decision problems where agents can respond strategically to the decision maker's (DM) models. The demand for clear and actionable explanations from DMs to (potentially strategic) agents continues to rise. While prior work often treats explanations as full model disclosures, explanations in practice might convey only partial information, which can lead to misinterpretations and harmful responses. When full disclosure of the predictive model is neither feasible nor desirable, a key open question is how DMs can use explanations to maximise their utility without compromising agent welfare. In this work, we explore well-known local and global explanation methods, and establish a necessary condition to prevent explanations from misleading agents into self-harming actions. Moreover, with conditional homogeneity, we establish that action recommendation (AR)-based explanations are sufficient for non-harmful responses, akin to the revelation principle in information design. To operationalise AR-based explanations, we propose a simple algorithm to jointly optimise the predictive model and AR policy to balance DM outcomes with agent welfare. Our empirical results demonstrate the benefits of this approach as a more refined strategy for safe and effective partial model disclosure in algorithmic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Risk Metrics for Systemically Safe AI: Gatekeeping Multi-Agent Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.</description>

      <title>Strong Equivalence in Answer Set Programming with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of strong equivalence within the extended framework of Answer Set Programming with constraints. Two groups of rules are considered strongly equivalent if, informally speaking, they have the same meaning in any context. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, strong equivalence between rule sets in this extended setting can be precisely characterized by their equivalence in the logic of Here-and-There with constraints. Furthermore, we present a translation from the language of several clingo-based answer set solvers that handle constraints into the language of Here-and-There with constraints. This translation enables us to leverage the logic of Here-and-There to reason about strong equivalence within the context of these solvers. We also explore the computational complexity of determining strong equivalence in this context.</description>

      <title>Where AI Assurance Might Go Wrong: Initial lessons from engineering of critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw on our experience working on system and software assurance and evaluation for systems important to society to summarise how safety engineering is performed in traditional critical systems, such as aircraft flight control. We analyse how this critical systems perspective might support the development and implementation of AI Safety Frameworks. We present the analysis in terms of: system engineering, safety and risk analysis, and decision analysis and support.
  We consider four key questions: What is the system? How good does it have to be? What is the impact of criticality on system development? and How much should we trust it? We identify topics worthy of further discussion. In particular, we are concerned that system boundaries are not broad enough, that the tolerability and nature of the risks are not sufficiently elaborated, and that the assurance methods lack theories that would allow behaviours to be adequately assured.
  We advocate the use of assurance cases based on Assurance 2.0 to support decision making in which the criticality of the decision as well as the criticality of the system are evaluated. We point out the orders of magnitude difference in confidence needed in critical rather than everyday systems and how everyday techniques do not scale in rigour.
  Finally we map our findings in detail to two of the questions posed by the FAISC organisers and we note that the engineering of critical systems has evolved through open and diverse discussion. We hope that topics identified here will support the post-FAISC dialogues.</description>

      <title>A Capability Approach to AI Ethics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conceptualization and implementation of AI ethics via the capability approach. We aim to show that conceptualizing AI ethics through the capability approach has two main advantages for AI ethics as a discipline. First, it helps clarify the ethical dimension of AI tools. Second, it provides guidance to implementing ethical considerations within the design of AI tools. We illustrate these advantages in the context of AI tools in medicine, by showing how ethics-based auditing of AI tools in medicine can greatly benefit from our capability-based approach.</description>

      <title>Can Domain Experts Rely on AI Appropriately? A Case Study on AI-Assisted Prostate Cancer MRI Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in human-AI decision making, experimental studies with domain experts remain rare, largely due to the complexity of working with domain experts and the challenges in setting up realistic experiments. In this work, we conduct an in-depth collaboration with radiologists in prostate cancer diagnosis based on MRI images. Building on existing tools for teaching prostate cancer diagnosis, we develop an interface and conduct two experiments to study how AI assistance and performance feedback shape the decision making of domain experts. In Study 1, clinicians were asked to provide an initial diagnosis (human), then view the AI's prediction, and subsequently finalize their decision (human-AI team). In Study 2 (after a memory wash-out period), the same participants first received aggregated performance statistics from Study 1, specifically their own performance, the AI's performance, and their human-AI team performance, and then directly viewed the AI's prediction before making their diagnosis (i.e., no independent initial diagnosis). These two workflows represent realistic ways that clinical AI tools might be used in practice, where the second study simulates a scenario where doctors can adjust their reliance and trust on AI based on prior performance feedback. Our findings show that, while human-AI teams consistently outperform humans alone, they still underperform the AI due to under-reliance, similar to prior studies with crowdworkers. Providing clinicians with performance feedback did not significantly improve the performance of human-AI teams, although showing AI decisions in advance nudges people to follow AI more. Meanwhile, we observe that the ensemble of human-AI teams can outperform AI alone, suggesting promising directions for human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analysis: Implications for Legal Education and the Profession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reports the results of a study examining the ability of legal and non-legal Large Language Models to perform legal analysis using the Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion framework. LLMs were tested on legal reasoning tasks involving rule analysis and analogical reasoning. The results show that LLMs can conduct basic IRAC analysis, but are limited by brief responses lacking detail, an inability to commit to answers, false confidence, and hallucinations. The study compares legal and nonlegal LLMs, identifies shortcomings, and explores traits that may hinder their ability to think like a lawyer. It also discusses the implications for legal education and practice, highlighting the need for critical thinking skills in future lawyers and the potential pitfalls of overreliance on artificial intelligence AI resulting in a loss of logic, reasoning, and critical thinking skills.</description>

      <title>Teaching Language Models to Critique via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose $\texttt{CTRL}$, a framework for $\texttt{C}$ritic $\texttt{T}$raining via $\texttt{R}$einforcement $\texttt{L}$earning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with $\texttt{CTRL}$ significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Omni-DNA: A Unified Genomic Foundation Model for Cross-Modal and Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable generalizability across diverse tasks, yet genomic foundation models (GFMs) still require separate finetuning for each downstream application, creating significant overhead as model sizes grow. Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications. All the models are available through https://huggingface.co/collections/zehui127</description>

      <title>Efficient Image Restoration via Latent Consistency Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</description>

      <title>DC-VSR: Spatially and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution with Video Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) video from a low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Two in context learning tasks with complex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine two in context learning (ICL) tasks with mathematical functions in several train and test settings for transformer models. Our study generalizes work on linear functions by showing that small transformers, even models with attention layers only, can approximate arbitrary polynomial functions and hence continuous functions under certain conditions. Our models also can approximate previously unseen classes of polynomial functions, as well as the zeros of complex functions. Our models perform far better on this task than LLMs like GPT4 and involve complex reasoning when provided with suitable training data and methods. Our models also have important limitations; they fail to generalize outside of training distributions and so don't learn class forms of functions. We explain why this is so.</description>

      <title>Immersion for AI: Immersive Learning with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reflects upon what Immersion can mean from the perspective of an Artificial Intelligence (AI). Applying the lens of immersive learning theory, it seeks to understand whether this new perspective supports ways for AI participation in cognitive ecologies. By treating AI as a participant rather than a tool, it explores what other participants (humans and other AIs) need to consider in environments where AI can meaningfully engage and contribute to the cognitive ecology, and what the implications are for designing such learning environments. Drawing from the three conceptual dimensions of immersion - System, Narrative, and Agency - this work reinterprets AIs in immersive learning contexts. It outlines practical implications for designing learning environments where AIs are surrounded by external digital services, can interpret a narrative of origins, changes, and structural developments in data, and dynamically respond, making operational and tactical decisions that shape human-AI collaboration. Finally, this work suggests how these insights might influence the future of AI training, proposing that immersive learning theory can inform the development of AIs capable of evolving beyond static models. This paper paves the way for understanding AI as an immersive learner and participant in evolving human-AI cognitive ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

      <title>Elucidation of the Concept of Consciousness from the Theory of Non-Human Communication Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on elucidating the concept of consciousness from a relational and post-phenomenological theory of non-human communication agents (ANHC). Specifically, we explore the contributions of Thomas Metzinger s Self Model Theory, Katherine Hayles conceptualizations of non-conscious cognitive processes centered on knowledge processing phenomena shared between biological and technical systems and Lenore and Manuel Blum s theoretical perspective on computation, which defines consciousness as an emergent phenomenon of complex computational systems, arising from the appropriate organization of their inorganic materiality. Building on interactions with non-human cognitive agents, among other factors, the explainability of sociotechnical systems challenges the humanistic common sense of modern philosophy and science. This critical integration of various approaches ultimately questions other concepts associated with consciousness, such as autonomy, freedom, and mutual responsibility. The aim is to contribute to a necessary discussion for designing new frameworks of understanding that pave the way toward an ethical and pragmatic approach to addressing contemporary challenges in the design, regulation, and interaction with ANHC. Such frameworks, in turn, enable a more inclusive and relational understanding of agency in an interconnected world.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Exploration of ChatGPT's Ability to Support Problem Formulation Tasks for Mission Engineering and a Documentation of its Performance Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems engineering (SE) is evolving with the availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for a systems-of-systems perspective, formalized under the purview of mission engineering (ME) in the US Department of Defense. Formulating ME problems is challenging because they are open-ended exercises that involve translation of ill-defined problems into well-defined ones that are amenable for engineering development. It remains to be seen to which extent AI could assist problem formulation objectives. To that end, this paper explores the quality and consistency of multi-purpose Large Language Models (LLM) in supporting ME problem formulation tasks, specifically focusing on stakeholder identification. We identify a relevant reference problem, a NASA space mission design challenge, and document ChatGPT-3.5's ability to perform stakeholder identification tasks. We execute multiple parallel attempts and qualitatively evaluate LLM outputs, focusing on both their quality and variability. Our findings portray a nuanced picture. We find that the LLM performs well in identifying human-focused stakeholders but poorly in recognizing external systems and environmental factors, despite explicit efforts to account for these. Additionally, LLMs struggle with preserving the desired level of abstraction and exhibit a tendency to produce solution specific outputs that are inappropriate for problem formulation. More importantly, we document great variability among parallel threads, highlighting that LLM outputs should be used with caution, ideally by adopting a stochastic view of their abilities. Overall, our findings suggest that, while ChatGPT could reduce some expert workload, its lack of consistency and domain understanding may limit its reliability for problem formulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the order in which tokens are unmasked during masked diffusion models (MDMs) inference affects generative quality. We derive an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) that introduces a planner, responsible for selecting which tokens to unmask at each step. Our analysis suggests that alternative unmasking strategies can improve generative performance. Based on these insights, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that leverages pre-trained BERT or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and enables significant improvements across diverse domains including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).</description>

      <title>Code Simulation as a Proxy for High-order Tasks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Learning Approach to Linear Multivariate Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

      <description>arXiv:2502.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) image classification that enhances clinical interpretability while maintaining a streamlined, single-model, single-run training pipeline. Leveraging the CheXpert dataset and VisualCheXbert-derived labels, we incorporate hierarchical label groupings to capture clinically meaningful relationships between diagnoses. To achieve this, we designed a custom hierarchical binary cross-entropy (HBCE) loss function that enforces label dependencies using either fixed or data-driven penalty types. Our model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.903 on the test set. Additionally, we provide visual explanations and uncertainty estimations to further enhance model interpretability. All code, model configurations, and experiment details are made available.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address this challenge, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</description>

      <title>(GG) MoE vs. MLP on Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant efforts have been directed toward adapting modern neural network architectures for tabular data. However, despite their larger number of parameters and longer training and inference times, these models often fail to consistently outperform vanilla multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Moreover, MLP-based ensembles have recently demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to advanced deep learning methods. Therefore, rather than focusing on building deeper and more complex deep learning models, we propose investigating whether MLP neural networks can be replaced with more efficient architectures without sacrificing performance. In this paper, we first introduce GG MoE, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with a Gumbel-Softmax gating function. We then demonstrate that GG MoE with an embedding layer achieves the highest performance across $38$ datasets compared to standard MoE and MLP models. Finally, we show that both MoE and GG MoE utilize significantly fewer parameters than MLPs, making them a promising alternative for scaling and ensemble methods.</description>

Abstract: The IoT facilitates a connected, intelligent, and sustainable society; therefore, it is imperative to protect the IoT ecosystem. The IoT-based 5G and 6G will leverage the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) more to pave the way for autonomous and collaborative secure IoT networks. Zero-touch, zero-trust IoT security with AI and machine learning (ML) enablement frameworks offers a powerful approach to securing the expanding landscape of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This paper presents a novel framework based on the integration of Zero Trust, Zero Touch, and AI/ML powered for the detection, mitigation, and prevention of DDoS attacks in modern IoT ecosystems. The focus will be on the new integrated framework by establishing zero trust for all IoT traffic, fixed and mobile 5G/6G IoT network traffic, and data security (quarantine-zero touch and dynamic policy enforcement). We perform a comparative analysis of five machine learning models, namely, XGBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Native Bayes, by comparing these models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Results show that the best performance in detecting and mitigating different DDoS vectors comes from the ensemble-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain a significant threat in the digital age, yet organizations lack effective methods to tackle phishing attacks without leaking sensitive information. Phish bowl initiatives are a vital part of cybersecurity efforts against these attacks. However, traditional phish bowls require manual anonymization and are often limited to internal use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AdaPhish, an AI-powered phish bowl platform that automatically anonymizes and analyzes phishing emails using large language models (LLMs) and vector databases. AdaPhish achieves real-time detection and adaptation to new phishing tactics while enabling long-term tracking of phishing trends. Through automated reporting, adaptive analysis, and real-time alerts, AdaPhish presents a scalable, collaborative solution for phishing detection and cybersecurity education.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively over both textual and visual inputs, but they tend to hallucinate syntactically coherent yet visually ungrounded contents. In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits rankings throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss -- visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation -- semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information -- visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decided still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by abount 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.</description>

      <title>REALEDIT: Reddit Edits As a Large-scale Empirical Dataset for Image Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.</description>

      <title>Gompertz Linear Units: Leveraging Asymmetry for Enhanced Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</description>

      <title>A Study in Dataset Distillation for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation is the concept of condensing large datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While previous research has primarily focused on image classification, its application to image Super-Resolution (SR) remains underexplored. This exploratory work studies multiple dataset distillation techniques applied to SR, including pixel- and latent-space approaches under different aspects. Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.</description>

      <title>Energy &amp; Force Regression on DFT Trajectories is Not Enough for Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials (MLIPs) enable accelerated simulations for materials discovery. However, current research efforts fail to impactfully utilize MLIPs due to: 1. Overreliance on Density Functional Theory (DFT) for MLIP training data creation; 2. MLIPs' inability to reliably and accurately perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for diverse materials; 3. Limited understanding of MLIPs' underlying capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we aargue that MLIP research efforts should prioritize: 1. Employing more accurate simulation methods for large-scale MLIP training data creation (e.g. Coupled Cluster Theory) that cover a wide range of materials design spaces; 2. Creating MLIP metrology tools that leverage large-scale benchmarking, visualization, and interpretability analyses to provide a deeper understanding of MLIPs' inner workings; 3. Developing computationally efficient MLIPs to execute MD simulations that accurately model a broad set of materials properties. Together, these interdisciplinary research directions can help further the real-world application of MLIPs to accurately model complex materials at device scale.</description>

      <title>Unrealized Expectations: Comparing AI Methods vs Classical Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI methods, such as generative models and reinforcement learning, have recently been applied to combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, especially NP-hard ones. This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers.
  We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan &amp; Efthymiou (2015).</description>

      <title>Advancing Reasoning in Large Language Models: Promising Methods and Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, their ability to perform complex reasoning-spanning logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense inference, and multi-step reasoning-often falls short of human expectations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks. By synthesizing recent advancements, this survey aims to provide insights into promising directions for future research and practical applications of reasoning-augmented LLMs.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews object detection methods for finding small objects from remote sensing imagery and provides an empirical evaluation of four state-of-the-art methods to gain insights into method performance and technical challenges. In particular, we use car detection from urban satellite images and bee box detection from satellite images of agricultural lands as application scenarios. Drawing from the existing surveys and literature, we identify several top-performing methods for the empirical study. Public, high-resolution satellite image datasets are used in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Reflection-Window Decoding: Text Generation with Selective Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear and (blind) non-linear inverse problems without requiring additional model training or modifications. For instance, in ImageNet non-linear deblurring, our model achieves an FID score of 34.31, significantly improving over the best pretrained-method baseline (FID 78.07). We will make the code available in a future update.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of predicting an outcome using a short text for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama.
  We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs).
  In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLM Alignment as Retriever Optimization: An Information Retrieval Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <title>Aggregate and conquer: detecting and steering LLM concepts by combining nonlinear predictors over multiple layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trained Large Language Model (LLM) contains much of human knowledge. Yet, it is difficult to gauge the extent or accuracy of that knowledge, as LLMs do not always ``know what they know'' and may even be actively misleading. In this work, we give a general method for detecting semantic concepts in the internal activations of LLMs. Furthermore, we show that our methodology can be easily adapted to steer LLMs toward desirable outputs. Our innovations are the following: (1) we use a nonlinear feature learning method to identify important linear directions for predicting concepts from each layer; (2) we aggregate features across layers to build powerful concept detectors and steering mechanisms. We showcase the power of our approach by attaining state-of-the-art results for detecting hallucinations, harmfulness, toxicity, and untruthful content on seven benchmarks. We highlight the generality of our approach by steering LLMs towards new concepts that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously considered in the literature, including: semantic disambiguation, human languages, programming languages, hallucinated responses, science subjects, poetic/Shakespearean English, and even multiple concepts simultaneously. Moreover, our method can steer concepts with numerical attributes such as product reviews. We provide our code (including a simple API for our methods) at https://github.com/dmbeaglehole/neural_controllers .</description>

      <title>MultiQ&amp;A: An Analysis in Measuring Robustness via Automated Crowdsourcing of Question Perturbations and Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One critical challenge in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from their propensity to hallucinate in generated responses. To address this, we propose MultiQ&amp;A, a systematic approach for evaluating the robustness and consistency of LLM-generated answers. We demonstrate MultiQ&amp;A's ability to crowdsource question perturbations and their respective answers through independent LLM agents at scale. Our experiments culminated in the examination of 1.9 million question perturbations and 2.3 million answers. Furthermore, MultiQ&amp;A shows that ensembled LLMs, such as gpt-3.5-turbo, remain relatively robust and consistent under perturbations. MultiQ&amp;A provides clarity in the response generation space, offering an effective method for inspecting disagreements and variability. Therefore, our system offers a potential framework for institutional LLM adoption with the ability to measure confidence, consistency, and the quantification of hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Boosting Knowledge Graph-based Recommendations through Confidence-Aware Augmentation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based recommendations have gained significant attention due to their ability to leverage rich semantic relationships. However, constructing and maintaining Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is resource-intensive, and the accuracy of KGs can suffer from noisy, outdated, or irrelevant triplets. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising way to improve the quality and relevance of KGs for recommendation tasks. Despite this, integrating LLMs into KG-based systems presents challenges, such as efficiently augmenting KGs, addressing hallucinations, and developing effective joint learning methods. In this paper, we propose the Confidence-aware KG-based Recommendation Framework with LLM Augmentation (CKG-LLMA), a novel framework that combines KGs and LLMs for recommendation task. The framework includes: (1) an LLM-based subgraph augmenter for enriching KGs with high-quality information, (2) a confidence-aware message propagation mechanism to filter noisy triplets, and (3) a dual-view contrastive learning method to integrate user-item interactions and KG data. Additionally, we employ a confidence-aware explanation generation process to guide LLMs in producing realistic explanations for recommendations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CKG-LLMA across multiple public datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Generating Expressive Quadruped Behaviors via Language-Guided Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However, determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries, outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional preference learning approaches.

      <title>MD-BERT: Action Recognition in Dark Videos via Dynamic Multi-Stream Fusion and Temporal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

      <title>Action-Free Reasoning for Policy Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end imitation learning offers a promising approach for training robot policies. However, generalizing to new settings remains a significant challenge. Although large-scale robot demonstration datasets have shown potential for inducing generalization, they are resource-intensive to scale. In contrast, human video data is abundant and diverse, presenting an attractive alternative. Yet, these human-video datasets lack action labels, complicating their use in imitation learning. Existing methods attempt to extract grounded action representations (e.g., hand poses), but resulting policies struggle to bridge the embodiment gap between human and robot actions. We propose an alternative approach: leveraging language-based reasoning from human videos-essential for guiding robot actions-to train generalizable robot policies. Building on recent advances in reasoning-based policy architectures, we introduce Reasoning through Action-free Data (RAD). RAD learns from both robot demonstration data (with reasoning and action labels) and action-free human video data (with only reasoning labels). The robot data teaches the model to map reasoning to low-level actions, while the action-free data enhances reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we will release a new dataset of 3,377 human-hand demonstrations with reasoning annotations compatible with the Bridge V2 benchmark and aimed at facilitating future research on reasoning-driven robot learning. Our experiments show that RAD enables effective transfer across the embodiment gap, allowing robots to perform tasks seen only in action-free data. Furthermore, scaling up action-free reasoning data significantly improves policy performance and generalization to novel tasks. These results highlight the promise of reasoning-driven learning from action-free datasets for advancing generalizable robot control. Project page: https://rad-generalization.github.io</description>

      <title>Multiple Invertible and Partial-Equivariant Function for Latent Vector Transformation to Enhance Disentanglement in VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentanglement learning is a core issue for understanding and re-using trained information in Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), and effective inductive bias has been reported as a key factor. However, the actual implementation of such bias is still vague. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Multiple Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (MIPE-transformation), to inject inductive bias by 1) guaranteeing the invertibility of latent-to-latent vector transformation while preserving a certain portion of equivariance of input-to-latent vector transformation, called Invertible and partial-equivariant transformation (IPE-transformation), 2) extending the form of prior and posterior in VAE frameworks to an unrestricted form through a learnable conversion to an approximated exponential family, called Exponential Family conversion (EF-conversion), and 3) integrating multiple units of IPE-transformation and EF-conversion, and their training. In experiments on 3D Cars, 3D Shapes, and dSprites datasets, MIPE-transformation improves the disentanglement performance of state-of-the-art VAEs.</description>

      <title>Principal Curvatures Estimation with Applications to Single Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly growing field of single-cell transcriptomic sequencing (scRNAseq) presents challenges for data analysis due to its massive datasets. A common method in manifold learning consists in hypothesizing that datasets lie on a lower dimensional manifold. This allows to study the geometry of point clouds by extracting meaningful descriptors like curvature. In this work, we will present Adaptive Local PCA (AdaL-PCA), a data-driven method for accurately estimating various notions of intrinsic curvature on data manifolds, in particular principal curvatures for surfaces. The model relies on local PCA to estimate the tangent spaces. The evaluation of AdaL-PCA on sampled surfaces shows state-of-the-art results. Combined with a PHATE embedding, the model applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data allows us to identify key variations in the cellular differentiation.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Robust Framework for Skill-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, resulting in unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose Prioritized Refinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates exploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them with offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to learn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our method ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in long-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data.</description>

      <title>A Retrospective Systematic Study on Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer-assisted Ultrasound Screening for Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, early screening for HCC using ultrasound suffers from insufficient sensitivity and is highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists for interpretation. Leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, this study proposes an innovative Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer) model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance the accuracy of HCC diagnosis in ultrasound screening. The HSQformer leverages sparse latent space representations to capture hierarchical details at various granularities without the need for complex adjustments, and adopts a modular, plug-and-play design philosophy, ensuring the model's versatility and ease of use. The HSQformer's performance was rigorously tested across three distinct clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient testing. In each of these settings, it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer. Notably, the HSQformer even matched the diagnostic capabilities of senior radiologists and comprehensively surpassed those of junior radiologists. The experimental results from this study strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of AI-assisted tools in HCC screening.

      <title>ExpProof : Operationalizing Explanations for Confidential Models with ZKPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In principle, explanations are intended as a way to increase trust in machine learning models and are often obligated by regulations. However, many circumstances where these are demanded are adversarial in nature, meaning the involved parties have misaligned interests and are incentivized to manipulate explanations for their purpose. As a result, explainability methods fail to be operational in such settings despite the demand \cite{bordt2022post}. In this paper, we take a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial scenarios with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic primitive. Specifically we explore ZKP-amenable versions of the popular explainability algorithm LIME and evaluate their performance on Neural Networks and Random Forests.</description>

      <title>It's All in The [MASK]: Simple Instruction-Tuning Enables BERT-like Masked Language Models As Generative Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While encoder-only models such as BERT and ModernBERT are ubiquitous in real-world NLP applications, their conventional reliance on task-specific classification heads can limit their applicability compared to decoder-based large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce ModernBERT-Large-Instruct, a 0.4B-parameter encoder model that leverages its masked language modelling (MLM) head for generative classification. Our approach employs an intentionally simple training loop and inference mechanism that requires no heavy pre-processing, heavily engineered prompting, or architectural modifications. ModernBERT-Large-Instruct exhibits strong zero-shot performance on both classification and knowledge-based tasks, outperforming similarly sized LLMs on MMLU and achieving 93% of Llama3-1B's MMLU performance with 60% less parameters. We also demonstrate that, when fine-tuned, the generative approach using the MLM head matches or even surpasses traditional classification-head methods across diverse NLU tasks.This capability emerges specifically in models trained on contemporary, diverse data mixes, with models trained on lower volume, less-diverse data yielding considerably weaker performance. Although preliminary, these results demonstrate the potential of using the original generative masked language modelling head over traditional task-specific heads for downstream tasks. Our work suggests that further exploration into this area is warranted, highlighting many avenues for future improvements.</description>

      <title>SoK: Benchmarking Poisoning Attacks and Defenses in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but its decentralized nature exposes it to client-side data poisoning attacks (DPAs) and model poisoning attacks (MPAs) that degrade global model performance. While numerous proposed defenses claim substantial effectiveness, their evaluation is typically done in isolation with limited attack strategies, raising concerns about their validity. Additionally, existing studies overlook the mutual effectiveness of defenses against both DPAs and MPAs, causing fragmentation in this field. This paper aims to provide a unified benchmark and analysis of defenses against DPAs and MPAs, clarifying the distinction between these two similar but slightly distinct domains. We present a systematic taxonomy of poisoning attacks and defense strategies, outlining their design, strengths, and limitations. Then, a unified comparative evaluation across FL algorithms and data heterogeneity is conducted to validate their individual and mutual effectiveness and derive key insights for design principles and future research. Along with the analysis, we frame our work to a unified benchmark, FLPoison, with high modularity and scalability to evaluate 15 representative poisoning attacks and 17 defense strategies, facilitating future research in this domain.

      <title>Understanding and Supporting Formal Email Exchange by Answering AI-Generated Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replying to formal emails is time-consuming and cognitively demanding, as it requires polite phrasing and ensuring an adequate response to the sender's demands. Although systems with Large Language Models (LLM) were designed to simplify the email replying process, users still needed to provide detailed prompts to obtain the expected output. Therefore, we proposed and evaluated an LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email. We developed a prototype system, ResQ, and conducted controlled and field experiments with 12 and 8 participants. Our results demonstrated that QA-based approach improves the efficiency of replying to emails and reduces workload while maintaining email quality compared to a conventional prompt-based approach that requires users to craft appropriate prompts to obtain email drafts. We discuss how QA-based approach influences the email reply process and interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with using a QA-based approach in AI-mediated communication.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Multi-Robot Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), enabling enhanced communication, task planning, and human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source Github repository.</description>

      <title>Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications. Recently, there were attempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval systems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs which are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a training framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs. Syntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we synthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries using chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the synthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained with a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly in the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We propose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM preferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating excessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from various domains in nDCG@$K$.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis, a popular subtask of Natural Language Processing, employs computational methods to extract sentiment, opinions, and other subjective aspects from linguistic data. Given its crucial role in understanding human sentiment, research in sentiment analysis has witnessed significant growth in the recent years. However, the majority of approaches are aimed at the English language, and research towards Arabic sentiment analysis remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive and contemporary survey of Arabic Sentiment Analysis, identifies the challenges and limitations of existing literature in this field and presents avenues for future research. We present a systematic review of Arabic sentiment analysis methods, focusing specifically on research utilizing deep learning. We then situate Arabic Sentiment Analysis within the broader context, highlighting research gaps in Arabic sentiment analysis as compared to general sentiment analysis. Finally, we outline the main challenges and promising future directions for research in Arabic sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Natural Language Understanding for LLMs via Large-Scale Instruction Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality, large-scale instructions are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs), however, there is a severe shortage of instruction in the field of natural language understanding (NLU). Previous works on constructing NLU instructions mainly focus on information extraction (IE), neglecting tasks such as machine reading comprehension, question answering, and text classification. Furthermore, the lack of diversity in the data has led to a decreased generalization ability of trained LLMs in other NLU tasks and a noticeable decline in the fundamental model's general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Hum, a large-scale, high-quality synthetic instruction corpus for NLU tasks, designed to enhance the NLU capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, Hum includes IE (either close IE or open IE), machine reading comprehension, text classification, and instruction generalist tasks, thereby enriching task diversity. Additionally, we introduce a human-LLMs collaborative mechanism to synthesize instructions, which enriches instruction diversity by incorporating guidelines, preference rules, and format variants. We conduct extensive experiments on 5 NLU tasks and 28 general capability evaluation datasets for LLMs. Experimental results show that Hum enhances the NLU capabilities of six LLMs by an average of 3.1\%, with no significant decline observed in other general capabilities.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Better Decision Boundaries for Long-Tailed Object Detection via Category Information Amount</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In object detection, the instance count is typically used to define whether a dataset exhibits a long-tail distribution, implicitly assuming that models will underperform on categories with fewer instances. This assumption has led to extensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance counts. However, models still exhibit category bias even in datasets where instance counts are relatively balanced, clearly indicating that instance count alone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the concept and measurement of category information amount. We observe a significant negative correlation between category information amount and accuracy, suggesting that category information amount more accurately reflects the learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose Information Amount-Guided Angular Margin (IGAM) Loss. The core idea of IGAM is to dynamically adjust the decision space of each category based on its information amount, thereby reducing category bias in long-tail datasets. IGAM Loss not only performs well on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0 and COCO-LT but also shows significant improvement for underrepresented categories in the non-long-tailed dataset Pascal VOC. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the potential of category information amount as a tool and the generality of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Rank Also Matters: Hierarchical Configuration for Mixture of Adapter Experts in LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks, accompanied by a continuous increase in their parameter size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Recent studies have integrated LoRA with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, leveraging multiple adapter experts and gating mechanisms to further improve fine-tuning performance. However, existing approaches primarily focus on adjusting the allocations of adapter experts per layer to optimize the introduced trainable parameter size, while neglecting a critical factor of adapters' rank. To this end, we propose a hierarchical scheme for expert allocation and rank configuration, HILO, which dynamically adjusts the number and rank of adapter experts across layers, matching the varying representational complexity of model layers in adapter-granularity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that HILO outperforms existing methods in accuracy while introducing fewer trainable parameters, providing an efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.</description>

      <title>UniForm: A Unified Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a natural multimodal content, audible video delivers an immersive sensory experience. Consequently, audio-video generation systems have substantial potential. However, existing diffusion-based studies mainly employ relatively independent modules for generating each modality, which lack exploration of shared-weight generative modules. This approach may under-use the intrinsic correlations between audio and visual modalities, potentially resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose UniForm, a unified diffusion transformer designed to enhance cross-modal consistency. By concatenating auditory and visual information, UniForm learns to generate audio and video simultaneously within a unified latent space, facilitating the creation of high-quality and well-aligned audio-visual pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in joint audio-video generation, audio-guided video generation, and video-guided audio generation tasks. Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Experiments with Large Language Models on Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Closed-Source Simulation Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly helpful in text generation, even writing code in programming languages based on user prompts written in natural language. They are even applied to generate simulation models for multibody systems from natural language. Research results suggest that LLMs surpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have been trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for closed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their ideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones. LLMs can hallucinate for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to define a task with freedom and variability in its goal state. A robot could use this to observe the execution of a task and target a different goal from the observed one; a goal that is still compatible with the task description but would be easier for the robot to execute. We define the model of an environment state and an environment variation, and present experiments on how to interactively create the variation from a single task demonstration and how to use this variation to create an execution plan for bringing any environment into the goal state.</description>

      <title>DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</description>

      <title>MAQInstruct: Instruction-based Unified Event Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting event relations that deviate from known schemas has proven challenging for previous methods based on multi-class classification, MASK prediction, or prototype matching. Recent advancements in large language models have shown impressive performance through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, in the task of event relation extraction, instruction-based methods face several challenges: there are a vast number of inference samples, and the relations between events are non-sequential. To tackle these challenges, we present an improved instruction-based event relation extraction framework named MAQInstruct. Firstly, we transform the task from extracting event relations using given event-event instructions to selecting events using given event-relation instructions, which reduces the number of samples required for inference. Then, by incorporating a bipartite matching loss, we reduce the dependency of the instruction-based method on the generation sequence. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAQInstruct significantly improves the performance of event relation extraction across multiple LLMs.</description>

      <title>Improving the Perturbation-Based Explanation of Deepfake Detectors Through the Use of Adversarially-Generated Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the idea of using adversarially-generated samples of the input images that were classified as deepfakes by a detector, to form perturbation masks for inferring the importance of different input features and produce visual explanations. We generate these samples based on Natural Evolution Strategies, aiming to flip the original deepfake detector's decision and classify these samples as real. We apply this idea to four perturbation-based explanation methods (LIME, SHAP, SOBOL and RISE) and evaluate the performance of the resulting modified methods using a SOTA deepfake detection model, a benchmarking dataset (FaceForensics++) and a corresponding explanation evaluation framework. Our quantitative assessments document the mostly positive contribution of the proposed perturbation approach in the performance of explanation methods. Our qualitative analysis shows the capacity of the modified explanation methods to demarcate the manipulated image regions more accurately, and thus to provide more useful explanations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Design using a Progressive Widening Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem and to the quantum hardware. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. It introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits have up to three times fewer CNOT gates.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present synthetic data generation framework for flood hazard detection system. For high fidelity and quality, we characterize several real-world properties into virtual world and simulate the flood situation by controlling them. For the sake of efficiency, recent generative models in image-to-3D and urban city synthesis are leveraged to easily composite flood environments so that we avoid data bias due to the hand-crafted manner. Based on our framework, we build the flood synthetic dataset with 5 levels, dubbed MultiFloodSynth which contains rich annotation types like normal map, segmentation, 3D bounding box for a variety of downstream task. In experiments, our dataset demonstrate the enhanced performance of flood hazard detection with on-par realism compared with real dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Music Emotion Recognition across Dimensional and Categorical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Music Emotion Recognition (MER) comes from the fact that emotion labels can be heterogeneous across datasets with regard to the emotion representation, including categorical (e.g., happy, sad) versus dimensional labels (e.g., valence-arousal). In this paper, we present a unified multitask learning framework that combines these two types of labels and is thus able to be trained on multiple datasets. This framework uses an effective input representation that combines musical features (i.e., key and chords) and MERT embeddings. Moreover, knowledge distillation is employed to transfer the knowledge of teacher models trained on individual datasets to a student model, enhancing its ability to generalize across multiple tasks. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic. According to our experimental results, the inclusion of musical features, multitask learning, and knowledge distillation significantly enhances performance. In particular, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition on the MTG-Jamendo dataset. Our work makes a significant contribution to MER by allowing the combination of categorical and dimensional emotion labels in one unified framework, thus enabling training across datasets.</description>

      <title>PGB: One-Shot Pruning for BERT via Weight Grouping and Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pretrained language models such as BERT suffer from slow inference and high memory usage, due to their huge size. Recent approaches to compressing BERT rely on iterative pruning and knowledge distillation, which, however, are often too complicated and computationally intensive. This paper proposes a novel semi-structured one-shot pruning method for BERT, called $\textit{Permutation and Grouping for BERT}$ (PGB), which achieves high compression efficiency and sparsity while preserving accuracy. To this end, PGB identifies important groups of individual weights by permutation and prunes all other weights as a structure in both multi-head attention and feed-forward layers. Furthermore, if no important group is formed in a particular layer, PGB drops the entire layer to produce an even more compact model. Our experimental results on BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ demonstrate that PGB outperforms the state-of-the-art structured pruning methods in terms of computational cost and accuracy preservation.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Guided, Hybrid Prompt Learning for Generalization in Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) approaches are designed for a specific KG, such as Wikidata, DBpedia or Freebase. Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying graph schema, topology and assertions, most KGQA systems cannot be transferred to unseen Knowledge Graphs (KGs) without resource-intensive training data. We present OntoSCPrompt, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based KGQA approach with a two-stage architecture that separates semantic parsing from KG-dependent interactions. OntoSCPrompt first generates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT, ASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with KG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we present an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG ontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and continuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies to ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both stages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as SOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ, WebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well to unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG Code: \href{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}{https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt}</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Counter Categories and Ratings in PvP Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In competitive games, strength ratings like Elo are widely used to quantify player skill and support matchmaking by accounting for skill disparities better than simple win rate statistics. However, scalar ratings cannot handle complex intransitive relationships, such as counter strategies seen in Rock-Paper-Scissors. To address this, recent work introduced Neural Rating Table and Neural Counter Table, which combine scalar ratings with discrete counter categories to model intransitivity. While effective, these methods rely on neural network training and cannot perform real-time updates. In this paper, we propose an online update algorithm that extends Elo principles to incorporate real-time learning of counter categories. Our method dynamically adjusts both ratings and counter relationships after each match, preserving the explainability of scalar ratings while addressing intransitivity. Experiments on zero-sum competitive games demonstrate its practicality, particularly in scenarios without complex team compositions.</description>

      <title>Automating a Complete Software Test Process Using LLMs: An Automotive Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle API testing verifies whether the interactions between a vehicle's internal systems and external applications meet expectations, ensuring that users can access and control various vehicle functions and data. However, this task is inherently complex, requiring the alignment and coordination of API systems, communication protocols, and even vehicle simulation systems to develop valid test cases. In practical industrial scenarios, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and interdependencies across various documents and system specifications pose significant challenges. This paper presents a system designed for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and segmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow. Experiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively automates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can efficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable for complete automation in similar industrial contexts.</description>

      <title>Generalize Drug Response Prediction by Latent Independent Projection for Asymmetric Constrained Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of drug responses remains a formidable challenge, particularly at the single-cell level and in clinical treatment contexts. Some studies employ transfer learning techniques to predict drug responses in individual cells and patients, but they require access to target-domain data during training, which is often unavailable or only obtainable in future. In this study, we propose a novel domain generalization framework, termed panCancerDR, to address this challenge. We conceptualize each cancer type as a distinct source domain, with its cell lines serving as domain-specific samples. Our primary objective is to extract domain-invariant features from the expression profiles of cell lines across diverse cancer types, thereby generalize the predictive capacity to out-of-distribution samples. To enhance robustness, we introduce a latent independence projection (LIP) module that encourages the encoder to extract informative yet non-redundant features. Also, we propose an asymmetric adaptive clustering constraint, which clusters drug-sensitive samples into a compact group while drives resistant samples dispersed across separate clusters in the latent space. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that panCancerDR effectively learns task-relevant features from diverse source domains, and achieves accurate predictions of drug response for unseen cancer type during training. Furthermore, when evaluated on single-cell and patient-level prediction tasks, our model-trained solely on in vitro cell line data without access to target-domain information-consistently outperforms and matched current state-of-the-art methods. These findings highlights the potential of our method for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reasoning with Guidelines to Elicit and Utilize Knowledge for Enhancing Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training safe LLMs is one of the most critical research challenge. However, the commonly used method, Refusal Training (RT), struggles to generalize against various OOD jailbreaking attacks. Many safety training methods have been proposed to address this issue. While they offer valuable insights, we aim to complement this line of research by investigating whether OOD attacks truly exceed the capability of RT model. Conducting evaluation with BoN, we observe significant improvements on generalization as N increases. This underscores that the model possesses sufficient safety-related latent knowledge, but RT fails to consistently elicit this knowledge when addressing OOD attacks. Further analysis based on domain adaptation reveals that training with direct refusal causes model to rely on superficial shortcuts, resulting in learning of non-robust representation mappings. Based on our findings, we propose training model to perform safety reasoning for each query. Reasoning supervision encourages model to perform more computations, explicitly eliciting and using latent knowledge through reasoning. To achieve this, we synthesize reasoning supervision based on pre-guidelines, training the model to reason in alignment with them, thereby effectively eliciting and utilizing latent knowledge from diverse perspectives. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves generalization performance against OOD attacks.</description>

      <title>Probe-Free Low-Rank Activation Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) can produce texts that appear accurate and coherent but contain untruthful or toxic content. Inference-time interventions that edit the hidden activations have shown promising results in steering the LMs towards desirable generations. Existing activation intervention methods often comprise an activation probe to detect undesirable generation, triggering the activation modification to steer subsequent generation. This paper proposes a probe-free intervention method FLORAIN for all attention heads in a specific activation layer. It eliminates the need to train classifiers for probing purposes. The intervention function is parametrized by a sample-wise nonlinear low-rank mapping, which is trained by minimizing the distance between the modified activations and their projection onto the manifold of desirable content. Under specific constructions of the manifold and projection distance, we show that the intervention strategy can be computed efficiently by solving a smooth optimization problem. The empirical results, benchmarked on multiple base models, demonstrate that FLORAIN consistently outperforms several baseline methods in enhancing model truthfulness and quality across generation and multiple-choice tasks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Large Language Model Capabilities on Closed-Book QA Tasks Using Only Information Available Prior to Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report from OpenAI suggests that model performance on specific tasks can be predicted prior to training, though methodologies remain unspecified. This approach is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring data alignment with target tasks. To achieve this vision, we focus on predicting performance on Closed-book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks, which are closely tied to pre-training data and knowledge retention. We address three major challenges: 1) mastering the entire pre-training process, especially data construction; 2) evaluating a model's knowledge retention; and 3) predicting task-specific knowledge retention using only information available prior to training. To tackle these challenges, we pre-train three large language models (i.e., 1.6B, 7B, and 13B) using 560k dollars and 520k GPU hours. We analyze the pre-training data with knowledge triples and assess knowledge retention using established methods. Additionally, we introduce the SMI metric, an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the relationship between pre-training data, model size, and task-specific knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal a strong linear correlation ($\text{R}^2 &gt; 0.84$) between the SMI metric and the model's accuracy on CBQA tasks across models of varying sizes (i.e., 1.1B, 1.6B, 7B, and 13B). The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/yuhui1038/SMI.</description>

      <title>Automatic quantification of breast cancer biomarkers from multiple 18F-FDG PET image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become a standard clinical practice for tumor downsizing in breast cancer with 18F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Our work aims to leverage PET imaging for the segmentation of breast lesions. The focus is on developing an automated system that accurately segments primary tumor regions and extracts key biomarkers from these areas to provide insights into the evolution of breast cancer following the first course of NAC. 243 baseline 18F-FDG PET scans (PET_Bl) and 180 follow-up 18F-FDG PET scans (PET_Fu) were acquired before and after the first course of NAC, respectively. Firstly, a deep learning-based breast tumor segmentation method was developed. The optimal baseline model (model trained on baseline exams) was fine-tuned on 15 follow-up exams and adapted using active learning to segment tumor areas in PET_Fu. The pipeline computes biomarkers such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) to evaluate tumor evolution between PET_Fu and PET_Bl. Quality control measures were employed to exclude aberrant outliers. The nnUNet deep learning model outperformed in tumor segmentation on PET_Bl, achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.89 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 3.52 mm. After fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a DSC of 0.78 and a HD of 4.95 mm on PET_Fu exams. Biomarkers analysis revealed very strong correlations whatever the biomarker between manually segmented and automatically predicted regions. The significant average decrease of SUVmax, MTV and TLG were 5.22, 11.79 cm3 and 19.23 cm3, respectively. The presented approach demonstrates an automated system for breast tumor segmentation from 18F-FDG PET. Thanks to the extracted biomarkers, our method enables the automatic assessment of cancer progression.</description>

      <title>LLMs to Support a Domain Specific Knowledge Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a custom approach to developing a domain specific knowledge assistant for sustainability reporting using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In this domain, there is no publicly available question-answer dataset, which has impeded the development of a high-quality chatbot to support companies with IFRS reporting. The two key contributions of this project therefore are:
  (1) A high-quality synthetic question-answer (QA) dataset based on IFRS sustainability standards, created using a novel generation and evaluation pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This comprises 1,063 diverse QA pairs that address a wide spectrum of potential user queries in sustainability reporting. Various LLM-based techniques are employed to create the dataset, including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A custom evaluation framework is developed to assess question and answer quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness, relevance, and domain specificity. The dataset averages a score range of 8.16 out of 10 on these metrics.
  (2) Two architectures for question-answering in the sustainability reporting domain - a RAG pipeline and a fully LLM-based pipeline. The architectures are developed by experimenting, fine-tuning, and training on the QA dataset. The final pipelines feature an LLM fine-tuned on domain specific data and an industry classification component to improve the handling of complex queries. The RAG architecture achieves an accuracy of 85.32% on single-industry and 72.15% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, outperforming the baseline approach by 4.67 and 19.21 percentage points, respectively. The LLM-based pipeline achieves an accuracy of 93.45% on single-industry and 80.30% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, an improvement of 12.80 and 27.36 percentage points over the baseline, respectively.</description>

      <title>Efficient Few-Shot Continual Learning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Ancient Greek Technology: An Immersive Learning Use Case Described Using a Co-Intelligent Custom ChatGPT Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving consistency in immersive learning case descriptions is essential but challenging due to variations in research focus, methodology, and researchers' background. We address these challenges by leveraging the Immersive Learning Case Sheet (ILCS), a methodological instrument to standardize case descriptions, that we applied to an immersive learning case on ancient Greek technology in VRChat. Research team members had differing levels of familiarity with the ILCS and the case content, so we developed a custom ChatGPT assistant to facilitate consistent terminology and process alignment across the team. This paper constitutes an example of how structured case reports can be a novel contribution to immersive learning literature. Our findings demonstrate how the ILCS supports structured reflection and interpretation of the case. Further we report that the use of a ChatGPT assistant significantly sup-ports the coherence and quality of the team members development of the final ILCS. This exposes the potential of employing AI-driven tools to enhance collaboration and standardization of research practices in qualitative educational research. However, we also discuss the limitations and challenges, including reliance on AI for interpretive tasks and managing varied levels of expertise within the team. This study thus provides insights into the practical application of AI in standardizing immersive learning research processes.</description>

      <title>Llasa: Scaling Train-Time and Inference-Time Compute for Llama-based Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Datasets for Machine Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs using PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical processes can be expressed through partial differential equations (PDEs). Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found on https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs.</description>

      <title>UltraIF: Advancing Instruction Following from the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF.</description>

      <title>Archetypal Analysis for Binary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) is a matrix decomposition method that identifies distinct patterns using convex combinations of the data points denoted archetypes with each data point in turn reconstructed as convex combinations of the archetypes. AA thereby forms a polytope representing trade-offs of the distinct aspects in the data. Most existing methods for AA are designed for continuous data and do not exploit the structure of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose two new optimization frameworks for archetypal analysis for binary data. i) A second order approximation of the AA likelihood based on the Bernoulli distribution with efficient closed-form updates using an active set procedure for learning the convex combinations defining the archetypes, and a sequential minimal optimization strategy for learning the observation specific reconstructions. ii) A Bernoulli likelihood based version of the principal convex hull analysis (PCHA) algorithm originally developed for least squares optimization. We compare these approaches with the only existing binary AA procedure relying on multiplicative updates and demonstrate their superiority on both synthetic and real binary data. Notably, the proposed optimization frameworks for AA can easily be extended to other data distributions providing generic efficient optimization frameworks for AA based on tailored likelihood functions reflecting the underlying data distribution.</description>

      <title>The Best Instruction-Tuning Data are Those That Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training.
  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a tool for analyzing .NET CLR event logs based on a novel method inspired by Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach. Our research addresses the growing need for effective monitoring and optimization of software systems through detailed event log analysis. We utilize a BERT-based architecture with an enhanced tokenization process customized to event logs. The tool, developed using Python, its libraries, and an SQLite database, allows both conducting experiments for academic purposes and efficiently solving industry-emerging tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in compressing event sequences, detecting recurring patterns, and identifying anomalies. The trained model shows promising results, with a high accuracy rate in anomaly detection, which demonstrates the potential of NLP methods to improve the reliability and stability of software systems.</description>

      <title>Dark Distillation: Backdooring Distilled Datasets without Accessing Raw Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) enhances training efficiency and reduces bandwidth by condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic ones. It enables models to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the raw full dataset and has become a widely adopted method for data sharing. However, security concerns in DD remain underexplored. Existing studies typically assume that malicious behavior originates from dataset owners during the initial distillation process, where backdoors are injected into raw datasets. In contrast, this work is the first to address a more realistic and concerning threat: attackers may intercept the dataset distribution process, inject backdoors into the distilled datasets, and redistribute them to users. While distilled datasets were previously considered resistant to backdoor attacks, we demonstrate that they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Furthermore, we show that attackers do not even require access to any raw data to inject the backdoors successfully. Specifically, our approach reconstructs conceptual archetypes for each class from the model trained on the distilled dataset. Backdoors are then injected into these archetypes to update the distilled dataset. Moreover, we ensure the updated dataset not only retains the backdoor but also preserves the original optimization trajectory, thus maintaining the knowledge of the raw dataset. To achieve this, a hybrid loss is designed to integrate backdoor information along the benign optimization trajectory, ensuring that previously learned information is not forgotten. Extensive experiments demonstrate that distilled datasets are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, with risks pervasive across various raw datasets, distillation methods, and downstream training strategies. Moreover, our attack method is efficient, capable of synthesizing a malicious distilled dataset in under one minute in certain cases.</description>

      <title>XAttnMark: Learning Robust Audio Watermarking with Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative audio synthesis and editing technologies has raised significant concerns about copyright infringement, data provenance, and the spread of misinformation through deepfake audio. Watermarking offers a proactive solution by embedding imperceptible, identifiable, and traceable marks into audio content. While recent neural network-based watermarking methods like WavMark and AudioSeal have improved robustness and quality, they struggle to achieve both robust detection and accurate attribution simultaneously. This paper introduces Cross-Attention Robust Audio Watermark (XAttnMark), which bridges this gap by leveraging partial parameter sharing between the generator and the detector, a cross-attention mechanism for efficient message retrieval, and a temporal conditioning module for improved message distribution. Additionally, we propose a psychoacoustic-aligned temporal-frequency masking loss that captures fine-grained auditory masking effects, enhancing watermark imperceptibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and attribution, demonstrating superior robustness against a wide range of audio transformations, including challenging generative editing with strong editing strength.

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Data Efficient Multi-Source Transfer Learning Based on Cram\'er-Rao Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-source transfer learning provides an effective solution to data scarcity in real-world supervised learning scenarios by leveraging multiple source tasks. In this field, existing works typically use all available samples from sources in training, which constrains their training efficiency and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that answers the question: what is the optimal quantity of source samples needed from each source task to jointly train the target model? Specifically, we introduce a generalization error measure that aligns with cross-entropy loss, and minimize it based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound to determine the optimal transfer quantity for each source task. Additionally, we develop an architecture-agnostic and data-efficient algorithm OTQMS to implement our theoretical results for training deep multi-source transfer learning models. Experimental studies on diverse architectures and two real-world benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and data efficiency.

      <title>TriNER: A Series of Named Entity Recognition Models For Hindi, Bengali &amp; Marathi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: India's rich cultural and linguistic diversity poses various challenges in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER is a NLP task that aims to identify and classify tokens into different entity groups like Person, Location, Organization, Number, etc. This makes NER very useful for downstream tasks like context-aware anonymization. This paper details our work to build a multilingual NER model for the three most spoken languages in India - Hindi, Bengali &amp; Marathi. We train a custom transformer model and fine tune a few pretrained models, achieving an F1 Score of 92.11 for a total of 6 entity groups. Through this paper, we aim to introduce a single model to perform NER and significantly reduce the inconsistencies in entity groups and tag names, across the three languages.</description>

      <title>Cross the Gap: Exposing the Intra-modal Misalignment in CLIP via Modality Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained multi-modal Vision-Language Models like CLIP are widely used off-the-shelf for a variety of applications. In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

      <title>Point2RBox-v2: Rethinking Point-supervised Oriented Object Detection with Spatial Layout Among Instances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning OOD from point annotations has gained great attention. In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced.To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD. Our solution is elegant and lightweight, yet it is expected to give a competitive performance especially in densely packed scenes: 62.61%/86.15%/34.71% on DOTA/HRSC/FAIR1M.

      <title>How does a Multilingual LM Handle Multiple Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual language models have significantly advanced due to rapid progress in natural language processing. Models like BLOOM 1.7B, trained on diverse multilingual datasets, aim to bridge linguistic gaps. However, their effectiveness in capturing linguistic knowledge, particularly for low-resource languages, remains an open question. This study critically examines MLMs capabilities in multilingual understanding, semantic representation, and cross-lingual knowledge transfer. While these models perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with less-represented ones. Additionally, traditional evaluation methods often overlook their internal syntactic and semantic encoding.
  This research addresses key limitations through three objectives. First, it assesses semantic similarity by analyzing multilingual word embeddings for consistency using cosine similarity. Second, it examines BLOOM-1.7B and Qwen2 through Named Entity Recognition and sentence similarity tasks to understand their linguistic structures. Third, it explores cross-lingual knowledge transfer by evaluating generalization from high-resource to low-resource languages in sentiment analysis and text classification.
  By leveraging linguistic probing, performance metrics, and visualizations, this study provides insights into the strengths and limitations of MLMs. The findings aim to enhance multilingual NLP models, ensuring better support for both high- and low-resource languages, thereby promoting inclusivity in language technologies.</description>

      <title>Every Call is Precious: Global Optimization of Black-Box Functions with Unknown Lipschitz Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization.</description>

      <title>DexterityGen: Foundation Controller for Unprecedented Dexterity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills, such as tool use, presents a significant challenge. Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</description>

      <title>HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</description>

      <title>Great Models Think Alike and this Undermines AI Oversight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as "AI Oversight". We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing a probabilistic metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using this metric, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from "weak-to-strong generalization". As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.</description>

      <title>ChamaleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChamaleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChamaleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChamaleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/</description>

      <title>Speak Easy: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</description>

      <title>WorldSense: Evaluating Real-world Omnimodal Understanding for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce WorldSense, the first benchmark to assess the multi-modal video understanding, that simultaneously encompasses visual, audio, and text inputs. In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy). We hope our WorldSense can provide a platform for evaluating the ability in constructing and understanding coherent contexts from omni-modality.</description>

      <title>From Probability to Counterfactuals: the Increasing Complexity of Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: probabilistic (i.e. purely observational), interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas?
  Our main contribution is to prove the exact computational complexities showing that languages allowing addition and marginalization (via the summation operator) yield NP^PP, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. These are the first results to demonstrate a strictly increasing complexity across the PCH: from probabilistic to causal and counterfactual reasoning. On the other hand, in the case of full languages, i.e. allowing addition, marginalization, and multiplication, we show that the satisfiability for the counterfactual level remains the same as for the probabilistic and causal levels, solving an open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>A Generic Method for Fine-grained Category Discovery in Natural Language Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained category discovery using only coarse-grained supervision is a cost-effective yet challenging task. Previous training methods focus on aligning query samples with positive samples and distancing them from negatives. They often neglect intra-category and inter-category semantic similarities of fine-grained categories when navigating sample distributions in the embedding space. Furthermore, some evaluation techniques that rely on pre-collected test samples are inadequate for real-time applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a method that successfully detects fine-grained clusters of semantically similar texts guided by a novel objective function. The method uses semantic similarities in a logarithmic space to guide sample distributions in the Euclidean space and to form distinct clusters that represent fine-grained categories. We also propose a centroid inference mechanism to support real-time applications. The efficacy of the method is both theoretically justified and empirically confirmed on three benchmark tasks. The proposed objective function is integrated in multiple contrastive learning based neural models. Its results surpass existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Accuracy, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information of the detected fine-grained categories. Code and data will be available at Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/changtianluckyforever/F-grained-STAR.</description>

      <title>WorkArena++: Towards Compositional Planning and Reasoning-based Common Knowledge Work Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to mimic human-like intelligence has led to a surge in LLM-based autonomous agents. Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our empirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to serve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we provide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth observation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models. Overall, we expect this work to serve as a useful resource to help the community progress toward capable autonomous agents. The benchmark can be found at https://github.com/ServiceNow/WorkArena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relational approach to program synthesis. The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks. Specifically, our representation decomposes a training input-output example into sets of input and output facts respectively. We then learn relations between the input and output facts. We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate without Communication under Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination in cooperative games is a crucial challenge in artificial intelligence, particularly when players operate under incomplete information. A common strategy to mitigate this information asymmetry involves leveraging explicit communication. However, direct (verbal) communication is not always feasible due to factors such as transmission loss. Leveraging the game Gnomes at Night, we explore how effective coordination can be achieved without verbal communication, relying solely on observing each other's actions. We demonstrate how an autonomous agent can learn to cooperate by interpreting its partner's sequences of actions, which are used to hint at its intents. Our approach generates a non-Markovian strategy for the agent by learning a deterministic finite automaton for each possible action and integrating these automata into a finite-state transducer. Experimental results in a Gnomes at Night testbed show that, even without direct communication, one can learn effective cooperation strategies. Such strategies achieve significantly higher success rates and require fewer steps to complete the game compared to uncoordinated ones, and perform almost as well as in the case direct communication is allowed.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Synthetic Data in LLM Post-Training: A Reverse-Bottleneck Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process. We open-source our code at https://github.com/ZyGan1999/Towards-a-Theoretical-Understanding-of-Synthetic-Data-in-LLM-Post-Training.</description>

      <title>ImDy: Human Inverse Dynamics from Imitated Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse dynamics (ID), which aims at reproducing the driven torques from human kinematic observations, has been a critical tool for gait analysis. However, it is hindered from wider application to general motion due to its limited scalability. Conventional optimization-based ID requires expensive laboratory setups, restricting its availability. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit the recently progressive human motion imitation algorithms to learn human inverse dynamics in a data-driven manner. The key insight is that the human ID knowledge is implicitly possessed by motion imitators, though not directly applicable. In light of this, we devise an efficient data collection pipeline with state-of-the-art motion imitation algorithms and physics simulators, resulting in a large-scale human inverse dynamics benchmark as Imitated Dynamics (ImDy). ImDy contains over 150 hours of motion with joint torque and full-body ground reaction force data. With ImDy, we train a data-driven human inverse dynamics solver ImDyS(olver) in a fully supervised manner, which conducts ID and ground reaction force estimation simultaneously. Experiments on ImDy and real-world data demonstrate the impressive competency of ImDyS in human inverse dynamics and ground reaction force estimation. Moreover, the potential of ImDy(-S) as a fundamental motion analysis tool is exhibited with downstream applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/ImDy/.</description>

      <title>CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the complex interaction between innovation and regulation has become an emerging focus of our society. Despite tremendous advancements in AI's capabilities to excel in specific tasks and contribute to diverse sectors, establishing a high degree of trust in AI-generated outputs and decisions necessitates meticulous caution and continuous oversight. A broad spectrum of stakeholders, including governmental bodies, private sector corporations, academic institutions, and individuals, have launched significant initiatives. These efforts include developing ethical guidelines for AI and engaging in vibrant discussions on AI ethics, both among AI practitioners and within the broader society. This article thoroughly analyzes the ground-breaking AI regulatory framework proposed by the European Union. It delves into the fundamental ethical principles of safety, transparency, non-discrimination, traceability, and environmental sustainability for AI developments and deployments. Considering the technical efforts and strategies undertaken by academics and industry to uphold these principles, we explore the synergies and conflicts among the five ethical principles. Through this lens, work presents a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI regulations, advocating for a harmonized approach that safeguards societal values while encouraging technological advancement.</description>

Abstract: This position paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. Measuring this kind of reasoning is very informative in testing the ability of agents with self-consistent reasoning. However, it is important to note the distinction between this and what we actually care about when this self-consistency cannot be taken for granted. We call this functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to predictions about their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.</description>

      <title>PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, ``PhD-level'' knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a benchmark based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans and models, however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes are easy to spot.
  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks: OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models that are on par on benchmarks that test specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with ``I give up'' before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be remarkably ``uncertain'' in its output and in rare cases, it does not ``finish thinking,'' which suggests the need for an inference-time technique to ``wrap up'' before the context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of reasoning longer with R1 and Gemini Thinking to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely to improve accuracy on our benchmark.</description>

Abstract: This paper argues that fully autonomous AI agents should not be developed. In support of this position, we build from prior scientific literature and current product marketing to delineate different AI agent levels and detail the ethical values at play in each, documenting trade-offs in potential benefits and risks. Our analysis reveals that risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system: The more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise. Particularly concerning are safety risks, which affect human life and impact further values.</description>

      <title>The Cake that is Intelligence and Who Gets to Bake it: An AI Analogy and its Implications for Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a widely popular analogy by Turing Award Laureate Yann LeCun, machine intelligence has been compared to cake - where unsupervised learning forms the base, supervised learning adds the icing, and reinforcement learning is the cherry on top. We expand this 'cake that is intelligence' analogy from a simple structural metaphor to the full life-cycle of AI systems, extending it to sourcing of ingredients (data), conception of recipes (instructions), the baking process (training), and the tasting and selling of the cake (evaluation and distribution). Leveraging our re-conceptualization, we describe each step's entailed social ramifications and how they are bounded by statistical assumptions within machine learning. Whereas these technical foundations and social impacts are deeply intertwined, they are often studied in isolation, creating barriers that restrict meaningful participation. Our re-conceptualization paves the way to bridge this gap by mapping where technical foundations interact with social outcomes, highlighting opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue. Finally, we conclude with actionable recommendations at each stage of the metaphorical AI cake's life-cycle, empowering prospective AI practitioners, users, and researchers, with increased awareness and ability to engage in broader AI discourse.</description>

      <title>Boosting Source Code Learning with Text-Oriented Data Augmentation: An Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated remarkable advancements in source code learning, which applies deep neural networks (DNNs) to tackle various software engineering tasks. Similar to other DNN-based domains, source code learning also requires massive high-quality training data to achieve the success of these applications. Data augmentation, a technique used to produce additional training data, is widely adopted in other domains (e.g. computer vision). However, the existing practice of data augmentation in source code learning is limited to simple syntax-preserved methods, such as code refactoring. In this paper, considering that source code can also be represented as text data, we take an early step to investigate the effectiveness of data augmentation methods originally designed for natural language texts in the context of source code learning. To this end, we focus on code classification tasks and conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four critical code problems and four DNN architectures to assess the effectiveness of 25 data augmentation methods. Our results reveal specific data augmentation methods that yield more accurate and robust models for source code learning. Additionally, we discover that the data augmentation methods remain beneficial even when they slightly break source code syntax.</description>

      <title>Preserving Knowledge Invariance: Rethinking Robustness Evaluation of Open Information Extraction</title>

Abstract: The robustness to distribution changes ensures that NLP models can be successfully applied in the realistic world, especially for information extraction tasks. However, most prior evaluation benchmarks have been devoted to validating pairwise matching correctness, ignoring the crucial measurement of robustness. In this paper, we present the first benchmark that simulates the evaluation of open information extraction models in the real world, where the syntactic and expressive distributions under the same knowledge meaning may drift variously. We design and annotate a large-scale testbed in which each example is a knowledge-invariant clique that consists of sentences with structured knowledge of the same meaning but with different syntactic and expressive forms. By further elaborating the robustness metric, a model is judged to be robust if its performance is consistently accurate on the overall cliques. We perform experiments on typical models published in the last decade as well as a popular large language model, the results show that the existing successful models exhibit a frustrating degradation, with a maximum drop of 23.43 F1 score.

      <title>Efficient and Flexible Neural Network Training through Layer-wise Feedback Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning enabling the vast advances of AI development over the past decades. However, since this type of optimization requires differentiation, it reduces flexibility in the choice of model and objective. With recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors utilizing methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions to solving a given task without imposing any differentiability requirements. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP offers the advantage that it obtains sparse models due to an implicit weight scaling. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. We further investigate two applications for LFP: Firstly, neural network pruning, and secondly, the optimization of neuromorphic architectures such as Heaviside step function activated Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). In the first setting, LFP naturally generates sparse models that are easily prunable and thus efficiently encode and compute information. In the second setting, LFP achieves comparable performance to surrogate gradient descent, but provides approximation-free training, which eases the implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Consequently, LFP combines efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. model architecture and objective function. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>Logic-Q: Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading via Program Sketch-based Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative trading (Q-trading) by achieving decent performance without significant human expert knowledge. Despite its achievements, we observe that the current state-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market trends, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large drawdowns when encountering market crashes. To address this limitation, a natural approach is to incorporate human expert knowledge in identifying market trends. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In order to effectively leverage abstract human expert knowledge, in this paper, we propose a universal logic-guided deep reinforcement learning framework for Q-trading, called Logic-Q. In particular, Logic-Q adopts the program synthesis by sketching paradigm and introduces a logic-guided model design that leverages a lightweight, plug-and-play market trend-aware program sketch to determine the market trend and correspondingly adjusts the DRL policy in a post-hoc manner. Extensive evaluations of two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate that Logic-Q can significantly improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art DRL trading strategies.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Inference Perspective of Offline RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.</description>

      <title>GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an important emerging research area that attracts increasing attention within the pattern recognition community. With distinctive advantages across various application scenarios, numerous 3D skeleton based person re-identification (SRID) methods with diverse skeleton modeling and learning paradigms have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of recent SRID advances. First of all, we define the SRID task and provide an overview of its origin and major advancements. Secondly, we formulate a systematic taxonomy that organizes existing methods into three categories based on different skeleton modeling ($i.e.,$ hand-crafted, sequence-based, graph-based). Then, we elaborate on the representative models along these three categories with an analysis of their merits and limitations. Meanwhile, we provide an in-depth review of mainstream supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised SRID learning paradigms and corresponding skeleton semantics learning tasks. A thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art SRID methods is further conducted over various types of benchmarks and protocols to compare their effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we discuss the challenges of existing studies along with promising directions for future research, highlighting research impacts and potential applications of SRID.</description>

      <title>EBBS: An Ensemble with Bi-Level Beam Search for Zero-Shot Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of zero-shot translation emerges when we train a multilingual model with certain translation directions; the model can then directly translate in unseen directions. Alternatively, zero-shot translation can be accomplished by pivoting through a third language (e.g., English). In our work, we observe that both direct and pivot translations are noisy and achieve less satisfactory performance. We propose EBBS, an ensemble method with a novel bi-level beam search algorithm, where each ensemble component explores its own prediction step by step at the lower level but they are synchronized by a "soft voting" mechanism at the upper level. Results on two popular multilingual translation datasets show that EBBS consistently outperforms direct and pivot translations as well as existing ensemble techniques. Further, we can distill the ensemble's knowledge back to the multilingual model to improve inference efficiency; profoundly, our EBBS-based distillation does not sacrifice, or even improves, the translation quality.</description>

      <title>Robust Decision Aggregation with Adversarial Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a robust aggregation problem in the presence of both truthful and adversarial experts. The truthful experts will report their private signals truthfully, while the adversarial experts can report arbitrarily. We assume experts are marginally symmetric in the sense that they share the same common prior and marginal posteriors. The rule maker needs to design an aggregator to predict the true world state from these experts' reports, without knowledge of the underlying information structures or adversarial strategies. We aim to find the optimal aggregator that outputs a forecast minimizing regret under the worst information structure and adversarial strategies. The regret is defined by the difference in expected loss between the aggregator and a benchmark who aggregates optimally given the information structure and reports of truthful experts.
  We focus on binary states and reports. Under L1 loss, we show that the truncated mean aggregator is optimal. When there are at most k adversaries, this aggregator discards the k lowest and highest reported values and averages the remaining ones. For L2 loss, the optimal aggregators are piecewise linear functions. All the optimalities hold when the ratio of adversaries is bounded above by a value determined by the experts' priors and posteriors. The regret only depends on the ratio of adversaries, not on their total number. For hard aggregators that output a decision, we prove that a random version of the truncated mean is optimal for both L1 and L2. This aggregator randomly follows a remaining value after discarding the $k$ lowest and highest reported values. We extend the hard aggregator to multi-state setting. We evaluate our aggregators numerically in an ensemble learning task. We also obtain negative results for general adversarial aggregation problems under broader information structures and report spaces.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Neural Network Training via Synthetic Intermediate Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of extensive neural network architectures, particularly deep learning models, presents a challenge in terms of resource-intensive training. GPU memory constraints have become a notable bottleneck in training such sizable models. Existing strategies, including data parallelism, model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and fully sharded data parallelism, offer partial solutions. Model parallelism, in particular, enables the distribution of the entire model across multiple GPUs, yet the ensuing data communication between these partitions slows down training. Additionally, the substantial memory overhead required to store auxiliary parameters on each GPU compounds computational demands. Instead of using the entire model for training, this study advocates partitioning the model across GPUs and generating synthetic intermediate labels to train individual segments. These labels, produced through a random process, mitigate memory overhead and computational load. This approach results in a more efficient training process that minimizes data communication while maintaining model accuracy. To validate this method, a 6-layer fully connected neural network is partitioned into two parts and its performance is assessed on the extended MNIST dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves similar testing accuracies to conventional training methods, while significantly reducing memory and computational requirements. This work contributes to mitigating the resource-intensive nature of training large neural networks, paving the way for more efficient deep learning model development.</description>

      <title>CollagePrompt: A Benchmark for Budget-Friendly Visual Recognition with GPT-4V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have suggested that by taking visual prompts, GPT-4V can demonstrate significant proficiency in visual recognition tasks. Despite its impressive capabilities, the financial cost associated with GPT-4V's inference presents a substantial barrier to its wide use. To address this challenge, we propose a budget-friendly collage prompting task that collages multiple images into a single visual prompt and makes GPT-4V perform visual recognition on several images simultaneously, thereby reducing the cost. We collect a dataset of various collage prompts to assess its performance in GPT-4V's visual recognition. Our evaluations reveal several key findings: 1) Recognition accuracy varies with different positions in the collage. 2) Grouping images of the same category together leads to better visual recognition results. 3) Incorrect labels often come from adjacent images. These findings highlight the importance of image arrangement within collage prompt. To this end, we construct a benchmark called CollagePrompt, which offers a platform for designing collage prompt to achieve more cost-effective visual recognition with GPT-4V. A baseline method derived from genetic algorithms to optimize collage layouts is proposed and two metrics are introduced to measure the efficiency of the optimized collage prompt. Our benchmark enables researchers to better optimize collage prompts, thus making GPT-4V more cost-effective in visual recognition. The code and data are available at this project page https://collageprompting.github.io/.</description>

      <title>MA4DIV: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Search Result Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search result diversification (SRD), which aims to ensure that documents in a ranking list cover a broad range of subtopics, is a significant and widely studied problem in Information Retrieval and Web Search. Existing methods primarily utilize a paradigm of "greedy selection", i.e., selecting one document with the highest diversity score at a time or optimize an approximation of the objective function. These approaches tend to be inefficient and are easily trapped in a suboptimal state. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for search result DIVersity, which called MA4DIV. In this approach, each document is an agent and the search result diversification is modeled as a cooperative task among multiple agents. By modeling the SRD ranking problem as a cooperative MARL problem, this approach allows for directly optimizing the diversity metrics, such as $\alpha$-NDCG, while achieving high training efficiency. We conducted experiments on public TREC datasets and a larger scale dataset in the industrial setting. The experiemnts show that MA4DIV achieves substantial improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency than existing baselines, especially on the industrial dataset. The code of MA4DIV can be seen on https://github.com/chenyiqun/MA4DIV.</description>

      <title>Hessian-Free Online Certified Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data. Recent advances suggest pre-computing and storing statistics extracted from second-order information and implementing unlearning through Newton-style updates. However, the Hessian matrix operations are extremely costly and previous works conduct unlearning for empirical risk minimizer with the convexity assumption, precluding their applicability to high-dimensional over-parameterized models and the nonconvergence condition. In this paper, we propose an efficient Hessian-free unlearning approach. The key idea is to maintain a statistical vector for each training data, computed through affine stochastic recursion of the difference between the retrained and learned models. We prove that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the unlearning and generalization guarantees, the deletion capacity, and the time/storage complexity, under the same regularity conditions. Through the strategy of recollecting statistics for removing data, we develop an online unlearning algorithm that achieves near-instantaneous data removal, as it requires only vector addition. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time/storage costs with millisecond-level unlearning execution, while also enhancing test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Chain-of-Thought: A Survey of Chain-of-X Paradigms for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been a widely adopted prompting method, eliciting impressive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by the sequential thought structure of CoT, a number of Chain-of-X (CoX) methods have been developed to address various challenges across diverse domains and tasks involving LLMs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of Chain-of-X methods for LLMs in different contexts. Specifically, we categorize them by taxonomies of nodes, i.e., the X in CoX, and application tasks. We also discuss the findings and implications of existing CoX methods, as well as potential future directions. Our survey aims to serve as a detailed and up-to-date resource for researchers seeking to apply the idea of CoT to broader scenarios.</description>

      <title>Context Steering: Controllable Personalization at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deliver high-quality, personalized responses, large language models (LLMs) must effectively incorporate context -- personal, demographic, and cultural information specific to an end-user. For example, asking the model to explain Newton's second law with the context "I am a toddler" should produce a response different from when the context is "I am a physics professor". However, leveraging the context in practice is a nuanced and challenging task, and is often dependent on the specific situation or user base. The model must strike a balance between providing specific, personalized responses and maintaining general applicability. Current solutions, such as prompt-engineering and fine-tuning, require collection of contextually appropriate responses as examples, making them time-consuming and less flexible to use across different contexts. In this work, we introduce Context Steering (CoS) -- a simple, training-free decoding approach that amplifies the influence of the context in next token predictions. CoS computes contextual influence by comparing the output probabilities from two LLM forward passes: one that includes the context and one that does not. By linearly scaling the contextual influence, CoS allows practitioners to flexibly control the degree of personalization for different use cases. We show that CoS can be applied to autoregressive LLMs, and demonstrates strong performance in personalized recommendations. Additionally, we show that CoS can function as a Bayesian Generative model to infer and quantify correlations between open-ended texts, broadening its potential applications.</description>

      <title>CTD4 -- A Deep Continuous Distributional Actor-Critic Agent with a Kalman Fusion of Multiple Critics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) has demonstrated superior sample efficiency in learning complex tasks compared to conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. However, the practical application of CDRL is encumbered by challenging projection steps, detailed parameter tuning, and domain knowledge. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pioneering Continuous Distributional Model-Free RL algorithm tailored for continuous action spaces. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of distributional RL, adopting an actor-critic architecture wherein the critic outputs a continuous probability distribution. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of multiple critics fused through a Kalman fusion mechanism to mitigate overestimation bias. Through a series of experiments, we validate that our proposed method provides a sample-efficient solution for executing complex continuous-control tasks.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Artificial Intelligence in Gait-Based Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13082v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 169 studies, we present recent technical advancements, discuss existing challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Causal Concept Graph Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying the decisions of deep neural network (DNN) models. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, circumventing causal opacity in DNNs represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness.</description>

      <title>Why Has Predicting Downstream Capabilities of Frontier AI Models with Scale Remained Elusive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting changes from scaling advanced AI systems is a desirable property for engineers, economists, governments and industry alike, and, while a well-established literature exists on how pretraining performance scales, predictable scaling behavior on downstream capabilities remains elusive. While many factors are certainly responsible, this paper identifies a significant factor that makes predicting scaling behavior on widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks challenging and illuminates a path towards making such downstream evaluations predictable with scale. Using five model families and twelve well-established multiple-choice benchmarks, we demonstrate that downstream performance is computed from negative log likelihoods via a sequence of transformations that progressively degrades the statistical relationship between performance and scale. We then pinpoint the mechanism causing this degradation: downstream metrics require comparing the correct choice against a small number of specific incorrect choices, meaning accurately predicting downstream capabilities requires predicting not just how probability mass concentrates on the correct choice with scale, but also how probability mass fluctuates on the alternative incorrect choices with scale. We empirically study how probability mass on the correct choice co-varies with probability mass on incorrect choices with increasing compute, suggesting that scaling laws for \textit{incorrect} choices might be achievable. Our work also explains why pretraining scaling laws are commonly regarded as more predictable than downstream capabilities and contributes towards establishing scaling-predictable evaluations of frontier AI models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nearest Neighbor based Uncertainty Estimation for Natural Language Processing Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in model predictions is crucial for safety-critical applications in the real world. However, deep neural networks often suffer from the issues of uncertainty estimation, such as miscalibration. In this study, we propose $k$-Nearest Neighbor Uncertainty Estimation ($k$NN-UE), which is a new uncertainty estimation method that uses not only the distances from the neighbors, but also the ratio of labels in the neighbors. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and named entity recognition show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines and recent density-based methods in several calibration and uncertainty metrics. Moreover, our analyses indicate that approximate nearest neighbor search techniques reduce the inference overhead without significantly degrading the uncertainty estimation performance when they are appropriately combined.</description>

      <title>SKADA-Bench: Benchmarking Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Methods with Realistic Validation On Diverse Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors. SKADA-bench is available on Github at https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada-bench.</description>

      <title>SoNIC: Safe Social Navigation with Adaptive Conformal Inference and Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables social robots to generate trajectories without relying on human-designed rules or interventions, making it generally more effective than rule-based systems in adapting to complex, dynamic real-world scenarios. However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. The video demos can be found on our project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/.</description>

      <title>AgentGen: Enhancing Planning Abilities for Large Language Model based Agent via Environment and Task Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks. Project page: https://agent-gen.github.io/.</description>

      <title>On Effects of Steering Latent Representation for Large Language Model Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. We investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. We show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU--a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>DiffZOO: A Purely Query-Based Black-Box Attack for Red-teaming Text-to-Image Generative Model via Zeroth Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) synthesis diffusion models raise misuse concerns, particularly in creating prohibited or not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</description>

      <title>How Reliable are Causal Probing Interventions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) no method is reliable across all layers; (2) more reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; (3) nonlinear interventions are more reliable in early and intermediate layers, and linear interventions are more reliable in later layers; and (4) concept removal methods are far less reliable than counterfactual interventions, suggesting that they may not be an effective approach to causal probing.</description>

      <title>KAN See In the Dark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing low-light image enhancement methods are difficult to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between normal and low-light images due to uneven illumination and noise effects. The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) feature spline-based convolutional layers and learnable activation functions, which can effectively capture nonlinear dependencies. In this paper, we design a KAN-Block based on KANs and innovatively apply it to low-light image enhancement. This method effectively alleviates the limitations of current methods constrained by linear network structures and lack of interpretability, further demonstrating the potential of KANs in low-level vision tasks. Given the poor perception of current low-light image enhancement methods and the stochastic nature of the inverse diffusion process, we further introduce frequency-domain perception for visually oriented enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on benchmark datasets. The code will be available at: https://github.com/AXNing/KSID}{https://github.com/AXNing/KSID.</description>

      <title>Language Models "Grok" to Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.</description>

      <title>OpenRANet: Neuralized Spectrum Access by Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation with Optimization-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next-generation radio access network (RAN), known as Open RAN, is poised to feature an AI-native interface for wireless cellular networks, including emerging satellite-terrestrial systems, making deep learning integral to its operation. In this paper, we address the nonconvex optimization challenge of joint subcarrier and power allocation in Open RAN, with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while ensuring users meet their transmission data rate requirements. We propose OpenRANet, an optimization-based deep learning model that integrates machine-learning techniques with iterative optimization algorithms. We start by transforming the original nonconvex problem into convex subproblems through decoupling, variable transformation, and relaxation techniques. These subproblems are then efficiently solved using iterative methods within the standard interference function framework, enabling the derivation of primal-dual solutions. These solutions integrate seamlessly as a convex optimization layer within OpenRANet, enhancing constraint adherence, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency by combining machine learning with convex analysis, as shown in numerical experiments. OpenRANet also serves as a foundation for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies for broader scenarios like multi-cell systems, satellite-terrestrial networks, and future Open RAN deployments with complex power consumption requirements.</description>

      <title>Thought-Path Contrastive Learning via Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation for Logical Reading Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logical reading comprehension is a challenging task that entails grasping the underlying semantics of text and applying reasoning to deduce the correct answer. Prior researches have primarily focused on enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or data augmentation. However, previous work constructing chain-of-thought rationales concentrates solely on analyzing correct options, neglecting the incorrect alternatives. Addtionally, earlier efforts on data augmentation by altering contexts rely on rule-based methods, which result in generated contexts that lack diversity and coherence. To address these issues, we propose a Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation (PODA) framework. This framework can generate CoT rationales including analyses for both correct and incorrect options, while constructing diverse and high-quality counterfactual contexts from incorrect candidate options. We integrate summarizing premises and identifying premises for each option into rationales. Subsequently, we employ multi-step prompts with identified premises to construct counterfactual context. To facilitate the model's capabilities to better differentiate the reasoning process associated with each option, we introduce a novel thought-path contrastive learning method that compares reasoning paths between the original and counterfactual samples. Experimental results on three representative LLMs demonstrate that our method can improve the baselines substantially across two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks (ReClor and LogiQA 2.0). The data and code are released at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/TPReasoner.</description>

      <title>House of Cards: Massive Weights in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive activations, which manifest in specific feature dimensions of hidden states, introduce a significant bias in large language models (LLMs), leading to an overemphasis on the corresponding token. In this paper, we identify that massive activations originate not from the hidden state but from the intermediate state of a feed-forward network module in an early layer. Expanding on the previous observation that massive activations occur only in specific feature dimensions, we dive deep into the weights that cause massive activations. Specifically, we define top-$k$ massive weights as the weights that contribute to the dimensions with the top-$k$ magnitudes in the intermediate state. When these massive weights are set to zero, the functionality of LLMs is entirely disrupted. However, when all weights except for massive weights are set to zero, it results in a relatively minor performance drop, even though a much larger number of weights are set to zero. This implies that during the pre-training process, learning is dominantly focused on massive weights. Building on this observation, we propose a simple plug-and-play method called MacDrop (massive weights curriculum dropout), to rely less on massive weights during parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This method applies dropout to the pre-trained massive weights, starting with a high dropout probability and gradually decreasing it as fine-tuning progresses. Through various experiments, including zero-shot downstream tasks, long-context tasks, and ablation studies, we demonstrate that \texttt{MacDrop} generally improves performance and strengthens robustness.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large neural networks excel at prediction tasks, but their application to design problems, such as protein engineering or materials discovery, requires solving offline model-based optimization (MBO) problems. While predictive models may not directly translate to effective design, recent MBO algorithms incorporate reinforcement learning and generative modeling approaches. Meanwhile, theoretical work suggests that exploiting the target function's structure can enhance MBO performance. We present Cliqueformer, a transformer-based architecture that learns the black-box function's structure through functional graphical models (FGM), addressing distribution shift without relying on explicit conservative approaches. Across various domains, including chemical and genetic design tasks, Cliqueformer demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Probabilities of Rare Outputs in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of low probability estimation: given a machine learning model and a formally-specified input distribution, how can we estimate the probability of a binary property of the model's output, even when that probability is too small to estimate by random sampling? This problem is motivated by the need to improve worst-case performance, which distribution shift can make much more likely. We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models. We compare two types of methods: importance sampling, which involves searching for inputs giving rise to the rare output, and activation extrapolation, which involves extrapolating a probability distribution fit to the model's logits. We find that importance sampling outperforms activation extrapolation, but both outperform naive sampling. Finally, we explain how minimizing the probability estimate of an undesirable behavior generalizes adversarial training, and argue that new methods for low probability estimation are needed to provide stronger guarantees about worst-case performance.</description>

      <title>A Complexity-Based Theory of Compositionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning and Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

      <title>Bench4Merge: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Merging in Realistic Dense Traffic with Micro-Interactive Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the capabilities of autonomous driving have advanced rapidly, merging into dense traffic remains a significant challenge, many motion planning methods for this scenario have been proposed but it is hard to evaluate them. Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging large language models to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main road. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the advanced nature of this evaluation benchmark. Through this benchmark, we have obtained an evaluation of existing methods and identified common issues. The environment and vehicle motion planning models we have designed can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Bench4Merge-EB5D</description>

      <title>Collapse or Thrive? Perils and Promises of Synthetic Data in a Self-Generating World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What happens when generative machine learning models are pretrained on web-scale datasets containing data generated by earlier models? Some prior work warns of "model collapse" as the web is overwhelmed by synthetic data; other work suggests the problem can be contained (i.e. collapse can be avoided) by managing how available data are used in pretraining. In this paper, we report experiments on three ways of using data (training-workflows), across three generative model task-settings (multivariate Gaussian estimation, kernel density estimation, and language-model fine-tuning) to further confirm the possibility of containment: (a) we confirm that the training-workflow of {\it replacing} all real data by successive generations of purely synthetic data indeed suffers model collapse in all task-settings studied; (b) we consider the training-workflow of {\it accumulating} synthetic data alongside real data and training on all data combined and confirming that, although the proportion of real data eventually becomes zero, models remain stable and their test losses do not diverge under this training-workflow; (c) we consider a training-workflow where real and synthetic data accumulate together but successive generations of pretraining are constrained to use fixed-size data subsets each generation. In this workflow, we observe slow and gradual rather than explosive degradation of test loss performance across generations. Our insights are particularly important when forecasting whether future frontier generative models will collapse or thrive, and our results open avenues for empirically and mathematically studying the context-dependent value of synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Unpicking Data at the Seams: Understanding Disentanglement in VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying statistically independent factors of the data, is relevant to much of machine learning, from controlled data generation and robust classification to efficient encoding and improving our understanding of the data itself. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Recent progress has been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where a choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is shown to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We build on this to show how such orthogonality, a geometric property, translates to disentanglement, a statistical property, furthering our understanding of how a VAE identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</description>

      <title>Adapting While Learning: Grounding LLMs for Scientific Problems with Intelligent Tool Usage Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving simple scientific problems but, even with domain-specific fine-tuning, often produce hallucinations for complex ones. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this reliability issue, models finetuned on tool usage only often over-rely on them, incurring unnecessary costs from resource-intensive scientific tools even for simpler problems. Inspired by how human experts assess the complexity of the problem before choosing the solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tools-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we classify questions as easy or hard based on the WKL-trained model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for simple problems while switching to tools for challenging ones. We validate our method on 6 scientific benchmark datasets in climate science, epidemiology, and mathematics. Compared to the base 8B model, our trained models achieve 28.27% higher answer accuracy and 13.76% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 on 4 custom-created datasets.</description>

      <title>Self-Training Meets Consistency: Improving LLMs' Reasoning with Consistency-Driven Rationale Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training approach for large language models (LLMs) improves reasoning abilities by training the models on their self-generated rationales. Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</description>

      <title>Fair Summarization: Bridging Quality and Diversity in Extractive Summaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization of user-generated content remains a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods often fail to ensure equitable representation across different social groups, leading to biased outputs. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods for fair extractive summarization: FairExtract, a clustering-based approach, and FairGPT, which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints. We evaluate these methods using Divsumm summarization dataset of White-aligned, Hispanic, and African-American dialect tweets and compare them against relevant baselines. The results obtained using a comprehensive set of summarization quality metrics such as SUPERT, BLANC, SummaQA, BARTScore, and UniEval, as well as a fairness metric F, demonstrate that FairExtract and FairGPT achieve superior fairness while maintaining competitive summarization quality. Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework, offering a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between these objectives. This work highlights the importance of fairness in summarization and sets a benchmark for future research in fairness-aware NLP models.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels to Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning of Dynamic Bayesian Network via Continuous Optimization from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, learning the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network has been centralized, requiring all data to be pooled in one location. However, in real-world scenarios, data are often distributed across multiple entities (e.g., companies, devices) that seek to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving data privacy and security. More importantly, due to the presence of diverse clients, the data may follow different distributions, resulting in data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses additional challenges for centralized approaches. In this study, we first introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from homogeneous time series data that are horizontally distributed across different parties. We then extend this approach to heterogeneous time series data by incorporating a proximal operator as a regularization term in a personalized federated learning framework. To this end, we propose \texttt{FDBNL} and \texttt{PFDBNL}, which leverage continuous optimization, ensuring that only model parameters are exchanged during the optimization process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in scenarios with many clients and limited individual sample sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OneKE, a dockerized schema-guided knowledge extraction system, which can extract knowledge from the Web and raw PDF Books, and support various domains (science, news, etc.). Specifically, we design OneKE with multiple agents and a configure knowledge base. Different agents perform their respective roles, enabling support for various extraction scenarios. The configure knowledge base facilitates schema configuration, error case debugging and correction, further improving the performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate OneKE's efficacy, while case studies further elucidate its adaptability to diverse tasks across multiple domains, highlighting its potential for broad applications.

      <title>Efficiently Serving Large Multimodal Models Using EPD Disaggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by handling diverse inputs such as images, audio, and video, but at the cost of adding a multimodal encoding stage that increases both computational and memory overhead. This step negatively impacting key Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like time to first token (TTFT) and end-to-end throughput (E2ETP). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouple these steps unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a new mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize encoding load within a request, a module to find the optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15$\times$ less utilization), batch sizes (up to 22$\times$ larger), 10$\times$ more images/request, and 2.2$\times$ larger KV caches. Further, it leads to significant improvements in latency metrics (TTFT up to 71\% reduction) and end-to-end throughput (up to 57\% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.</description>

      <title>Detection, Retrieval, and Explanation Unified: A Violence Detection System Based on Knowledge Graphs and GAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, violence detection systems developed using unified multimodal models have achieved significant success and attracted widespread attention. However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</description>

      <title>BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network: Bidirectional Depth Deep Learning Architecture for Spatial-Temporal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatial-temporal (ST) information in dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is a crucial yet challenging problem. The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</description>

      <title>SplitQuant: Layer Splitting for Low-Bit Neural Network Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization for deep neural networks (DNNs) is the process of mapping the parameter values of DNNs from original data types to other data types of lower precision to reduce model sizes and make inference faster. Quantization often maps different original values to a single quantized value because the range of the original values is larger than the range of the quantized values. This leads to the degradation of the accuracy of the quantized DNNs. Outliers are a main cause of the degradation of quantization resolution because they enlarge the range of original values. To solve the problem, the percentile method is often used to clip outliers. However, clipping the outliers has another problem of removing the important and strong signals in the DNNs. This paper proposes SplitQuant to keep the outliers and improve the quantization resolution at the same time. SplitQuant narrows down the range of the original values and mitigates the effect of outliers by splitting each quantizable layer into three mathematically equivalent layers and applies different scaling factors. Especially, weights and biases are clustered into lower, middle and upper clusters for optimized split. By preprocessing DNNs with SplitQuant, quantization algorithms can achieve better results. SplitQuant was applied on two BERT-Tiny models and improved the accuracy of INT2 quantization by 3.3%p and 2.1%p, achieving accuracies comparable to those of the original FP32 models.</description>

      <title>MambaQuant: Quantizing the Mamba Family with Variance Aligned Rotation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks.

      <title>K-COMP: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Domain Question Answering With Knowledge-Injected Compressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented question answering (QA) integrates external information and thereby increases the QA accuracy of reader models that lack domain knowledge. However, documents retrieved for closed domains require high expertise, so the reader model may have difficulty fully comprehending the text. Moreover, the retrieved documents contain thousands of tokens, some unrelated to the question. As a result, the documents include some inaccurate information, which could lead the reader model to mistrust the passages and could result in hallucinations. To solve these problems, we propose K-comp (Knowledge-injected compressor) which provides the knowledge required to answer correctly. The compressor automatically generates the prior knowledge necessary to facilitate the answer process prior to compression of the retrieved passages. Subsequently, the passages are compressed autoregressively, with the generated knowledge being integrated into the compression process. This process ensures alignment between the question intent and the compressed context. By augmenting this prior knowledge and concise context, the reader models are guided toward relevant answers and trust the context.</description>

      <title>Humanity's Last Exam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in difficulty: LLMs now achieve over 90\% accuracy on popular benchmarks like MMLU, limiting informed measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. In response, we introduce Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of human knowledge, designed to be the final closed-ended academic benchmark of its kind with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 3,000 questions across dozens of subjects, including mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences. HLE is developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable, but cannot be quickly answered via internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy and calibration on HLE, highlighting a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions. To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model capabilities, we publicly release HLE at https://lastexam.ai.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Complexity: Understanding Visual Complexity Through Structure, Color, and Surprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding human perception of visual complexity is crucial in visual cognition. Recently (Shen, et al. 2024) proposed an interpretable segmentation-based model that accurately predicted complexity across various datasets, supporting the idea that complexity can be explained simply. In this work, we investigate the failure of their model to capture structural, color and surprisal contributions to complexity. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Sobel Gradient which measures spatial intensity variations, Multi-Scale Unique Color which quantifies colorfulness across multiple scales, and surprise scores generated using a Large Language Model. We test our features on existing benchmarks and a novel dataset containing surprising images from Visual Genome. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling complexity accurately is not as simple as previously thought, requiring additional perceptual and semantic factors to address dataset biases. Thus our results offer deeper insights into how humans assess visual complexity.</description>

      <title>Strassen Attention: Unlocking Compositional Abilities in Transformers Based on a New Lower Bound Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to evaluate the theoretical limits of Transformers, allowing us to prove the first lower bounds against one-layer softmax Transformers with infinite precision. We establish those bounds for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all triples of positions. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: one is composition of functions (Peng et al., 2024) and the other is composition of binary relations. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that with this mechanism a one-layer Transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. We also show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023) and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.</description>

      <title>Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) for Improving Accuracy of Model Prediction and Scientific Understanding of Soil Organic Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance our understanding of the global carbon cycle and other biogeochemical processes. However, retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data remains a challenge. Here, we develop a Biogeochemistry-Informed Neural Network (BINN) that seamlessly integrates a vectorized process-based soil carbon cycle model (i.e., Community Land Model version 5, CLM5) into a neural network (NN) structure to examine mechanisms governing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage from big data. BINN demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving biogeochemical parameter values from synthetic data in a parameter recovery experiment. We use BINN to predict six major processes regulating the soil carbon cycle (or components in process-based models) from 25,925 observed SOC profiles across the conterminous US and compared them with the same processes previously retrieved by a Bayesian inference-based PROcess-guided deep learning and DAta-driven modeling (PRODA) approach (Tao et al. 2020; 2023). The high agreement between the spatial patterns of the retrieved processes using the two approaches with an average correlation coefficient of 0.81 confirms BINN's ability in retrieving mechanistic knowledge from big data. Additionally, the integration of neural networks and process-based models in BINN improves computational efficiency by more than 50 times over PRODA. We conclude that BINN is a transformative tool that harnesses the power of both AI and process-based modeling, facilitating new scientific discoveries while improving interpretability and accuracy of Earth system models.</description>

      <title>FetDTIAlign: A Deep Learning Framework for Affine and Deformable Registration of Fetal Brain dMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides unique insights into fetal brain microstructure in utero. Longitudinal and cross-sectional fetal dMRI studies can reveal crucial neurodevelopmental changes but require precise spatial alignment across scans and subjects. This is challenging due to low data quality, rapid brain development, and limited anatomical landmarks. Existing registration methods, designed for high-quality adult data, struggle with these complexities. To address this, we introduce FetDTIAlign, a deep learning approach for fetal brain dMRI registration, enabling accurate affine and deformable alignment. FetDTIAlign features a dual-encoder architecture and iterative feature-based inference, reducing the impact of noise and low resolution. It optimizes network configurations and domain-specific features at each registration stage, enhancing both robustness and accuracy. We validated FetDTIAlign on data from 23 to 36 weeks gestation, covering 60 white matter tracts. It consistently outperformed two classical optimization-based methods and a deep learning pipeline, achieving superior anatomical correspondence. Further validation on external data from the Developing Human Connectome Project confirmed its generalizability across acquisition protocols. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning for fetal brain dMRI registration, providing a more accurate and reliable alternative to classical techniques. By enabling precise cross-subject and tract-specific analyses, FetDTIAlign supports new discoveries in early brain development.</description>

      <title>Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion-model to address the specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</description>

      <title>ACECODER: Acing Coder RL via Automated Test-Case Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most progress in recent coder models has been driven by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</description>

      <title>From Fog to Failure: How Dehazing Can Harm Clear Image Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</description>

      <title>Model Human Learners: Computational Models to Guide Instructional Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instructional designers face an overwhelming array of design choices, making it challenging to identify the most effective interventions. To address this issue, I propose the concept of a Model Human Learner, a unified computational model of learning that can aid designers in evaluating candidate interventions. This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical insights into why an instructional intervention is effective. These findings lay the groundwork for future Model Human Learners that integrate cognitive and learning theories to support instructional design across diverse tasks and interventions.</description>

      <title>A Unified and General Humanoid Whole-Body Controller for Fine-Grained Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locomotion is a fundamental skill for humanoid robots. However, most existing works made locomotion a single, tedious, unextendable, and passive movement. This limits the kinematic capabilities of humanoid robots. In contrast, humans possess versatile athletic abilities-running, jumping, hopping, and finely adjusting walking parameters such as frequency, and foot height. In this paper, we investigate solutions to bring such versatility into humanoid locomotion and thereby propose HUGWBC: a unified and general humanoid whole-body controller for fine-grained locomotion. By designing a general command space in the aspect of tasks and behaviors, along with advanced techniques like symmetrical loss and intervention training for learning a whole-body humanoid controlling policy in simulation, HugWBC enables real-world humanoid robots to produce various natural gaits, including walking (running), jumping, standing, and hopping, with customizable parameters such as frequency, foot swing height, further combined with different body height, waist rotation, and body pitch, all in one single policy. Beyond locomotion, HUGWBC also supports real-time interventions from external upper-body controllers like teleoperation, enabling loco-manipulation while maintaining precise control under any locomotive behavior. Our experiments validate the high tracking accuracy and robustness of HUGWBC with/without upper-body intervention for all commands, and we further provide an in-depth analysis of how the various commands affect humanoid movement and offer insights into the relationships between these commands. To our knowledge, HugWBC is the first humanoid whole-body controller that supports such fine-grained locomotion behaviors with high robustness and flexibility.</description>
