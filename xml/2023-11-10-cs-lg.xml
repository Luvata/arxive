<title>MELEP: A Novel Predictive Measure of Transferability in Multi-Label ECG Analysis. (arXiv:2311.04224v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04224</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce MELEP, which stands for Muti-label Expected Log of Empirical
Predictions, a novel measure to estimate how effective it is to transfer
knowledge from a pre-trained model to a downstream task in a multi-label
settings. The measure is generic to work with new target data having a
different label set from source data. It is also computationally efficient,
only requires forward passing the downstream dataset through the pre-trained
model once. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a
transferability metric for multi-label ECG classification problems. Our
experiments show that MELEP can predict the performance of pre-trained
convolutional and recurrent deep neural networks, on small and imbalanced ECG
data. Specifically, strong correlation coefficients, with absolute values
exceeding 0.6 in most cases, were observed between MELEP and the actual average
F1 scores of the fine-tuned models.

<title>Fast, accurate, and interpretable decoding of electrocorticographic signals using dynamic mode decomposition. (arXiv:2311.04225v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04225</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Dynamic mode (DM) decomposition decomposes spatiotemporal signals into basic
oscillatory components (DMs). DMs can improve the accuracy of neural decoding
when used with the nonlinear Grassmann kernel, compared to conventional power
features. However, such kernel-based machine learning algorithms have three
limitations: large computational time preventing real-time application,
incompatibility with non-kernel algorithms, and low interpretability. Here, we
propose a mapping function corresponding to the Grassmann kernel that
explicitly transforms DMs into spatial DM (sDM) features, which can be used in
any machine learning algorithm. Using electrocorticographic signals recorded
during various movement and visual perception tasks, the sDM features were
shown to improve the decoding accuracy and computational time compared to
conventional methods. Furthermore, the components of the sDM features
informative for decoding showed similar characteristics to the high-$\gamma$
power of the signals, but with higher trial-to-trial reproducibility. The
proposed sDM features enable fast, accurate, and interpretable neural decoding.

<title>Assessing Upper Limb Motor Function in the Immediate Post-Stroke Perioud Using Accelerometry. (arXiv:2311.04226v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04226</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Accelerometry has been extensively studied as an objective means of measuring
upper limb function in patients post-stroke. The objective of this paper is to
determine whether the accelerometry-derived measurements frequently used in
more long-term rehabilitation studies can also be used to monitor and rapidly
detect sudden changes in upper limb motor function in more recently
hospitalized stroke patients. Six binary classification models were created by
training on variable data window times of paretic upper limb accelerometer
feature data. The models were assessed on their effectiveness for
differentiating new input data into two classes: severe or moderately severe
motor function. The classification models yielded Area Under the Curve (AUC)
scores that ranged from 0.72 to 0.82 for 15-minute data windows to 0.77 to 0.94
for 120-minute data windows. These results served as a preliminary assessment
and a basis on which to further investigate the efficacy of using accelerometry
and machine learning to alert healthcare professionals to rapid changes in
motor function in the days immediately following a stroke.

<title>Graph Neural Networks for Topological Feature Extraction in ECG Classification. (arXiv:2311.04228v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04228</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a dependable instrument for assessing the
function of the cardiovascular system. There has recently been much emphasis on
precisely classifying ECGs. While ECG situations have numerous similarities,
little attention has been paid to categorizing ECGs using graph neural
networks. In this study, we offer three distinct techniques for classifying
heartbeats using deep graph neural networks to classify the ECG signals
accurately. We suggest using different methods to extract topological features
from the ECG signal and then using a branch of the graph neural network named
graph isomorphism network for classifying the ECGs. On the PTB Diagnostics data
set, we tested the three proposed techniques. According to the findings, the
three proposed techniques are capable of making arrhythmia classification
predictions with the accuracy of 99.38, 98.76, and 91.93 percent, respectively.

<title>Exploring Best Practices for ECG Signal Processing in Machine Learning. (arXiv:2311.04229v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04229</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work we search for best practices in pre-processing of
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in order to train better classifiers for the
diagnosis of heart conditions. State of the art machine learning algorithms
have achieved remarkable results in classification of some heart conditions
using ECG data, yet there appears to be no consensus on pre-processing best
practices. Is this lack of consensus due to different conditions and
architectures requiring different processing steps for optimal performance? Is
it possible that state of the art deep-learning models have rendered
pre-processing unnecessary? In this work we apply down-sampling, normalization,
and filtering functions to 3 different multi-label ECG datasets and measure
their effects on 3 different high-performing time-series classifiers. We find
that sampling rates as low as 50Hz can yield comparable results to the commonly
used 500Hz. This is significant as smaller sampling rates will result in
smaller datasets and models, which require less time and resources to train.
Additionally, despite their common usage, we found min-max normalization to be
slightly detrimental overall, and band-passing to make no measurable
difference. We found the blind approach to pre-processing of ECGs for
multi-label classification to be ineffective, with the exception of sample rate
reduction which reliably reduces computational resources, but does not increase
accuracy.

<title>Leveraging sinusoidal representation networks to predict fMRI signals from EEG. (arXiv:2311.04234v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04234</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In modern neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been
a crucial and irreplaceable tool that provides a non-invasive window into the
dynamics of whole-brain activity. Nevertheless, fMRI is limited by hemodynamic
blurring as well as high cost, immobility, and incompatibility with metal
implants. Electroencephalography (EEG) is complementary to fMRI and can
directly record the cortical electrical activity at high temporal resolution,
but has more limited spatial resolution and is unable to recover information
about deep subcortical brain structures. The ability to obtain fMRI information
from EEG would enable cost-effective, imaging across a wider set of brain
regions. Further, beyond augmenting the capabilities of EEG, cross-modality
models would facilitate the interpretation of fMRI signals. However, as both
EEG and fMRI are high-dimensional and prone to artifacts, it is currently
challenging to model fMRI from EEG. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel architecture that can predict fMRI signals directly from multi-channel
EEG without explicit feature engineering. Our model achieves this by
implementing a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to learn frequency
information in brain dynamics from EEG, which serves as the input to a
subsequent encoder-decoder to effectively reconstruct the fMRI signal from a
specific brain region. We evaluate our model using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI
dataset with 8 subjects and investigate its potential for predicting
subcortical fMRI signals. The present results reveal that our model outperforms
a recent state-of-the-art model, and indicates the potential of leveraging
periodic activation functions in deep neural networks to model functional
neuroimaging data.

<title>Can LLMs Follow Simple Rules?. (arXiv:2311.04235v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04235</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed with increasing real-world
responsibilities, it is important to be able to specify and constrain the
behavior of these systems in a reliable manner. Model developers may wish to
set explicit rules for the model, such as &quot;do not generate abusive content&quot;,
but these may be circumvented by jailbreaking techniques. Evaluating how well
LLMs follow developer-provided rules in the face of adversarial inputs
typically requires manual review, which slows down monitoring and methods
development. To address this issue, we propose Rule-following Language
Evaluation Scenarios (RuLES), a programmatic framework for measuring
rule-following ability in LLMs. RuLES consists of 15 simple text scenarios in
which the model is instructed to obey a set of rules in natural language while
interacting with the human user. Each scenario has a concise evaluation program
to determine whether the model has broken any rules in a conversation. Through
manual exploration of model behavior in our scenarios, we identify 6 categories
of attack strategies and collect two suites of test cases: one consisting of
unique conversations from manual testing and one that systematically implements
strategies from the 6 categories. Across various popular proprietary and open
models such as GPT-4 and Llama 2, we find that all models are susceptible to a
wide variety of adversarial hand-crafted user inputs, though GPT-4 is the
best-performing model. Additionally, we evaluate open models under
gradient-based attacks and find significant vulnerabilities. We propose RuLES
as a challenging new setting for research into exploring and defending against
both manual and automatic attacks on LLMs.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04236</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of wearable sensor technologies holds substantial promise
for the field of personalized and context-aware Human Activity Recognition.
Given the inherently decentralized nature of data sources within this domain,
the utilization of multi-agent systems with their inherent decentralization
capabilities presents an opportunity to facilitate the development of scalable,
adaptable, and privacy-conscious methodologies. This paper introduces a
collaborative distributed learning approach rooted in multi-agent principles,
wherein individual users of sensor-equipped devices function as agents within a
distributed network, collectively contributing to the comprehensive process of
learning and classifying human activities. In this proposed methodology, not
only is the privacy of activity monitoring data upheld for each individual,
eliminating the need for an external server to oversee the learning process,
but the system also exhibits the potential to surmount the limitations of
conventional centralized models and adapt to the unique attributes of each
user. The proposed approach has been empirically tested on two publicly
accessible human activity recognition datasets, specifically PAMAP2 and HARTH,
across varying settings. The provided empirical results conclusively highlight
the efficacy of inter-individual collaborative learning when contrasted with
centralized configurations, both in terms of local and global generalization.

<title>Online Learning Quantum States with the Logarithmic Loss via VB-FTRL. (arXiv:2311.04237v1 [quant-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04237</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Online learning quantum states with the logarithmic loss (LL-OLQS) is a
quantum generalization of online portfolio selection, a classic open problem in
the field of online learning for over three decades. The problem also emerges
in designing randomized optimization algorithms for maximum-likelihood quantum
state tomography. Recently, Jezequel et al. (&lt;a href=&quot;/abs/2209.13932&quot;&gt;arXiv:2209.13932&lt;/a&gt;) proposed the
VB-FTRL algorithm, the first nearly regret-optimal algorithm for OPS with
moderate computational complexity. In this note, we generalize VB-FTRL for
LL-OLQS. Let $d$ denote the dimension and $T$ the number of rounds. The
generalized algorithm achieves a regret rate of $O ( d^2 \log ( d + T ) )$ for
LL-OLQS. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of solving a semidefinite
program that can be implemented in polynomial time by, e.g., cutting-plane
methods. For comparison, the best-known regret rate for LL-OLQS is currently $O
( d^2 \log T )$, achieved by the exponential weight method. However, there is
no explicit implementation available for the exponential weight method for
LL-OLQS. To facilitate the generalization, we introduce the notion of
VB-convexity. VB-convexity is a sufficient condition for the logarithmic
barrier associated with any function to be convex and is of independent
interest.

<title>Kindness in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2311.04239v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04239</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In human societies, people often incorporate fairness in their decisions and
treat reciprocally by being kind to those who act kindly. They evaluate the
kindness of others&apos; actions not only by monitoring the outcomes but also by
considering the intentions. This behavioral concept can be adapted to train
cooperative agents in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We propose the
KindMARL method, where agents&apos; intentions are measured by counterfactual
reasoning over the environmental impact of the actions that were available to
the agents. More specifically, the current environment state is compared with
the estimation of the current environment state provided that the agent had
chosen another action. The difference between each agent&apos;s reward, as the
outcome of its action, with that of its fellow, multiplied by the intention of
the fellow is then taken as the fellow&apos;s &quot;kindness&quot;. If the result of each
reward-comparison confirms the agent&apos;s superiority, it perceives the fellow&apos;s
kindness and reduces its own reward. Experimental results in the Cleanup and
Harvest environments show that training based on the KindMARL method enabled
the agents to earn 89\% (resp. 37\%) and 44% (resp. 43\%) more total rewards
than training based on the Inequity Aversion and Social Influence methods. The
effectiveness of KindMARL is further supported by experiments in a traffic
light control problem.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;To promote cooperation and strengthen the individual impact on the collective
outcome in social dilemmas, we propose the Environmental-impact Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (EMuReL) method where each agent estimates the
&quot;environmental impact&quot; of every other agent, that is, the difference in the
current environment state compared to the hypothetical environment in the
absence of that other agent. Inspired by the Inequity Aversion model, the agent
then compares its own reward with those of its fellows multiplied by their
environmental impacts. If its reward exceeds the scaled reward of one of its
fellows, the agent takes &quot;social responsibility&quot; toward that fellow by reducing
its own reward. Therefore, the less influential an agent is in reaching the
current state, the more social responsibility is taken by other agents.
Experiments in the Cleanup (resp. Harvest) test environment demonstrate that
agents trained based on EMuReL learn to cooperate more effectively and obtain
$54\%$ ($39\%$) and $20\%$ ($44\%$) more total rewards while preserving the
same cooperation levels compared to when they are trained based on the two

influence.

this article, we have provided some fundamentals of RIS deployment in theory

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The strength of a supply chain is an important measure of a country&apos;s or
region&apos;s technical advancement and overall competitiveness. Establishing supply
chain risk assessment models for effective management and mitigation of
potential risks has become increasingly crucial. As the number of businesses
grows, the important relationships become more complicated and difficult to
measure. This emphasizes the need of extracting relevant information from graph
data. Previously, academics mostly employed knowledge inference to increase the
visibility of links between nodes in the supply chain. However, they have not
solved the data hunger problem of single node feature characteristics. We
propose a hierarchical knowledge transferable graph neural network-based
(HKTGNN) supply chain risk assessment model to address these issues. Our
approach is based on current graph embedding methods for assessing corporate
investment risk assessment. We embed the supply chain network corresponding to
individual goods in the supply chain using the graph embedding module,
resulting in a directed homogeneous graph with just product nodes. This reduces
the complicated supply chain network into a basic product network. It addresses
difficulties using the domain difference knowledge transferable module based on
centrality, which is presented by the premise that supply chain feature
characteristics may be biased in the actual world. Meanwhile, the feature
complement and message passing will alleviate the data hunger problem, which is
driven by domain differences. Our model outperforms in experiments on a
real-world supply chain dataset. We will give an equation to prove that our
comparative experiment is both effective and fair.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been a rapid development of spatio-temporal
prediction techniques in response to the increasing demands of traffic
management and travel planning. While advanced end-to-end models have achieved
notable success in improving predictive performance, their integration and
expansion pose significant challenges. This work aims to address these
challenges by introducing a spatio-temporal pre-training framework that
seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance.
The framework is built upon two key designs: (i) We propose a spatio-temporal
mask autoencoder as a pre-training model for learning spatio-temporal
dependencies. The model incorporates customized parameter learners and
hierarchical spatial pattern encoding networks. These modules are specifically
designed to capture spatio-temporal customized representations and intra- and
inter-cluster region semantic relationships, which have often been neglected in
existing approaches. (ii) We introduce an adaptive mask strategy as part of the
pre-training mechanism. This strategy guides the mask autoencoder in learning
robust spatio-temporal representations and facilitates the modeling of
different relationships, ranging from intra-cluster to inter-cluster, in an
easy-to-hard training manner. Extensive experiments conducted on representative
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We have made
our model implementation publicly available at https://github.com/HKUDS/GPT-ST.

<title>Analysis and Applications of Deep Learning with Finite Samples in Full Life-Cycle Intelligence of Nuclear Power Generation. (arXiv:2311.04247v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04247</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The advent of Industry 4.0 has precipitated the incorporation of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) methods within industrial contexts, aiming to realize
intelligent manufacturing, operation as well as maintenance, also known as
industrial intelligence. However, intricate industrial milieus, particularly
those relating to energy exploration and production, frequently encompass data
characterized by long-tailed class distribution, sample imbalance, and domain
shift. These attributes pose noteworthy challenges to data-centric Deep
Learning (DL) techniques, crucial for the realization of industrial
intelligence. The present study centers on the intricate and distinctive
industrial scenarios of Nuclear Power Generation (NPG), meticulously
scrutinizing the application of DL techniques under the constraints of finite
data samples. Initially, the paper expounds on potential employment scenarios
for AI across the full life-cycle of NPG. Subsequently, we delve into an
evaluative exposition of DL&apos;s advancement, grounded in the finite sample
perspective. This encompasses aspects such as small-sample learning, few-shot
learning, zero-shot learning, and open-set recognition, also referring to the
unique data characteristics of NPG. The paper then proceeds to present two
specific case studies. The first revolves around the automatic recognition of
zirconium alloy metallography, while the second pertains to open-set
recognition for signal diagnosis of machinery sensors. These cases, spanning
the entirety of NPG&apos;s life-cycle, are accompanied by constructive outcomes and
insightful deliberations. By exploring and applying DL methodologies within the
constraints of finite sample availability, this paper not only furnishes a
robust technical foundation but also introduces a fresh perspective toward the
secure and efficient advancement and exploitation of this advanced energy
source.

<title>Unifying Structure and Language Semantic for Efficient Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion with Structured Entity Anchors. (arXiv:2311.04250v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04250</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The goal of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is to predict missing links in a
KG using trained facts that are already known. In recent, pre-trained language
model (PLM) based methods that utilize both textual and structural information
are emerging, but their performances lag behind state-of-the-art (SOTA)
structure-based methods or some methods lose their inductive inference
capabilities in the process of fusing structure embedding to text encoder. In
this paper, we propose a novel method to effectively unify structure
information and language semantics without losing the power of inductive
reasoning. We adopt entity anchors and these anchors and textual description of
KG elements are fed together into the PLM-based encoder to learn unified
representations. In addition, the proposed method utilizes additional random
negative samples which can be reused in the each mini-batch during contrastive
learning to learn a generalized entity representations. We verify the
effectiveness of the our proposed method through various experiments and
analysis. The experimental results on standard benchmark widely used in link
prediction task show that the proposed model outperforms existing the SOTA KGC
models. Especially, our method show the largest performance improvement on
FB15K-237, which is competitive to the SOTA of structure-based KGC methods.

<title>MixtureGrowth: Growing Neural Networks by Recombining Learned Parameters. (arXiv:2311.04251v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04251</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Most deep neural networks are trained under fixed network architectures and
require retraining when the architecture changes. If expanding the network&apos;s
size is needed, it is necessary to retrain from scratch, which is expensive. To
avoid this, one can grow from a small network by adding random weights over
time to gradually achieve the target network size. However, this naive approach
falls short in practice as it brings too much noise to the growing process.
Prior work tackled this issue by leveraging the already learned weights and
training data for generating new weights through conducting a computationally
expensive analysis step. In this paper, we introduce MixtureGrowth, a new
approach to growing networks that circumvents the initialization overhead in
prior work. Before growing, each layer in our model is generated with a linear
combination of parameter templates. Newly grown layer weights are generated by
using a new linear combination of existing templates for a layer. On one hand,
these templates are already trained for the task, providing a strong
initialization. On the other, the new coefficients provide flexibility for the
added layer weights to learn something new. We show that our approach boosts
top-1 accuracy over the state-of-the-art by 2-2.5% on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets, while achieving comparable performance with fewer FLOPs to a larger
network trained from scratch. Code is available at

<title>CNN-Based Structural Damage Detection using Time-Series Sensor Data. (arXiv:2311.04252v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04252</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for evaluating structural
condition, aiming to detect damage through sensor data analysis. It aligns with
predictive maintenance in modern industry, minimizing downtime and costs by
addressing potential structural issues. Various machine learning techniques
have been used to extract valuable information from vibration data, often
relying on prior structural knowledge. This research introduces an innovative
approach to structural damage detection, utilizing a new Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) algorithm. In order to extract deep spatial features from time
series data, CNNs are taught to recognize long-term temporal connections. This
methodology combines spatial and temporal features, enhancing discrimination
capabilities when compared to methods solely reliant on deep spatial features.
Time series data are divided into two categories using the proposed neural
network: undamaged and damaged. To validate its efficacy, the method&apos;s accuracy
was tested using a benchmark dataset derived from a three-floor structure at
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The outcomes show that the new CNN
algorithm is very accurate in spotting structural degradation in the examined
structure.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04253</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigate federated edge learning over a fading multiple
access channel. To alleviate the communication burden between the edge devices
and the access point, we introduce a pioneering digital over-the-air
computation strategy employing q-ary quadrature amplitude modulation,
culminating in a low latency communication scheme. Indeed, we propose a new
federated edge learning framework in which edge devices use digital modulation
for over-the-air uplink transmission to the edge server while they have no
access to the channel state information. Furthermore, we incorporate multiple
antennas at the edge server to overcome the fading inherent in wireless
communication. We analyze the number of antennas required to mitigate the
fading impact effectively. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for the mean
squared error for the proposed federated learning with digital over-the-air
uplink transmissions under both noisy and fading conditions. Leveraging the
derived upper bound, we characterize the convergence rate of the learning
process of a non-convex loss function in terms of the mean square error of
gradients due to the fading channel. Furthermore, we substantiate the
theoretical assurances through numerical experiments concerning mean square
error and the convergence efficacy of the digital federated edge learning
framework. Notably, the results demonstrate that augmenting the number of
antennas at the edge server and adopting higher-order modulations improve the
model accuracy up to 60\%.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized
decision-making by breaking down complex problems into more manageable language
sequences referred to as ``thoughts&apos;&apos;. An effective thought design should
consider three key perspectives: performance, efficiency, and flexibility.
However, existing thought can at most exhibit two of these attributes. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel thought prompting approach
called ``Everything of Thoughts&apos;&apos; (XoT) to defy the law of ``Penrose triangle
of existing thought paradigms. XoT leverages pretrained reinforcement learning
and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incorporate external domain knowledge
into thoughts, thereby enhancing LLMs&apos; capabilities and enabling them to
generalize to unseen problems efficiently. Through the utilization of the
MCTS-LLM collaborative thought revision framework, this approach autonomously
produces high-quality comprehensive cognitive mappings with minimal LLM
interactions. Additionally, XoT empowers LLMs to engage in unconstrained

<title>IoT-Based Environmental Control System for Fish Farms with Sensor Integration and Machine Learning Decision Support. (arXiv:2311.04258v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04258</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In response to the burgeoning global demand for seafood and the challenges of
managing fish farms, we introduce an innovative IoT based environmental control
system that integrates sensor technology and advanced machine learning decision
support. Deploying a network of wireless sensors within the fish farm, we
continuously collect real-time data on crucial environmental parameters,
including water temperature, pH levels, humidity, and fish behavior. This data
undergoes meticulous preprocessing to ensure its reliability, including
imputation, outlier detection, feature engineering, and synchronization. At the
heart of our system are four distinct machine learning algorithms: Random
Forests predict and optimize water temperature and pH levels for the fish,
fostering their health and growth; Support Vector Machines (SVMs) function as
an early warning system, promptly detecting diseases and parasites in fish;
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) dynamically fine-tune the feeding schedule
based on real-time environmental conditions, promoting resource efficiency and
fish productivity; Neural Networks manage the operation of critical equipment
like water pumps and heaters to maintain the desired environmental conditions
within the farm. These machine learning algorithms collaboratively make
real-time decisions to ensure that the fish farm&apos;s environmental conditions
align with predefined specifications, leading to improved fish health and
productivity while simultaneously reducing resource wastage, thereby
contributing to increased profitability and sustainability. This research
article showcases the power of data-driven decision support in fish farming,
promising to meet the growing demand for seafood while emphasizing
environmental responsibility and economic viability, thus revolutionizing the
future of fish farming.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) have been proposed, advocated, and
generated for more than 25 years. Although ETDs are hosted by commercial or
institutional digital library repositories, they are still an understudied type
of scholarly big data, partially because they are usually longer than
conference proceedings and journals. Segmenting ETDs will allow researchers to
study sectional content. Readers can navigate to particular pages of interest,
discover, and explore the content buried in these long documents. Most existing
frameworks on document page classification are designed for classifying general
documents and perform poorly on ETDs. In this paper, we propose ETDPC. Its
backbone is a two-stream multimodal model with a cross-attention network to
classify ETD pages into 13 categories. To overcome the challenge of imbalanced
labeled samples, we augmented data for minority categories and employed a
hierarchical classifier. ETDPC outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all
categories, achieving an F1 of 0.84 -- 0.96 for 9 out of 13 categories. We also
demonstrated its data efficiency. The code and data can be found on GitHub

<title>Compilation of product-formula Hamiltonian simulation via reinforcement learning. (arXiv:2311.04285v1 [quant-ph])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04285</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hamiltonian simulation is believed to be one of the first tasks where quantum
computers can yield a quantum advantage. One of the most popular methods of
Hamiltonian simulation is Trotterization, which makes use of the approximation
$e^{i\sum_jA_j}\sim \prod_je^{iA_j}$ and higher-order corrections thereto.
However, this leaves open the question of the order of operations (i.e. the
order of the product over $j$, which is known to affect the quality of
approximation). In some cases this order is fixed by the desire to minimise the
error of approximation; when it is not the case, we propose that the order can
be chosen to optimize compilation to a native quantum architecture. This
presents a new compilation problem -- order-agnostic quantum circuit
compilation -- which we prove is NP-hard in the worst case. In lieu of an
easily-computable exact solution, we turn to methods of heuristic optimization
of compilation. We focus on reinforcement learning due to the sequential nature
of the compilation task, comparing it to simulated annealing and Monte Carlo
tree search. While two of the methods outperform a naive heuristic,
reinforcement learning clearly outperforms all others, with a gain of around
12% with respect to the second-best method and of around 50% compared to the
naive heuristic in terms of the gate count. We further test the ability of RL
to generalize across instances of the compilation problem, and find that a
single learner is able to solve entire problem families. This demonstrates the
ability of machine learning techniques to provide assistance in an
order-agnostic quantum compilation task.

<title>Lie Point Symmetry and Physics Informed Networks. (arXiv:2311.04293v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04293</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Symmetries have been leveraged to improve the generalization of neural
networks through different mechanisms from data augmentation to equivariant
architectures. However, despite their potential, their integration into neural
solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) remains largely unexplored.
We explore the integration of PDE symmetries, known as Lie point symmetries, in
a major family of neural solvers known as physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs). We propose a loss function that informs the network about Lie point
symmetries in the same way that PINN models try to enforce the underlying PDE
through a loss function. Intuitively, our symmetry loss ensures that the
infinitesimal generators of the Lie group conserve the PDE solutions.
Effectively, this means that once the network learns a solution, it also learns
the neighbouring solutions generated by Lie point symmetries. Empirical
evaluations indicate that the inductive bias introduced by the Lie point
symmetries of the PDEs greatly boosts the sample efficiency of PINNs.

<title>Class-Incremental Continual Learning for General Purpose Healthcare Models. (arXiv:2311.04301v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04301</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Healthcare clinics regularly encounter dynamic data that changes due to
variations in patient populations, treatment policies, medical devices, and
emerging disease patterns. Deep learning models can suffer from catastrophic
forgetting when fine-tuned in such scenarios, causing poor performance on
previously learned tasks. Continual learning allows learning on new tasks
without performance drop on previous tasks. In this work, we investigate the
performance of continual learning models on four different medical imaging
scenarios involving ten classification datasets from diverse modalities,
clinical specialties, and hospitals. We implement various continual learning
approaches and evaluate their performance in these scenarios. Our results
demonstrate that a single model can sequentially learn new tasks from different
specialties and achieve comparable performance to naive methods. These findings
indicate the feasibility of recycling or sharing models across the same or
different medical specialties, offering another step towards the development of
general-purpose medical imaging AI that can be shared across institutions.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm to conduct
collaborative learning among clients on a joint model. The primary goal is to
share clients&apos; local training parameters with an integrating server while
preserving their privacy. This method permits to exploit the potential of
massive mobile users&apos; data for the benefit of machine learning models&apos;
performance while keeping sensitive data on local devices. On the downside, FL
raises security and privacy concerns that have just started to be studied. To
address some of the key threats in FL, researchers have proposed to use secure
aggregation methods (e.g. homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty
computation, etc.). These solutions improve some security and privacy metrics,
but at the same time bring about other serious threats such as poisoning
attacks, backdoor attacks, and free running attacks. This paper proposes a new
defense method against poisoning attacks in FL called SaFL (Sybil-aware
Federated Learning) that minimizes the effect of sybils with a novel
time-variant aggregation scheme.

<title>Device Sampling and Resource Optimization for Federated Learning in Cooperative Edge Networks. (arXiv:2311.04350v1 [cs.NI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04350</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The conventional federated learning (FedL) architecture distributes machine
learning (ML) across worker devices by having them train local models that are
periodically aggregated by a server. FedL ignores two important characteristics
of contemporary wireless networks, however: (i) the network may contain
heterogeneous communication/computation resources, and (ii) there may be
significant overlaps in devices&apos; local data distributions. In this work, we
develop a novel optimization methodology that jointly accounts for these
factors via intelligent device sampling complemented by device-to-device (D2D)
offloading. Our optimization methodology aims to select the best combination of
sampled nodes and data offloading configuration to maximize FedL training
accuracy while minimizing data processing and D2D communication resource
consumption subject to realistic constraints on the network topology and device
capabilities. Theoretical analysis of the D2D offloading subproblem leads to
new FedL convergence bounds and an efficient sequential convex optimizer. Using
these results, we develop a sampling methodology based on graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) which learns the relationship between network attributes,
sampled nodes, and D2D data offloading to maximize FedL accuracy. Through
evaluation on popular datasets and real-world network measurements from our
edge testbed, we find that our methodology outperforms popular device sampling
methodologies from literature in terms of ML model performance, data processing
overhead, and energy consumption.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the modern era, malware is experiencing a significant increase in both its
variety and quantity, aligning with the widespread adoption of the digital
world. This surge in malware has emerged as a critical challenge in the realm
of cybersecurity, prompting numerous research endeavors and contributions to
address the issue. Machine learning algorithms have been leveraged for malware
detection due to their ability to uncover concealed patterns within vast
datasets. However, deep learning algorithms, characterized by their
multi-layered structure, surpass the limitations of traditional machine
learning approaches. By employing deep learning techniques such as CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), this study
aims to classify and identify malware extracted from a dataset containing API
call sequences. The performance of these algorithms is compared with that of
conventional machine learning methods, including SVM (Support Vector Machine),
RF (Random Forest), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting),
and GBC (Gradient Boosting Classifier), all using the same dataset. The
outcomes of this research demonstrate that both deep learning and machine

<title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models. (arXiv:2311.04378v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal
(watermark) in a model&apos;s output so that it can be later verified that the
output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies
the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark
without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the
(im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under
well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to
achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the
watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the
attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark
attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or
even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The
attacker has access to a &quot;quality oracle&quot; that can evaluate whether a candidate
output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access
to a &quot;perturbation oracle&quot; which can modify an output with a nontrivial
probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing
random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be
satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities
than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box
access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over
time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing
watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023),
Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully
removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality
degradation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Certifiable, adaptive uncertainty estimates for unknown quantities are an
essential ingredient of sequential decision-making algorithms. Standard
approaches rely on problem-dependent concentration results and are limited to a
specific combination of parameterization, noise family, and estimator. In this
paper, we revisit the likelihood-based inference principle and propose to use
likelihood ratios to construct any-time valid confidence sequences without
requiring specialized treatment in each application scenario. Our method is
especially suitable for problems with well-specified likelihoods, and the
resulting sets always maintain the prescribed coverage in a model-agnostic
manner. The size of the sets depends on a choice of estimator sequence in the
likelihood ratio. We discuss how to provably choose the best sequence of
estimators and shed light on connections to online convex optimization with
algorithms such as Follow-the-Regularized-Leader. To counteract the initially
large bias of the estimators, we propose a reweighting scheme that also opens
up deployment in non-parametric settings such as RKHS function classes. We
provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the likelihood ratio confidence sets size
for generalized linear models, using insights from convex duality and online
learning. We showcase the practical strength of our method on generalized
linear bandit problems, survival analysis, and bandits with various additive

<title>Data Factors for Better Compositional Generalization. (arXiv:2311.04420v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04420</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent diagnostic datasets on compositional generalization, such as SCAN
(Lake and Baroni, 2018) and COGS (Kim and Linzen, 2020), expose severe problems
in models trained from scratch on these datasets. However, in contrast to this
poor performance, state-of-the-art models trained on larger and more general
datasets show better generalization ability. In this work, to reconcile this
inconsistency, we conduct an empirical analysis by training Transformer models
on a variety of training sets with different data factors, including dataset
scale, pattern complexity, example difficulty, etc. First, we show that
increased dataset complexity can lead to better generalization behavior on
multiple different generalization challenges. To further understand this
improvement, we show two axes of the benefit from more complex datasets: they
provide more diverse examples so compositional understanding becomes more
effective, and they also prevent ungeneralizable memorization of the examples
due to reduced example repetition frequency. Finally, we explore how training
examples of different difficulty levels influence generalization differently.
On synthetic datasets, simple examples invoke stronger compositionality than
hard examples do. On larger-scale real language datasets, while hard examples
become more important potentially to ensure decent data coverage, a balanced
mixture of simple and hard examples manages to induce the strongest
generalizability. The code and data for this work are available at

<title>A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space. (arXiv:2311.04434v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04434</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing
transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images
or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for
massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are
ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical
simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based
services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for
massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including
implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in
continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high
computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points,
and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To
address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer
model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a
quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation.
We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction
confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a
theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs.
Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our
method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can
scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU. The code is available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04441</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Semi-supervised entity alignment (EA) is a practical and challenging task
because of the lack of adequate labeled mappings as training data. Most works
address this problem by generating pseudo mappings for unlabeled entities.
However, they either suffer from the erroneous (noisy) pseudo mappings or
largely ignore the uncertainty of pseudo mappings. In this paper, we propose a
novel semi-supervised EA method, termed as MixTEA, which guides the model
learning with an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and
probabilistic pseudo mappings. We firstly train a student model using few
labeled mappings as standard. More importantly, in pseudo mapping learning, we
propose a bi-directional voting (BDV) strategy that fuses the alignment
decisions in different directions to estimate the uncertainty via the joint
matching confidence score. Meanwhile, we also design a matching diversity-based
rectification (MDR) module to adjust the pseudo mapping learning, thus reducing
the negative influence of noisy mappings. Extensive results on benchmark
datasets as well as further analyses demonstrate the superiority and the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

<title>Recursion in Recursion: Two-Level Nested Recursion for Length Generalization with Scalability. (arXiv:2311.04449v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04449</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Binary Balanced Tree RvNNs (BBT-RvNNs) enforce sequence composition according
to a preset balanced binary tree structure. Thus, their non-linear recursion
depth is just $\log_2 n$ ($n$ being the sequence length). Such logarithmic
scaling makes BBT-RvNNs efficient and scalable on long sequence tasks such as
Long Range Arena (LRA). However, such computational efficiency comes at a cost
because BBT-RvNNs cannot solve simple arithmetic tasks like ListOps. On the
flip side, RvNNs (e.g., Beam Tree RvNN) that do succeed on ListOps (and other
structure-sensitive tasks like formal logical inference) are generally several
times more expensive than even RNNs. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework -- Recursion in Recursion (RIR) to strike a balance between the two
sides - getting some of the benefits from both worlds. In RIR, we use a form of
two-level nested recursion - where the outer recursion is a $k$-ary balanced
tree model with another recursive model (inner recursion) implementing its cell
function. For the inner recursion, we choose Beam Tree RvNNs (BT-RvNN). To
adjust BT-RvNNs within RIR we also propose a novel strategy of beam alignment.
Overall, this entails that the total recursive depth in RIR is upper-bounded by
$k \log_k n$. Our best RIR-based model is the first model that demonstrates
high ($\geq 90\%$) length-generalization performance on ListOps while at the
same time being scalable enough to be trainable on long sequence inputs from
LRA. Moreover, in terms of accuracy in the LRA language tasks, it performs
competitively with Structured State Space Models (SSMs) without any special
initialization - outperforming Transformers by a large margin. On the other
hand, while SSMs can marginally outperform RIR on LRA, they (SSMs) fail to
length-generalize on ListOps. Our code is available at:

<title>Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification approaches for Neural PDEs in scientific applications. (arXiv:2311.04457v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04457</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of spatially distributed data, enabled by affordable
sensors, field, and numerical experiments, has facilitated the development of
data-driven solutions for scientific problems, including climate change,
weather prediction, and urban planning. Neural Partial Differential Equations
(Neural PDEs), which combine deep learning (DL) techniques with domain
expertise (e.g., governing equations) for parameterization, have proven to be
effective in capturing valuable correlations within spatiotemporal datasets.
However, sparse and noisy measurements coupled with modeling approximation
introduce aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Therefore, quantifying
uncertainties propagated from model inputs to outputs remains a challenge and
an essential goal for establishing the trustworthiness of Neural PDEs. This
work evaluates various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) approaches for both
Forward and Inverse Problems in scientific applications. Specifically, we
investigate the effectiveness of Bayesian methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and a more conventional approach,
Deep Ensembles (DE). To illustrate their performance, we take two canonical
PDEs: Burger&apos;s equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. Our results indicate
that Neural PDEs can effectively reconstruct flow systems and predict the
associated unknown parameters. However, it is noteworthy that the results
derived from Bayesian methods, based on our observations, tend to display a
higher degree of certainty in their predictions as compared to those obtained
using the DE. This elevated certainty in predictions suggests that Bayesian
techniques might underestimate the true underlying uncertainty, thereby
appearing more confident in their predictions than the DE approach.

<title>Solving High Frequency and Multi-Scale PDEs with Gaussian Processes. (arXiv:2311.04465v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04465</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine learning based solvers have garnered much attention in physical
simulation and scientific computing, with a prominent example, physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs). However, PINNs often struggle to solve high-frequency
and multi-scale PDEs, which can be due to spectral bias during neural network
training. To address this problem, we resort to the Gaussian process (GP)
framework. To flexibly capture the dominant frequencies, we model the power
spectrum of the PDE solution with a student t mixture or Gaussian mixture. We
then apply the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the covariance function
(according to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem). The covariance derived from the
Gaussian mixture spectrum corresponds to the known spectral mixture kernel. We
are the first to discover its rationale and effectiveness for PDE solving.
Next,we estimate the mixture weights in the log domain, which we show is
equivalent to placing a Jeffreys prior. It automatically induces sparsity,
prunes excessive frequencies, and adjusts the remaining toward the ground
truth. Third, to enable efficient and scalable computation on massive
collocation points, which are critical to capture high frequencies, we place
the collocation points on a grid, and multiply our covariance function at each
input dimension. We use the GP conditional mean to predict the solution and its
derivatives so as to fit the boundary condition and the equation itself. As a
result, we can derive a Kronecker product structure in the covariance matrix.
We use Kronecker product properties and multilinear algebra to greatly promote
computational efficiency and scalability, without any low-rank approximations.
We show the advantage of our method in systematic experiments.

design, and development efforts in the aerial autonomy space. However, it is
highly challenging to concurrently operationalize all types of aerial vehicles
that are operating fully autonomously sharing the airspace. Full autonomy of
the aerial transportation sector includes several aspects, such as design of
the technology that powers the vehicles, operations of multi-agent fleets, and
process of certification that meets stringent safety requirements of aviation
sector. Thereby, Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility is still a vague term and
its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address
this gap, we present a comprehensive perspective on the emerging field of
autonomous advanced aerial mobility, which involves the use of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for
various applications, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, and

consisting of four main blocks: sensing, perception, planning, and controls.
Furthermore, the article discusses the challenges and opportunities in
multi-agent fleet operations and management, as well as the testing,
validation, and certification aspects of autonomous aerial systems. Finally,
the article explores the potential of monolithic models for aerial autonomy and

gradually reducing the capacity of the network through dropout during the
training process. These methods enable the model to learn more robust and
generalizable features. Moreover, CLearViD leverages the Mish activation

the issue of vanishing gradients. Our extensive experiments and ablation

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art deep learning models for tabular data have recently achieved
acceptable performance to be deployed in industrial settings. However, the
robustness of these models remains scarcely explored. Contrary to computer
vision, there is to date no realistic protocol to properly evaluate the
adversarial robustness of deep tabular models due to intrinsic properties of
tabular data such as categorical features, immutability, and feature
relationship constraints. To fill this gap, we propose CAA, the first efficient
evasion attack for constrained tabular deep learning models. CAA is an
iterative parameter-free attack that combines gradient and search attacks to
generate adversarial examples under constraints. We leverage CAA to build a
benchmark of deep tabular models across three popular use cases: credit
scoring, phishing and botnet attacks detection. Our benchmark supports ten
threat models with increasing capabilities of the attacker, and reflects
real-world attack scenarios for each use case. Overall, our results demonstrate
how domain knowledge, adversarial training, and attack budgets impact the
robustness assessment of deep tabular models and provide security practitioners
with a set of recommendations to improve the robustness of deep tabular models
against various evasion attack scenarios.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04511</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation is an idealized model representing
many stochastic systems commonly encountered in the analysis of stochastic
structures as well as many other applications. Its solution thus provides an
invaluable insight into the performance of many engineering systems. Despite
its great importance, the solution of the FPK equation is still extremely
challenging. For systems of practical significance, the FPK equation is usually
high dimensional, rendering most of the numerical methods ineffective. In this
respect, the present work introduces the FPK-DP Net as a physics-informed
network that encodes the physical insights, i.e. the governing constrained
differential equations emanated out of physical laws, into a deep neural
network. FPK-DP Net is a mesh-free learning method that can solve the density
evolution of stochastic dynamics subjected to additive white Gaussian noise
without any prior simulation data and can be used as an efficient surrogate
model afterward. FPK-DP Net uses the dimension-reduced FPK equation. Therefore,
it can be used to address high-dimensional practical problems as well. To
demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed framework, and to study
its accuracy and efficacy, numerical implementations on five different
benchmark problems are investigated.

<title>Towards Democratizing AI: A Comparative Analysis of AI as a Service Platforms and the Open Space for Machine Learning Approach. (arXiv:2311.04518v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04518</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent AI research has significantly reduced the barriers to apply AI, but
the process of setting up the necessary tools and frameworks can still be a
challenge. While AI-as-a-Service platforms have emerged to simplify the
training and deployment of AI models, they still fall short of achieving true
democratization of AI. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by comparing
several popular AI-as-a-Service platforms and identifying the key requirements
for a platform that can achieve true democratization of AI. Our analysis
highlights the need for self-hosting options, high scalability, and openness.
To address these requirements, we propose our approach: the &quot;Open Space for
Machine Learning&quot; platform. Our platform is built on cutting-edge technologies
such as Kubernetes, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Ludwig, enabling us to overcome the
challenges of democratizing AI. We argue that our approach is more
comprehensive and effective in meeting the requirements of democratizing AI
than existing AI-as-a-Service platforms.

<title>Adaptive Mirror Descent Bilevel Optimization. (arXiv:2311.04520v1 [math.OC])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04520</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the paper, we propose a class of efficient adaptive bilevel methods based
on mirror descent for nonconvex bilevel optimization, where its upper-level
problem is nonconvex possibly with nonsmooth regularization, and its
lower-level problem is also nonconvex while satisfies Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
(PL) condition. To solve these deterministic bilevel problems, we present an
efficient adaptive projection-aid gradient (i.e., AdaPAG) method based on
mirror descent, and prove that it obtains the best known gradient complexity of
$O(\epsilon^{-1})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of nonconvex
bilevel problems. To solve these stochastic bilevel problems, we propose an
efficient adaptive stochastic projection-aid gradient (i.e., AdaVSPAG) methods
based on mirror descent and variance-reduced techniques, and prove that it
obtains the best known gradient complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ for finding
an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Since the PL condition relaxes the strongly
convex, our algorithms can be used to nonconvex strongly-convex bilevel
optimization. Theoretically, we provide a useful convergence analysis framework
for our methods under some mild conditions, and prove that our methods have a
fast convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{T})$, where $T$ denotes the number of
iterations.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a challenging task that has been
investigated in various domains such as finance investment, health care,

has also limitations that the model is too simple to comprehensively exploit
the characteristics of the dataset. To solve these limitations, we propose
LTSF-DNODE, which applies a model based on linear ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) and a time series decomposition method according to data
statistical characteristics. We show that LTSF-DNODE outperforms the baselines

<title>Bandit Learning to Rank with Position-Based Click Models: Personalized and Equal Treatments. (arXiv:2311.04528v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04528</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Online learning to rank (ONL2R) is a foundational problem for recommender
systems and has received increasing attention in recent years. Among the
existing approaches for ONL2R, a natural modeling architecture is the
multi-armed bandit framework coupled with the position-based click model.
However, developing efficient online learning policies for MAB-based ONL2R with
position-based click models is highly challenging due to the combinatorial
nature of the problem, and partial observability in the position-based click
model. To date, results in MAB-based ONL2R with position-based click models
remain rather limited, which motivates us to fill this gap in this work. Our
main contributions in this work are threefold: i) We propose the first general
MAB framework that captures all key ingredients of ONL2R with position-based
click models. Our model considers personalized and equal treatments in ONL2R
ranking recommendations, both of which are widely used in practice; ii) Based
on the above analytical framework, we develop two unified greed- and UCB-based
policies called GreedyRank and UCBRank, each of which can be applied to
personalized and equal ranking treatments; and iii) We show that both
GreedyRank and UCBRank enjoy $O(\sqrt{t}\ln t)$ and $O(\sqrt{t\ln t})$ anytime
sublinear regret for personalized and equal treatment, respectively. For the
fundamentally hard equal ranking treatment, we identify classes of collective
utility functions and their associated sufficient conditions under which
$O(\sqrt{t}\ln t)$ and $O(\sqrt{t\ln t})$ anytime sublinear regrets are still
achievable for GreedyRank and UCBRank, respectively. Our numerical experiments
also verify our theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of
GreedyRank and UCBRank in seeking the optimal action under various problem
settings.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04531</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful geophysical imaging technique
that infers high-resolution subsurface physical parameters by solving a
non-convex optimization problem. However, due to limitations in observation,
e.g., limited shots or receivers, and random noise, conventional inversion
methods are confronted with numerous challenges, such as the local-minimum
problem. In recent years, a substantial body of work has demonstrated that the
integration of deep neural networks and partial differential equations for
solving full-waveform inversion problems has shown promising performance. In
this work, drawing inspiration from the expressive capacity of neural networks,
we provide an unsupervised learning approach aimed at accurately reconstructing
subsurface physical velocity parameters. This method is founded on a
re-parametrization technique for Bayesian inference, achieved through a deep
neural network with random weights. Notably, our proposed approach does not
hinge upon the requirement of the labeled training dataset, rendering it
exceedingly versatile and adaptable to diverse subsurface models. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed approach performs noticeably better than
existing conventional inversion methods.

<title>Deep Learning Assisted Multiuser MIMO Load Modulated Systems for Enhanced Downlink mmWave Communications. (arXiv:2311.04537v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04537</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper is focused on multiuser load modulation arrays (MU-LMAs) which are
attractive due to their low system complexity and reduced cost for millimeter
wave (mmWave) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. The existing precoding
algorithm for downlink MU-LMA relies on a sub-array structured (SAS)
transmitter which may suffer from decreased degrees of freedom and complex
system configuration. Furthermore, a conventional LMA codebook with codewords
uniformly distributed on a hypersphere may not be channel-adaptive and may lead
to increased signal detection complexity. In this paper, we conceive an MU-LMA
system employing a full-array structured (FAS) transmitter and propose two
algorithms accordingly. The proposed FAS-based system addresses the SAS
structural problems and can support larger numbers of users. For LMA-imposed
constant-power downlink precoding, we propose an FAS-based normalized block
diagonalization (FAS-NBD) algorithm. However, the forced normalization may
result in performance degradation. This degradation, together with the
aforementioned codebook design problems, is difficult to solve analytically.
This motivates us to propose a Deep Learning-enhanced (FAS-DL-NBD) algorithm
for adaptive codebook design and codebook-independent decoding. It is shown
that the proposed algorithms are robust to imperfect knowledge of channel state
information and yield excellent error performance. Moreover, the FAS-DL-NBD
algorithm enables signal detection with low complexity as the number of bits
per codeword increases.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04542</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In settings such as e-recruitment and online dating, recommendation involves
distributing limited opportunities, calling for novel approaches to quantify
and enforce fairness. We introduce \emph{inferiority}, a novel (un)fairness
measure quantifying a user&apos;s competitive disadvantage for their recommended
items. Inferiority complements \emph{envy}, a fairness notion measuring
preference for others&apos; recommendations. We combine inferiority and envy with
\emph{utility}, an accuracy-related measure of aggregated relevancy scores.
Since these measures are non-differentiable, we reformulate them using a
probabilistic interpretation of recommender systems, yielding differentiable
versions. We combine these loss functions in a multi-objective optimization
problem called \texttt{FEIR} (Fairness through Envy and Inferiority Reduction),
applied as post-processing for standard recommender systems. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our approach improves trade-offs
between inferiority, envy, and utility compared to naive recommendations and
the baseline methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning with rejection is an important framework that can refrain from
making predictions to avoid critical mispredictions by balancing between
prediction and rejection. Previous studies on cost-based rejection only focused
on the classification setting, which cannot handle the continuous and infinite
target space in the regression setting. In this paper, we investigate a novel
regression problem called regression with cost-based rejection, where the model
can reject to make predictions on some examples given certain rejection costs.
To solve this problem, we first formulate the expected risk for this problem
and then derive the Bayes optimal solution, which shows that the optimal model
should reject to make predictions on the examples whose variance is larger than
the rejection cost when the mean squared error is used as the evaluation
metric. Furthermore, we propose to train the model by a surrogate loss function
that considers rejection as binary classification and we provide conditions for
the model consistency, which implies that the Bayes optimal solution can be
recovered by our proposed surrogate loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited availability and quantum volume of quantum computers,
quantum image representation is a widely researched area. Currently developed
methods use quantum entanglement to encode information about pixel positions.
These methods range from using the angle parameter of the rotation gate (e.g.,
the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images, FRQI), sequences of qubits
(e.g., Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation, NEQR), or the angle parameter of
the phase shift gates (e.g., Local Phase Image Quantum Encoding, LPIQE) for
storing color information. All these methods are significantly affected by
decoherence and other forms of quantum noise, which is an inseparable part of
quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. These phenomena
can highly influence the measurements and result in extracted images that are
visually dissimilar to the originals. Because this process is at its foundation
quantum, the computational reversal of this process is possible. There are many
methods for error correction, mitigation, and reduction, but all of them use
quantum computer time or additional qubits to achieve the desired result. We
report the successful use of a generative adversarial network trained for
image-to-image translation, in conjunction with Phase Distortion Unraveling
error reduction method, for reducing overall error in images encoded using
LPIQE.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04588</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning (ML) models become vulnerable to Model Stealing Attacks
(MSA) when they are deployed as a service. In such attacks, the deployed model
is queried repeatedly to build a labelled dataset. This dataset allows the
attacker to train a thief model that mimics the original model. To maximize
query efficiency, the attacker has to select the most informative subset of
data points from the pool of available data. Existing attack strategies utilize
approaches like Active Learning and Semi-Supervised learning to minimize costs.
However, in the black-box setting, these approaches may select sub-optimal
samples as they train only one thief model. Depending on the thief model&apos;s
capacity and the data it was pretrained on, the model might even select noisy
samples that harm the learning process. In this work, we explore the usage of
an ensemble of deep learning models as our thief model. We call our attack Army
of Thieves(AOT) as we train multiple models with varying complexities to
leverage the crowd&apos;s wisdom. Based on the ensemble&apos;s collective decision,
uncertain samples are selected for querying, while the most confident samples
are directly included in the training data. Our approach is the first one to
utilize an ensemble of thief models to perform model extraction. We outperform
the base approaches of existing state-of-the-art methods by at least 3% and
achieve a 21% higher adversarial sample transferability than previous work for
models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

their lowest possible value. The rate of decay in topological complexity (as a
metric) helps quantify the impact of architectural choices on the
generalization ability. Interestingly from a representation learning
perspective, we highlight several invariances such as topological invariance of
(1) an architecture on similar datasets; (2) embedding space of a dataset for
architectures of variable depth; (3) embedding space to input resolution/size,
and (4) data sub-sampling. In order to further demonstrate the link between
expressivity \&amp;amp; the generalization capability of a network, we consider the
task of ranking pre-trained models for downstream classification task (transfer
learning). Compared to existing approaches, the proposed metric has a better
correlation to the actually achievable accuracy via fine-tuning the pre-trained
model.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04599</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This study presents an innovative method for predicting the market value of
professional soccer players using explainable machine learning models. Using a
dataset curated from the FIFA website, we employ an ensemble machine learning
approach coupled with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide detailed
explanations of the models&apos; predictions. The GBDT model achieves the highest
mean R-Squared (0.8780) and the lowest mean Root Mean Squared Error
(3,221,632.175), indicating its superior performance among the evaluated
models. Our analysis reveals that specific skills such as ball control, short
passing, finishing, interceptions, dribbling, and tackling are paramount within
the skill dimension, whereas sprint speed and acceleration are critical in the
fitness dimension, and reactions are preeminent in the cognitive dimension. Our
results offer a more accurate, objective, and consistent framework for market
value estimation, presenting useful insights for managerial decisions in player
transfers.

<title>A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Systems with Dynamic User Utility Demands. (arXiv:2311.04600v1 [eess.SP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained a lot
of attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most of the related
studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility
demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed and the designed DL based RA
scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. A
computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters
change. Therefore, in this paper, a DL based resource allocator (ALCOR) is
introduced, which allows users to freely adjust their utility demands based on,
e.g., their application layer. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs), as
the policy, in an iterative optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm
aims to optimize the on-off status of users in a time-sharing problem to
satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained
RA (URA) -- RA without taking into account user utility demands -- among active
users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Based on the
chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in a model-based or model-free manner
and in a centralized or distributed scenario. Derived convergence analyses
provide guarantees for the convergence of ALCOR, and numerical experiments
corroborate its effectiveness.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04604</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Distributed optimization has experienced a significant surge in interest due
to its wide-ranging applications in distributed learning and adaptation. While
various scenarios, such as shared-memory, local-memory, and consensus-based
approaches, have been extensively studied in isolation, there remains a need
for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically
concentrates on a scenario where agents collaborate toward a unified mission
while potentially having distinct tasks. Each agent&apos;s actions can potentially
impact other agents through interactions. Within this context, the objective
for the agents is to optimize their local parameters based on the aggregate of
local reward functions, where only local zeroth-order oracles are available.
Notably, the learning process is asynchronous, meaning that agents update and
query their zeroth-order oracles asynchronously while communicating with other
agents subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper
presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate
for the proposed approach. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant issue of deep
learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts
numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively
train their individual (possibly unique) policies to maximize a common
performance metric.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The path to an autism diagnosis can be long and difficult, and delays can
have serious consequences. Artificial intelligence can completely change the
way autism is diagnosed, especially when it comes to situations where it is
difficult to see the first signs of the disease. AI-based diagnostic tools may
help confirm a diagnosis or highlight the need for further testing by analyzing
large volumes of data and uncovering patterns that may not be immediately
apparent to human evaluators. After a successful and timely diagnosis, autism
can be treated through artificial intelligence using various methods. In this
article, by using four datasets and gathering them with the federated learning
method and diagnosing them with the support vector classifier method, the early
diagnosis of this disorder has been discussed. In this method, we have achieved
99% accuracy for predicting autism spectrum disorder and we have achieved 13%
improvement in the results.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04611</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Robustness to Byzantine attacks is a necessity for various distributed
training scenarios. When the training reduces to the process of solving a
minimization problem, Byzantine robustness is relatively well-understood.
However, other problem formulations, such as min-max problems or, more
generally, variational inequalities, arise in many modern machine learning and,
in particular, distributed learning tasks. These problems significantly differ
from the standard minimization ones and, therefore, require separate
consideration. Nevertheless, only one work (Adibi et al., 2022) addresses this
important question in the context of Byzantine robustness. Our work makes a
further step in this direction by providing several (provably) Byzantine-robust
methods for distributed variational inequality, thoroughly studying their
theoretical convergence, removing the limitations of the previous work, and
providing numerical comparisons supporting the theoretical findings.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a consistent and highly scalable local approach to learn the
causal structure of a linear Gaussian polytree using data from interventional
experiments with known intervention targets. Our methods first learn the
skeleton of the polytree and then orient its edges. The output is a CPDAG

use rely on second order statistics and low-dimensional marginal distributions.
We assess the performance of our methods under different scenarios in synthetic
data sets and apply our algorithm to learn a polytree in a gene expression
interventional data set. Our simulation studies demonstrate that our approach
is fast, has good accuracy in terms of structural Hamming distance, and handles

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Object-centric architectures usually apply a differentiable module to the
entire feature map to decompose it into sets of entity representations called
slots. Some of these methods structurally resemble clustering algorithms, where
the cluster&apos;s center in latent space serves as a slot representation. Slot
Attention is an example of such a method, acting as a learnable analog of the
soft k-means algorithm. Our work employs a learnable clustering method based on
the Gaussian Mixture Model. Unlike other approaches, we represent slots not
only as centers of clusters but also incorporate information about the distance
between clusters and assigned vectors, leading to more expressive slot
representations. Our experiments demonstrate that using this approach instead
of Slot Attention improves performance in object-centric scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art results in the set property prediction task.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The paradigm of Transformers using the self-attention mechanism has
manifested its advantage in learning graph-structured data. Yet, Graph
Transformers are capable of modeling full range dependencies but are often
deficient in extracting information from locality. A common practice is to
utilize Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) as an auxiliary to capture
local information, which however are still inadequate for comprehending
substructures. In this paper, we present a purely attention-based architecture,
namely Focal and Full-Range Graph Transformer (FFGT), which can mitigate the
loss of local information in learning global correlations. The core component
of FFGT is a new mechanism of compound attention, which combines the
conventional full-range attention with K-hop focal attention on ego-nets to
aggregate both global and local information. Beyond the scope of canonical
Transformers, the FFGT has the merit of being more substructure-aware. Our
approach enhances the performance of existing Graph Transformers on various
open datasets, while achieves compatible SOTA performance on several Long-Range
Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets even with a vanilla transformer. We further
examine influential factors on the optimal focal length of attention via
introducing a novel synthetic dataset based on SBM-PATTERN.

<title>Massive Editing for Large Language Models via Meta Learning. (arXiv:2311.04661v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04661</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While large language models (LLMs) have enabled learning knowledge from the
pre-training corpora, the acquired knowledge may be fundamentally incorrect or
outdated over time, which necessitates rectifying the knowledge of the language
model (LM) after the training. A promising approach involves employing a
hyper-network to generate parameter shift, whereas existing hyper-networks
suffer from inferior scalability in synchronous editing operation amount. To
mitigate the problem, we propose the MAssive Language Model Editing Network
(MALMEN), which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square
problem, subsequently updating the LM parameters using the normal equation. To
accommodate editing multiple facts simultaneously with limited memory budgets,
we separate the computation on the hyper-network and LM, enabling arbitrary
batch size on both neural networks. Our method is evaluated by editing up to
thousands of facts on LMs with different architectures, i.e., BERT-base, GPT-2,
T5-XL (2.8B), and GPT-J (6B), across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
i.e., closed book fact-checking and question answering. Remarkably, MALMEN is
capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than strong baselines with the
identical hyper-network architecture and outperforms editor specifically
designed for GPT. Our code is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent
work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and
speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question
of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We
investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we eliminate
information related to specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech,
and visual) in the language model representations, and observe how this
intervention affects the alignment with fMRI brain recordings acquired while
participants read versus listened to the same naturalistic stories. We further
contrast our findings with speech-based language models, which would be
expected to predict speech-evoked brain activity better, provided they model
language processing in the brain well. Using our direct approach, we find that
both text-based and speech-based language models align well with early sensory
regions due to shared low-level features. Text-based models continue to align
well with later language regions even after removing these features, while,
surprisingly, speech-based models lose most of their alignment. These findings
suggest that speech-based models can be further improved to better reflect
brain-like language processing.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of learning a graph modeling the statistical
relations of the $d$ variables of a dataset with $n$ samples $X \in
\mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. Standard approaches amount to searching for a
precision matrix $\Theta$ representative of a Gaussian graphical model that
adequately explains the data. However, most maximum likelihood-based estimators
usually require storing the $d^{2}$ values of the empirical covariance matrix,
which can become prohibitive in a high-dimensional setting. In this work, we
adopt a compressive viewpoint and aim to estimate a sparse $\Theta$ from a
sketch of the data, i.e. a low-dimensional vector of size $m \ll d^{2}$
carefully designed from $X$ using nonlinear random features. Under certain
assumptions on the spectrum of $\Theta$ (or its condition number), we show that
it is possible to estimate it from a sketch of size $m=\Omega((d+2k)\log(d))$
where $k$ is the maximal number of edges of the underlying graph. These
information-theoretic guarantees are inspired by compressed sensing theory and
involve restricted isometry properties and instance optimal decoders. We
investigate the possibility of achieving practical recovery with an iterative
algorithm based on the graphical lasso, viewed as a specific denoiser. We
compare our approach and graphical lasso on synthetic datasets, demonstrating
its favorable performance even when the dataset is compressed.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04686</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning (ML) models have grown to a scale where training them
on a single machine becomes impractical. As a result, there is a growing trend
to leverage federated learning (FL) techniques to train large ML models in a
distributed and collaborative manner. These models, however, when deployed on
new devices, might struggle to generalize well due to domain shifts. In this
context, federated domain adaptation (FDA) emerges as a powerful approach to
address this challenge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most existing FDA approaches typically focus on aligning the distributions
between source and target domains by minimizing their (e.g., MMD) distance.
Such strategies, however, inevitably introduce high communication overheads and
can be highly sensitive to network reliability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce RF-TCA, an enhancement to the standard Transfer
Component Analysis approach that significantly accelerates computation without
compromising theoretical and empirical performance. Leveraging the
computational advantage of RF-TCA, we further extend it to FDA setting with
FedRF-TCA. The proposed FedRF-TCA protocol boasts communication complexity that
is \emph{independent} of the sample size, while maintaining performance that is
either comparable to or even surpasses state-of-the-art FDA methods. We present
extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance and robustness (to
network condition) of FedRF-TCA.

<title>Challenging Common Assumptions in Multi-task Learning. (arXiv:2311.04698v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04698</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent
years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did
not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL)
baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about
challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we challenge common assumptions in
MTL in the context of STL: First, the choice of optimizer has only been mildly
investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such as the
Adam optimizer in MTL. We deduce the effectiveness of Adam to its partial
loss-scale invariance. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has often been
phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of gradient
conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment we find
no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize differences in
gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Lastly, we compare the
transferability of features learned through MTL and STL on common image
corruptions, and find no conclusive evidence that MTL leads to superior
transferability. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL
suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04711</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models are able to capture the
semantic relationship of images and texts and have enabled a wide range of
applications, from image retrieval to classification. These models are trained
with datasets extracted from web crawls, which are of large quantity but
limited quality. This paper explores whether limited amounts higher quality
data in a specific domain improve the general performance of CLIP models. To
this purpose, we extract text-image data from scientific papers hosted in the
arXiv and PubMed Central repositories. Experiments on small-scale CLIP models
(ViT B/32) show that model performance increases on average, but only
moderately. This result indicates that using the data sources considered in the
paper to train large-scale CLIP models is a worthwile research direction.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04731</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study the robust best-arm identification problem (RBAI) in the case of
linear rewards. The primary objective is to identify a near-optimal robust arm,
which involves selecting arms at every round and assessing their robustness by
exploring potential adversarial actions. This approach is particularly relevant
when utilizing a simulator and seeking to identify a robust solution for
real-world transfer. To this end, we present an instance-dependent lower bound
for the robust best-arm identification problem with linear rewards.
Furthermore, we propose both static and adaptive bandit algorithms that achieve
sample complexity that matches the lower bound. In synthetic experiments, our
algorithms effectively identify the best robust arm and perform similarly to
the oracle strategy. As an application, we examine diabetes care and the
process of learning insulin dose recommendations that are robust with respect
to inaccuracies in standard calculators. Our algorithms prove to be effective
in identifying robust dosage values across various age ranges of patients.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04740</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In multi-agent systems, agents possess only local observations of the
environment. Communication between teammates becomes crucial for enhancing
coordination. Past research has primarily focused on encoding local information
into embedding messages which are unintelligible to humans. We find that using
these messages in agent&apos;s policy learning leads to brittle policies when tested
on out-of-distribution initial states. We present an approach to multi-agent
coordination, where each agent is equipped with the capability to integrate its
(history of) observations, actions and messages received into a Common
Operating Picture (COP) and disseminate the COP. This process takes into
account the dynamic nature of the environment and the shared mission. We
conducted experiments in the StarCraft2 environment to validate our approach.
Our results demonstrate the efficacy of COP integration, and show that
COP-based training leads to robust policies compared to state-of-the-art
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods when faced with

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to address the data
sparsity problems that exist in traditional sequential recommendation (SR)
systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing approaches aim to design a specific cross-domain unit that can
transfer and propagate information across multiple domains by relying on
overlapping users with abundant behaviors. However, in real-world recommender
systems, CDSR scenarios usually consist of a majority of long-tailed users with
sparse behaviors and cold-start users who only exist in one domain. This leads
to a drop in the performance of existing CDSR methods in the real-world
industry platform. Therefore, improving the consistency and effectiveness of
models in open-world CDSR scenarios is crucial for constructing CDSR models
(\textit{1st} CH). Recently, some SR approaches have utilized auxiliary
behaviors to complement the information for long-tailed users. However, these
multi-behavior SR methods cannot deliver promising performance in CDSR, as they
overlook the semantic gap between target and auxiliary behaviors, as well as
user interest deviation across domains (\textit{2nd} CH).

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;During the operation of industrial robots, unusual events may endanger the
safety of humans and the quality of production. When collecting data to detect
such cases, it is not ensured that data from all potentially occurring errors
is included as unforeseeable events may happen over time. Therefore, anomaly
detection (AD) delivers a practical solution, using only normal data to learn
to detect unusual events. We introduce a dataset that allows training and
benchmarking of anomaly detection methods for robotic applications based on
machine data which will be made publicly available to the research community.
As a typical robot task the dataset includes a pick-and-place application which
involves movement, actions of the end effector and interactions with the
objects of the environment. Since several of the contained anomalies are not
task-specific but general, evaluations on our dataset are transferable to other
robotics applications as well. Additionally, we present MVT-Flow (multivariate
time-series flow) as a new baseline method for anomaly detection: It relies on
deep-learning-based density estimation with normalizing flows, tailored to the
data domain by taking its structure into account for the architecture. Our
evaluation shows that MVT-Flow outperforms baselines from previous work by a
large margin of 6.2% in area under ROC.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sepsis and septic shock are a critical medical condition affecting millions
globally, with a substantial mortality rate. This paper uses state-of-the-art
deep learning (DL) architectures to introduce a multi-step forecasting system
to predict vital signs indicative of septic shock progression in Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Our approach utilizes a short window of historical vital sign
data to forecast future physiological conditions. We introduce a DL-based vital
sign forecasting system that predicts up to 3 hours of future vital signs from
6 hours of past data. We further adopt the DILATE loss function to capture
better the shape and temporal dynamics of vital signs, which are critical for
clinical decision-making. We compare three DL models, N-BEATS, N-HiTS, and
Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), using the publicly available eICU
Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), highlighting their forecasting
capabilities in a critical care setting. We evaluate the performance of our
models using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics.
Our findings show that while TFT excels in capturing overall trends, N-HiTS is
superior in retaining short-term fluctuations within a predefined range. This
paper demonstrates the potential of deep learning in transforming the
monitoring systems in ICUs, potentially leading to significant improvements in
patient care and outcomes by accurately forecasting vital signs to assist
healthcare providers in detecting early signs of physiological instability and
anticipating septic shock.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In recent years, computer vision has transformed fields such as medical
imaging, object recognition, and geospatial analytics. One of the fundamental
tasks in computer vision is semantic image segmentation, which is vital for
precise object delineation. Autonomous driving represents one of the key areas
where computer vision algorithms are applied. The task of road surface
segmentation is crucial in self-driving systems, but it requires a
labor-intensive annotation process in several data domains. The work described
in this paper aims to improve the efficiency of image segmentation using a
convolutional neural network in a multi-sensor setup. This approach leverages
lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) annotations to directly train image
segmentation models on RGB images. Lidar supplements the images by emitting
laser pulses and measuring reflections to provide depth information. However,
lidar&apos;s sparse point clouds often create difficulties for accurate object
segmentation. Segmentation of point clouds requires time-consuming preliminary
data preparation and a large amount of computational resources. The key
innovation of our approach is the masked loss, addressing sparse ground-truth
masks from point clouds. By calculating loss exclusively where lidar points
exist, the model learns road segmentation on images by using lidar points as
ground truth. This approach allows for blending of different ground-truth data
types during model training. Experimental validation of the approach on
benchmark datasets shows comparable performance to a high-quality image
segmentation model. Incorporating lidar reduces the load on annotations and
enables training of image-segmentation models without loss of segmentation
quality. The methodology is tested on diverse datasets, both publicly available
and proprietary. The strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method are also
discussed in the paper.

FetMRQC, an open-source machine-learning framework for automated image quality
assessment and quality control that is robust to domain shifts induced by the
heterogeneity of clinical data. FetMRQC extracts an ensemble of quality metrics
from unprocessed anatomical MRI and combines them to predict experts&apos; ratings
using random forests. We validate our framework on a pioneeringly large and
diverse dataset of more than 1600 manually rated fetal brain T2-weighted images
from four clinical centers and 13 different scanners. Our study shows that

FetMRQC is a step towards more robust fetal brain neuroimaging, which has the

<title>Why Do Clinical Probabilistic Models Fail To Transport Between Sites?. (arXiv:2311.04787v1 [cs.LG])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of artificial intelligence in healthcare is
highlighting the problem that a computational model achieving super-human
clinical performance at its training sites may perform substantially worse at
new sites. In this perspective, we present common sources for this failure to
transport, which we divide into sources under the control of the experimenter
and sources inherent to the clinical data-generating process. Of the inherent
sources we look a little deeper into site-specific clinical practices that can
affect the data distribution, and propose a potential solution intended to
isolate the imprint of those practices on the data from the patterns of disease
cause and effect that are the usual target of clinical models.

<title>Determination of toxic comments and unintended model bias minimization using Deep learning approach. (arXiv:2311.04789v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04789</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Online conversations can be toxic and subjected to threats, abuse, or
harassment. To identify toxic text comments, several deep learning and machine
learning models have been proposed throughout the years. However, recent
studies demonstrate that because of the imbalances in the training data, some
models are more likely to show unintended biases including gender bias and
identity bias. In this research, our aim is to detect toxic comment and reduce
the unintended bias concerning identity features such as race, gender, sex,
religion by fine-tuning an attention based model called BERT(Bidirectional
Encoder Representation from Transformers). We apply weighted loss to address
the issue of unbalanced data and compare the performance of a fine-tuned BERT
model with a traditional Logistic Regression model in terms of classification
and bias minimization. The Logistic Regression model with the TFIDF vectorizer
achieve 57.1% accuracy, and fine-tuned BERT model&apos;s accuracy is 89%. Code is

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Identifying root causes for unexpected or undesirable behavior in complex
systems is a prevalent challenge. This issue becomes especially crucial in
modern cloud applications that employ numerous microservices. Although the
machine learning and systems research communities have proposed various
techniques to tackle this problem, there is currently a lack of standardized
datasets for quantitative benchmarking. Consequently, research groups are
compelled to create their own datasets for experimentation. This paper
introduces a dataset specifically designed for evaluating root cause analyses
in microservice-based applications. The dataset encompasses latency, requests,
and availability metrics emitted in 5-minute intervals from a distributed
application. In addition to normal operation metrics, the dataset includes 68
injected performance issues, which increase latency and reduce availability
throughout the system. We showcase how this dataset can be used to evaluate the
accuracy of a variety of methods spanning different causal and non-causal
characterisations of the root cause analysis problem. We hope the new dataset,
available at https://github.com/amazon-science/petshop-root-cause-analysis/
enables further development of techniques in this important area.

<title>A Lightweight Architecture for Real-Time Neuronal-Spike Classification. (arXiv:2311.04808v1 [cs.AR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04808</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological recordings of neural activity in a mouse&apos;s brain are
very popular among neuroscientists for understanding brain function. One
particular area of interest is acquiring recordings from the Purkinje cells in
the cerebellum in order to understand brain injuries and the loss of motor
functions. However, current setups for such experiments do not allow the mouse
to move freely and, thus, do not capture its natural behaviour since they have
a wired connection between the animal&apos;s head stage and an acquisition device.
In this work, we propose a lightweight neuronal-spike detection and
classification architecture that leverages on the unique characteristics of the
Purkinje cells to discard unneeded information from the sparse neural data in
real time. This allows the (condensed) data to be easily stored on a removable
storage device on the head stage, alleviating the need for wires. Our proposed
implementation shows a &amp;gt;95% overall classification accuracy while still
resulting in a small-form-factor design, which allows for the free movement of
mice during experiments. Moreover, the power-efficient nature of the design and
the usage of STT-RAM (Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory) as
the removable storage allows the head stage to easily operate on a tiny battery
for up to approximately 4 days.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04817</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Vanilla federated learning does not support learning in an online
environment, learning a personalized model on each client, and learning in a
decentralized setting. There are existing methods extending federated learning
in each of the three aspects. However, some important applications on
enterprise edge servers (e.g. online item recommendation at global scale)
involve the three aspects at the same time. Therefore, we propose a new
learning setting \textit{Decentralized Personalized Online Federated Learning}
that considers all the three aspects at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new setting for learning, the first technical challenge is how to
aggregate the shared model parameters from neighboring clients to obtain a
personalized local model with good performance on each client. We propose to
directly learn an aggregation by optimizing the performance of the local model
with respect to the aggregation weights. This not only improves personalization
of each local model but also helps the local model adapting to potential data
shift by intelligently incorporating the right amount of information from its
neighbors. The second challenge is how to select the neighbors for each client.
We propose a peer selection method based on the learned aggregation weights
enabling each client to select the most helpful neighbors and reduce
communication cost at the same time. We verify the effectiveness and robustness
of our proposed method on three real-world item recommendation datasets and one
air quality prediction dataset.

<title>Cross-Silo Federated Learning Across Divergent Domains with Iterative Parameter Alignment. (arXiv:2311.04818v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04818</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning from the collective knowledge of data dispersed across private
sources can provide neural networks with enhanced generalization capabilities.
Federated learning, a method for collaboratively training a machine learning
model across remote clients, achieves this by combining client models via the
orchestration of a central server. However, current approaches face two
critical limitations: i) they struggle to converge when client domains are
sufficiently different, and ii) current aggregation techniques produce an
identical global model for each client. In this work, we address these issues
by reformulating the typical federated learning setup: rather than learning a
single global model, we learn N models each optimized for a common objective.
To achieve this, we apply a weighted distance minimization to model parameters
shared in a peer-to-peer topology. The resulting framework, Iterative Parameter
Alignment, applies naturally to the cross-silo setting, and has the following
properties: (i) a unique solution for each participant, with the option to
globally converge each model in the federation, and (ii) an optional
early-stopping mechanism to elicit fairness among peers in collaborative
learning settings. These characteristics jointly provide a flexible new
framework for iteratively learning from peer models trained on disparate
datasets. We find that the technique achieves competitive results on a variety
of data partitions compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, we show
that the method is robust to divergent domains (i.e. disjoint classes across
peers) where existing approaches struggle.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04823</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior
abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,
there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence
modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the
linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates
within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model
dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes
forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound
increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to
model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,
short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image
classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and
effectiveness of our proposed model. The source code is available at

<title>Functional Bayesian Tucker Decomposition for Continuous-indexed Tensor Data. (arXiv:2311.04829v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04829</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Tucker decomposition is a powerful tensor model to handle multi-aspect data.
It demonstrates the low-rank property by decomposing the grid-structured data
as interactions between a core tensor and a set of object representations
(factors). A fundamental assumption of such decomposition is that there were
finite objects in each aspect or mode, corresponding to discrete indexes of
data entries. However, many real-world data are not naturally posed in the
setting. For example, geographic data is represented as continuous indexes of
latitude and longitude coordinates, and cannot fit tensor models directly. To
generalize Tucker decomposition to such scenarios, we propose Functional
Bayesian Tucker Decomposition (FunBaT). We treat the continuous-indexed data as
the interaction between the Tucker core and a group of latent functions. We use
Gaussian processes (GP) as functional priors to model the latent functions, and
then convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent
stochastic differential equation (SDE) to reduce computational cost. An
efficient inference algorithm is further developed for scalable posterior
approximation based on advanced message-passing techniques. The advantage of
our method is shown in both synthetic data and several real-world applications.

By combining it with TD($\lambda$), a variant of temporaldifference
reinforcement learning with eligibility traces, we create a biologically
plausible, recurrent actor-critic algorithm, capable of solving discrete and
continuous control tasks in POMDPs. We compare BPTT, RTRL and RFLO as well as
different network architectures, and find that RFLO can perform just as well as
RTRL while exceeding even BPTT in terms of complexity. The proposed method,

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Although graph neural networks have achieved great success in the task of
molecular property prediction in recent years, their generalization ability
under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings is still under-explored. Different
from existing methods that learn discriminative representations for prediction,
we propose a generative model with semantic-components identifiability, named
SCI. We demonstrate that the latent variables in this generative model can be
explicitly identified into semantic-relevant (SR) and semantic-irrelevant (SI)
components, which contributes to better OOD generalization by involving minimal
change properties of causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first formulate the
data generation process from the atom level to the molecular level, where the
latent space is split into SI substructures, SR substructures, and SR atom
variables. Sequentially, to reduce misidentification, we restrict the minimal
changes of the SR atom variables and add a semantic latent substructure
regularization to mitigate the variance of the SR substructure under augmented
domain changes. Under mild assumptions, we prove the block-wise identifiability
of the SR substructure and the comment-wise identifiability of SR atom
variables. Experimental studies achieve state-of-the-art performance and show
general improvement on 21 datasets in 3 mainstream benchmarks. Moreover, the
visualization results of the proposed SCI method provide insightful case
studies and explanations for the prediction results. The code is available at:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The evolution towards a more distributed and interconnected grid necessitates
large-scale decision-making within strict temporal constraints. Machine
learning (ML) paradigms have demonstrated significant potential in improving
the efficacy of optimization processes. However, the feasibility of solutions
derived from ML models continues to pose challenges. It&apos;s imperative that ML
models produce solutions that are attainable and realistic within the given
system constraints of power systems. To address the feasibility issue and
expedite the solution search process, we proposed LOOP-LC 2.0(Learning to
Optimize the Optimization Process with Linear Constraints version 2.0) as a
learning-based approach for solving the power dispatch problem. A notable
advantage of the LOOP-LC 2.0 framework is its ability to ensure near-optimality
and strict feasibility of solutions without depending on computationally
intensive post-processing procedures, thus eliminating the need for iterative
processes. At the heart of the LOOP-LC 2.0 model lies the newly proposed
generalized gauge map method, capable of mapping any infeasible solution to a
feasible point within the linearly-constrained domain. The proposed generalized
gauge map method improves the traditional gauge map by exhibiting reduced
sensitivity to input variances while increasing search speeds significantly.
Utilizing the IEEE-200 test case as a benchmark, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the LOOP-LC 2.0 methodology, confirming its superior
performance in terms of training speed, computational time, optimality, and
solution feasibility compared to existing methodologies.

<title>Bridging Dimensions: Confident Reachability for High-Dimensional Controllers. (arXiv:2311.04843v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04843</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Autonomous systems are increasingly implemented using end-end-end trained
controllers. Such controllers make decisions that are executed on the real
system with images as one of the primary sensing modalities. Deep neural
networks form a fundamental building block of such controllers. Unfortunately,
the existing neural-network verification tools do not scale to inputs with
thousands of dimensions. Especially when the individual inputs (such as pixels)
are devoid of clear physical meaning. This paper takes a step towards
connecting exhaustive closed-loop verification with high-dimensional
controllers. Our key insight is that the behavior of a high-dimensional
controller can be approximated with several low-dimensional controllers in
different regions of the state space. To balance approximation and
verifiability, we leverage the latest verification-aware knowledge
distillation. Then, if low-dimensional reachability results are inflated with
statistical approximation errors, they yield a high-confidence reachability
guarantee for the high-dimensional controller. We investigate two inflation
techniques -- based on trajectories and actions -- both of which show
convincing performance in two OpenAI gym benchmarks.

<title>Incorporating temporal dynamics of mutations to enhance the prediction capability of antiretroviral therapy&apos;s outcome for HIV-1. (arXiv:2311.04846v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04846</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Motivation: In predicting HIV therapy outcomes, a critical clinical question
is whether using historical information can enhance predictive capabilities
compared with current or latest available data analysis. This study analyses
whether historical knowledge, which includes viral mutations detected in all
genotypic tests before therapy, their temporal occurrence, and concomitant
viral load measurements, can bring improvements. We introduce a method to weigh
mutations, considering the previously enumerated factors and the reference
mutation-drug Stanford resistance tables. We compare a model encompassing
history (H) with one not using it (NH). Results: The H-model demonstrates
superior discriminative ability, with a higher ROC-AUC score (76.34%) than the
NH-model (74.98%). Significant Wilcoxon test results confirm that incorporating
historical information improves consistently predictive accuracy for treatment
outcomes. The better performance of the H-model might be attributed to its
consideration of latent HIV reservoirs, probably obtained when leveraging
historical information. The findings emphasize the importance of temporal
dynamics in mutations, offering insights into HIV infection complexities.
However, our result also shows that prediction accuracy remains relatively high
even when no historical information is available. Supplementary information:

<title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values. (arXiv:2311.04855v1 [astro-ph.IM])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction
technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially
astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative
values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly
positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically
consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with
many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and
Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any
introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space
without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any
introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We
demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and
prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce Residue Hyperdimensional Computing, a computing framework that
unifies residue number systems with an algebra defined over random,
high-dimensional vectors. We show how residue numbers can be represented as
high-dimensional vectors in a manner that allows algebraic operations to be
performed with component-wise, parallelizable operations on the vector
elements. The resulting framework, when combined with an efficient method for
factorizing high-dimensional vectors, can represent and operate on numerical
values over a large dynamic range using vastly fewer resources than previous
methods, and it exhibits impressive robustness to noise. We demonstrate the
potential for this framework to solve computationally difficult problems in
visual perception and combinatorial optimization, showing improvement over
baseline methods. More broadly, the framework provides a possible account for
the computational operations of grid cells in the brain, and it suggests new
machine learning architectures for representing and manipulating numerical
data.

<title>SEMQA: Semi-Extractive Multi-Source Question Answering. (arXiv:2311.04886v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04886</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently proposed long-form question answering (QA) systems, supported by
large language models (LLMs), have shown promising capabilities. Yet,
attributing and verifying their generated abstractive answers can be difficult,
and automatically evaluating their accuracy remains an ongoing challenge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduce a new QA task for answering multi-answer questions
by summarizing multiple diverse sources in a semi-extractive fashion.
Specifically, Semi-extractive Multi-source QA (SEMQA) requires models to output
a comprehensive answer, while mixing factual quoted spans -- copied verbatim
from given input sources -- and non-factual free-text connectors that glue
these spans together into a single cohesive passage. This setting bridges the
gap between the outputs of well-grounded but constrained extractive QA systems
and more fluent but harder to attribute fully abstractive answers.
Particularly, it enables a new mode for language models that leverages their
advanced language generation capabilities, while also producing fine in-line
attributions by-design that are easy to verify, interpret, and evaluate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study this task, we create the first dataset of this kind, QuoteSum, with
human-written semi-extractive answers to natural and generated questions, and
define text-based evaluation metrics. Experimenting with several LLMs in
various settings, we find this task to be surprisingly challenging,
demonstrating the importance of QuoteSum for developing and studying such
consolidation capabilities.

for the tasks of Image Classification and Object Detection in Computer Vision.
In a first contribution, we are interested in bridging the gap between theory
and practice for popular Meta-Learning algorithms used in Few-Shot
Classification. We make connections to Multi-Task Representation Learning,
which benefits from solid theoretical foundations, to verify the best
conditions for a more efficient meta-learning. Then, to leverage unlabeled data
when training object detectors based on the Transformer architecture, we
propose both an unsupervised pretraining and a semi-supervised learning method
in two other separate contributions. For pretraining, we improve Contrastive
Learning for object detectors by introducing the localization information.
Finally, our semi-supervised method is the first tailored to transformer-based
detectors.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04894</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Construction of a universal detector poses a crucial question: How can we
most effectively train a model on a large mixture of datasets? The answer lies
in learning dataset-specific features and ensembling their knowledge but do all
this in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate
detection heads on a common backbone but that results in a significant increase
in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution,
highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose
Dataset-Aware Mixture-of-Experts, DAMEX where we train the experts to become an
`expert&apos; of a dataset by learning to route each dataset tokens to its mapped
expert. Experiments on Universal Object-Detection Benchmark show that we
outperform the existing state-of-the-art by average +10.2 AP score and improve
over our non-MoE baseline by average +2.0 AP score. We also observe consistent
gains while mixing datasets with (1) limited availability, (2) disparate
domains and (3) divergent label sets. Further, we qualitatively show that DAMEX
is robust against expert representation collapse.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deterministic chaos permits a precise notion of a &quot;perfect measurement&quot; as
one that, when obtained repeatedly, captures all of the information created by
the system&apos;s evolution with minimal redundancy. Finding an optimal measurement

in the few cases where it has been done. We establish an equivalence between a
perfect measurement and a variant of the information bottleneck. As a
consequence, we can employ machine learning to optimize measurement processes
that efficiently extract information from trajectory data. We obtain
approximately optimal measurements for multiple chaotic maps and lay the
necessary groundwork for efficient information extraction from general time
series.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We conjecture that hidden state vectors corresponding to individual input
tokens encode information sufficient to accurately predict several tokens
ahead. More concretely, in this paper we ask: Given a hidden (internal)
representation of a single token at position $t$ in an input, can we reliably
anticipate the tokens that will appear at positions $\geq t + 2$? To test this,
we measure linear approximation and causal intervention methods in GPT-J-6B to
evaluate the degree to which individual hidden states in the network contain
signal rich enough to predict future hidden states and, ultimately, token
outputs. We find that, at some layers, we can approximate a model&apos;s output with
more than 48% accuracy with respect to its prediction of subsequent tokens
through a single hidden state. Finally we present a &quot;Future Lens&quot; visualization
that uses these methods to create a new view of transformer states.

<title>Two Complementary Perspectives to Continual Learning: Ask Not Only What to Optimize, But Also How. (arXiv:2311.04898v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04898</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen considerable progress in the continual training of
deep neural networks, predominantly thanks to approaches that add replay or
regularization terms to the loss function to approximate the joint loss over
all tasks so far. However, we show that even with a perfect approximation to
the joint loss, these approaches still suffer from temporary but substantial
forgetting when starting to train on a new task. Motivated by this &apos;stability
gap&apos;, we propose that continual learning strategies should focus not only on
the optimization objective, but also on the way this objective is optimized.
While there is some continual learning work that alters the optimization
trajectory (e.g., using gradient projection techniques), this line of research
is positioned as alternative to improving the optimization objective, while we
argue it should be complementary. To evaluate the merits of our proposition, we
plan to combine replay-approximated joint objectives with gradient
projection-based optimization routines to test whether the addition of the
latter provides benefits in terms of (1) alleviating the stability gap, (2)
increasing the learning efficiency and (3) improving the final learning
outcome.

<title>Beyond Size: How Gradients Shape Pruning Decisions in Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.04902v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04902</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) with a billion or more parameters are prime
targets for network pruning, which aims to reduce a portion of the network
weights without compromising performance. Prior approaches such as Weights
Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda, either concentrated solely on weights or
integrated weights with activations for sparsity. However, they overlooked the
informative gradients derived from pretrained large language models. In this
paper, we present a novel sparsity-centric pruning method for pretrained LLMs,
termed Gradient-based Language Model Pruner (GBLM-Pruner). GBLM-Pruner
leverages the first-order term of the Taylor expansion, operating in a
training-free manner by harnessing properly normalized gradients from a few
calibration samples to determine the importance pruning score, and
substantially outperforms competitive counterparts like SparseGPT and Wanda in
multiple benchmarks. Intriguing, after incorporating gradients, the
unstructured pruning method tends to reveal some structural patterns
post-pruning, which mirrors the geometric interdependence inherent in the LLMs&apos;
parameter structure. Additionally, GBLM-Pruner functions without any subsequent
retraining or weight updates to maintain its simplicity as other counterparts.
Extensive evaluations on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks
and perplexity show that GBLM-Pruner surpasses magnitude pruning, Wanda
(weights+activations) and SparseGPT (weights+activations+weight update) by
significant margins. Our code and models are available at

very strong theoretical guarantee that a model from which data is removed

empirically study learning settings in which this mechanism is practical.

<title>RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding. (arXiv:2104.09864v5 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer
architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between
elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first
investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the
learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel
method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the
positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute
position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit
relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE
enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length,
decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the
capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position
encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position
embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark
datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental
results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Building efficient, accurate and generalizable reduced order models of
developed turbulence remains a major challenge. This manuscript approaches this
problem by developing a hierarchy of parameterized reduced Lagrangian models
for turbulent flows, and investigates the effects of enforcing physical
structure through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) versus relying on
neural networks (NN)s as universal function approximators. Starting from Neural
Network (NN) parameterizations of a Lagrangian acceleration operator, this
hierarchy of models gradually incorporates a weakly compressible and
parameterized SPH framework, which enforces physical symmetries, such as
Galilean, rotational and translational invariances. Within this hierarchy, two
new parameterized smoothing kernels are developed in order to increase the
flexibility of the learn-able SPH simulators. For each model we experiment with
different loss functions which are minimized using gradient based optimization,
where efficient computations of gradients are obtained by using Automatic
Differentiation (AD) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA). Each model within the
hierarchy is trained on two data sets associated with weekly compressible
Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT): (1) a validation set using weakly
compressible SPH; and (2) a high fidelity set from Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS). Numerical evidence shows that encoding more SPH structure improves
generalizability to different turbulent Mach numbers and time shifts, and that
including the novel parameterized smoothing kernels improves the accuracy of
SPH at the resolved scales.

<title>Causal Scoring: A Framework for Effect Estimation, Effect Ordering, and Effect Classification. (arXiv:2206.12532v3 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12532</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces causal scoring as a novel approach to frame causal
estimation in the context of decision making. Causal scoring entails the
estimation of scores that support decision making by providing insights into
causal effects. We present three valuable causal interpretations of these
scores: effect estimation (EE), effect ordering (EO), and effect classification
(EC). In the EE interpretation, the causal score represents the effect itself.
The EO interpretation implies that the score can serve as a proxy for the
magnitude of the effect, enabling the sorting of individuals based on their
causal effects. The EC interpretation enables the classification of individuals
into high- and low-effect categories using a predefined threshold. We
demonstrate the value of these alternative causal interpretations (EO and EC)
through two key results. First, we show that aligning the statistical modeling
with the desired causal interpretation improves the accuracy of causal
estimation. Second, we establish that more flexible causal interpretations are
plausible in a wider range of data-generating processes and propose conditions
to assess their validity. We showcase the practical utility of the causal
scoring framework through examples in diverse fields such as advertising,
healthcare, and education, illustrating how it facilitates reasoning about
flexible causal interpretations of statistical estimates in various contexts.
The examples encompass confounded estimates, effect estimates on surrogate
outcomes, and even predictions about non-causal quantities as potential causal
scores.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Abstract semantic 3D scene understanding is a problem of critical importance
in robotics. As robots still lack the common-sense knowledge about household
objects and locations of an average human, we investigate the use of
pre-trained language models to impart common sense for scene understanding. We
introduce and compare a wide range of scene classification paradigms that
leverage language only (zero-shot, embedding-based, and structured-language) or
vision and language (zero-shot and fine-tuned). We find that the best
approaches in both categories yield $\sim 70\%$ room classification accuracy,
exceeding the performance of pure-vision and graph classifiers. We also find
such methods demonstrate notable generalization and transfer capabilities
stemming from their use of language.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We tackle the challenge of robotic bin packing with irregular objects, such
as groceries. Given the diverse physical attributes of these objects and the
complex constraints governing their placement and manipulation, employing
preprogrammed strategies becomes unfeasible. Our approach is to learn directly
from expert demonstrations in order to extract implicit task knowledge and
strategies to ensure safe object positioning, efficient use of space, and the
generation of human-like behaviors that enhance human-robot trust.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely on human demonstrations to learn a Markov chain for predicting the
object packing sequence for a given set of items and then compare it with human
performance. Our experimental results show that the model outperforms human
performance by generating sequence predictions that humans classify as
human-like more frequently than human-generated sequences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human demonstrations were collected using our proposed VR platform,
BoxED, which is a box packaging environment for simulating real-world objects
and scenarios for fast and streamlined data collection with the purpose of
teaching robots. We collected data from 43 participants packing a total of 263
boxes with supermarket-like objects, yielding 4644 object manipulations. Our VR

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in Transformer architectures have empowered their empirical
success in a variety of tasks across different domains. However, existing works
mainly focus on predictive accuracy and computational cost, without considering
other practical issues, such as robustness to contaminated samples. Recent work
by Nguyen et al., (2022) has shown that the self-attention mechanism, which is
the center of the Transformer architecture, can be viewed as a non-parametric
estimator based on kernel density estimation (KDE). This motivates us to
leverage a set of robust kernel density estimation methods for alleviating the
issue of data contamination. Specifically, we introduce a series of
self-attention mechanisms that can be incorporated into different Transformer
architectures and discuss the special properties of each method. We then
perform extensive empirical studies on language modeling and image
classification tasks. Our methods demonstrate robust performance in multiple
scenarios while maintaining competitive results on clean datasets.

significantly reduces gradient variance, leading to faster optimization in
several applications.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08349</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Designing and analyzing model-based RL (MBRL) algorithms with guaranteed
monotonic improvement has been challenging, mainly due to the interdependence
between policy optimization and model learning. Existing discrepancy bounds
generally ignore the impacts of model shifts, and their corresponding
algorithms are prone to degrade performance by drastic model updating. In this
work, we first propose a novel and general theoretical scheme for a
non-decreasing performance guarantee of MBRL. Our follow-up derived bounds
reveal the relationship between model shifts and performance improvement. These
discoveries encourage us to formulate a constrained lower-bound optimization
problem to permit the monotonicity of MBRL. A further example demonstrates that
learning models from a dynamically-varying number of explorations benefit the
eventual returns. Motivated by these analyses, we design a simple but effective
algorithm CMLO (Constrained Model-shift Lower-bound Optimization), by
introducing an event-triggered mechanism that flexibly determines when to
update the model. Experiments show that CMLO surpasses other state-of-the-art
methods and produces a boost when various policy optimization methods are
employed.

<title>Implicit models, latent compression, intrinsic biases, and cheap lunches in community detection. (arXiv:2210.09186v7 [cs.SI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09186</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The task of community detection, which aims to partition a network into
clusters of nodes to summarize its large-scale structure, has spawned the
development of many competing algorithms with varying objectives. Some
community detection methods are inferential, explicitly deriving the clustering
objective through a probabilistic generative model, while other methods are
descriptive, dividing a network according to an objective motivated by a
particular application, making it challenging to compare these methods on the
same scale. Here we present a solution to this problem that associates any
community detection objective, inferential or descriptive, with its
corresponding implicit network generative model. This allows us to compute the
description length of a network and its partition under arbitrary objectives,
providing a principled measure to compare the performance of different
algorithms without the need for &quot;ground truth&quot; labels. Our approach also gives
access to instances of the community detection problem that are optimal to any
given algorithm, and in this way reveals intrinsic biases in popular
descriptive methods, explaining their tendency to overfit. Using our framework,
we compare a number of community detection methods on artificial networks, and
on a corpus of over 500 structurally diverse empirical networks. We find that
more expressive community detection methods exhibit consistently superior
compression performance on structured data instances, without having degraded
performance on a minority of situations where more specialized algorithms
perform optimally. Our results undermine the implications of the &quot;no free
lunch&quot; theorem for community detection, both conceptually and in practice,
since it is confined to unstructured data instances, unlike relevant community
detection problems which are structured by requirement.

<title>Neuro-Symbolic Causal Reasoning Meets Signaling Game for Emergent Semantic Communications. (arXiv:2210.12040v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12040</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Semantic communication (SC) aims to communicate reliably with minimal data
transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity to heterogeneous
services and users. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework
is proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design
and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal
reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using
an alternating maximization between the communicating node&apos;s utilities. The
emergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal
semantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling
generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler
reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is
then modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant
attributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the
receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its
task. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently
proposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for
higher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel
metrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that
are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby
generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon&apos;s notion of uncertainty. Simulation
results validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced
bits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and
state-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.

where $N_m$ is the number of items in the dataset. To address this problem, we
propose a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) scheme to combine
with FM and apply quantum annealing (QA) computation. Compared to classical
methods, this hybrid algorithm provides a faster than quadratic speedup in
finding good user suggestions. We then demonstrate the aforementioned
computational advantage on current NISQ hardware by experimenting with a real

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We investigate the spectral properties of linear-width feed-forward neural
networks, where the sample size is asymptotically proportional to network
width. Empirically, we show that the spectra of weight in this high dimensional
regime are invariant when trained by gradient descent for small constant
learning rates; we provide a theoretical justification for this observation and
prove the invariance of the bulk spectra for both conjugate and neural tangent
kernels. We demonstrate similar characteristics when training with stochastic
gradient descent with small learning rates. When the learning rate is large, we
exhibit the emergence of an outlier whose corresponding eigenvector is aligned
with the training data structure. We also show that after adaptive gradient
training, where a lower test error and feature learning emerge, both weight and
kernel matrices exhibit heavy tail behavior. Simple examples are provided to
explain when heavy tails can have better generalizations. We exhibit different
spectral properties such as invariant bulk, spike, and heavy-tailed
distribution from a two-layer neural network using different training
strategies, and then correlate them to the feature learning. Analogous
phenomena also appear when we train conventional neural networks with
real-world data. We conclude that monitoring the evolution of the spectra

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In machine learning or scientific computing, model performance is measured
with an objective function. But why choose one objective over another?
Information theory gives one answer: To maximize the information in the model,
select the objective function that represents the error in the fewest bits. To
evaluate different objectives, transform them into likelihood functions. As
likelihoods, their relative magnitude represents how strongly we should prefer
one objective versus another, and the log of that relation represents the
difference in their bit-length, as well as the difference in their uncertainty.
In other words, prefer whichever objective minimizes the uncertainty. Under the
information-theoretic paradigm, the ultimate objective is to maximize
information (and minimize uncertainty), as opposed to any specific utility. We
argue that this paradigm is well-suited to models that have many uses and no
definite utility, like the large Earth system models used to understand the
effects of climate change.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01734</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently, the impressive empirical success of policy gradient (PG) methods
has catalyzed the development of their theoretical foundations. Despite the
huge efforts directed at the design of efficient stochastic PG-type algorithms,
the understanding of their convergence to a globally optimal policy is still
limited. In this work, we develop improved global convergence guarantees for a
general class of Fisher-non-degenerate parameterized policies which allows to
address the case of continuous state action spaces. First, we propose a
Normalized Policy Gradient method with Implicit Gradient Transport (N-PG-IGT)
and derive a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of
this method for finding a global $\varepsilon$-optimal policy. Improving over
the previously known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity, this
algorithm does not require the use of importance sampling or second-order
information and samples only one trajectory per iteration. Second, we further
improve this complexity to $\tilde{ \mathcal{\mathcal{O}} }(\varepsilon^{-2})$
by considering a Hessian-Aided Recursive Policy Gradient ((N)-HARPG) algorithm
enhanced with a correction based on a Hessian-vector product. Interestingly,
both algorithms are $(i)$ simple and easy to implement: single-loop, do not
require large batches of trajectories and sample at most two trajectories per
iteration; $(ii)$ computationally and memory efficient: they do not require
expensive subroutines at each iteration and can be implemented with memory
linear in the dimension of parameters.

<title>Sharp Spectral Rates for Koopman Operator Learning. (arXiv:2302.02004v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02004</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated
Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward
in time. Learning the Koopman operator and its spectral decomposition from data
is enabled by a number of algorithms. In this work we present for the first
time non-asymptotic learning bounds for the Koopman eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions. We focus on time-reversal-invariant stochastic dynamical
systems, including the important example of Langevin dynamics. We analyze two
popular estimators: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and Reduced Rank
Regression (RRR). Our results critically hinge on novel {minimax} estimation
bounds for the operator norm error, that may be of independent interest. Our
spectral learning bounds are driven by the simultaneous control of the operator
norm error and a novel metric distortion functional of the estimated
eigenfunctions. The bounds indicates that both EDMD and RRR have similar
variance, but EDMD suffers from a larger bias which might be detrimental to its
learning rate. Our results shed new light on the emergence of spurious
eigenvalues, an issue which is well known empirically. Numerical experiments
illustrate the implications of the bounds in practice.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is a technique to generate complex and
diverse environments in an automated way. However, while generating content
with PCG methods is often straightforward, generating meaningful content that
reflects specific intentions and constraints remains challenging. Furthermore,
many PCG algorithms lack the ability to generate content in an open-ended
manner. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be incredibly
effective in many diverse domains. These trained LLMs can be fine-tuned,
re-using information and accelerating training for new tasks. Here, we
introduce MarioGPT, a fine-tuned GPT2 model trained to generate tile-based game
levels, in our case Super Mario Bros levels. MarioGPT can not only generate
diverse levels, but can be text-prompted for controllable level generation,
addressing one of the key challenges of current PCG techniques. As far as we
know, MarioGPT is the first text-to-level model and combined with novelty
search it enables the generation of diverse levels with varying play-style
dynamics (i.e. player paths) and the open-ended discovery of an increasingly
diverse range of content. Code available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07025</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised change detection between airborne LiDAR data points, taken at
separate times over the same location, can be difficult due to unmatching
spatial support and noise from the acquisition system. Most current approaches
to detect changes in point clouds rely heavily on the computation of Digital
Elevation Models (DEM) images and supervised methods. Obtaining a DEM leads to
LiDAR informational loss due to pixelisation, and supervision requires large
amounts of labelled data often unavailable in real-world scenarios. We propose
an unsupervised approach based on the computation of the transport of 3D LiDAR
points over two temporal supports. The method is based on unbalanced optimal
transport and can be generalised to any change detection problem with LiDAR
data. We apply our approach to publicly available datasets for monitoring urban
sprawling in various noise and resolution configurations that mimic several
sensors used in practice. Our method allows for unsupervised multi-class
classification and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
approaches by a significant margin.

<title>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection via Batch Normalization. (arXiv:2302.07849v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07849</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Anomaly detection (AD) plays a crucial role in many safety-critical
application domains. The challenge of adapting an anomaly detector to drift in
the normal data distribution, especially when no training data is available for
the &quot;new normal,&quot; has led to the development of zero-shot AD techniques. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Centered
Representations (ACR) for zero-shot batch-level AD. Our approach trains
off-the-shelf deep anomaly detectors (such as deep SVDD) to adapt to a set of
inter-related training data distributions in combination with batch
normalization, enabling automatic zero-shot generalization for unseen AD tasks.
This simple recipe, batch normalization plus meta-training, is a highly
effective and versatile tool. Our theoretical results guarantee the zero-shot
generalization for unseen AD tasks; our empirical results demonstrate the first
zero-shot AD results for tabular data and outperform existing methods in
zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation on image data from specialized
domains. Code is at https://github.com/aodongli/zero-shot-ad-via-batch-norm

<title>Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits. (arXiv:2302.07867v4 [cs.SE] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07867</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the waning of Moore&apos;s law, optimizing program performance has become a
major focus of software research. However, high-level optimizations such as API
and algorithm changes remain elusive due to the difficulty of understanding the
semantics of code. Simultaneously, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities at solving a wide range of programming tasks.
To that end, we introduce a framework for adapting LLMs to high-level program
optimization. First, we curate a dataset of performance-improving edits made by
human programmers of over 77K competitive C++ programming submission pairs,
accompanied by extensive unit tests. A major challenge is the significant
variability of measuring performance on commodity hardware, which can lead to
spurious &quot;improvements&quot;. To isolate and reliably evaluate the impact of program
optimizations, we design an environment based on the gem5 full system
simulator, the de facto simulator used in academia and industry. Next, we
propose a broad range of adaptation strategies for code optimization; for
prompting, these include retrieval-based few-shot prompting and
chain-of-thought, and for finetuning, these include performance-conditioned
generation and synthetic data augmentation based on self-play. A combination of
these techniques achieves an average speedup of 5.65X on CodeLlama-13B and
6.86X on GPT-3.5, surpassing the best human performance (4.06X). We find our
proposed performance-conditioned generation is particularly effective at
improving performance as well as increasing the fraction of optimized programs.

<title>Robust Mean Estimation Without Moments for Symmetric Distributions. (arXiv:2302.10844v2 [cs.DS] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10844</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of robustly estimating the mean or location parameter
without moment assumptions. We show that for a large class of symmetric
distributions, the same error as in the Gaussian setting can be achieved
efficiently. The distributions we study include products of arbitrary symmetric
one-dimensional distributions, such as product Cauchy distributions, as well as
elliptical distributions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For product distributions and elliptical distributions with known scatter
(covariance) matrix, we show that given an $\varepsilon$-corrupted sample, we
can with probability at least $1-\delta$ estimate its location up to error
$O(\varepsilon \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)})$ using $\tfrac{d\log(d) +
\log(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2 \log(1/\varepsilon)}$ samples. This result
matches the best-known guarantees for the Gaussian distribution and known SQ
lower bounds (up to the $\log(d)$ factor). For elliptical distributions with
unknown scatter (covariance) matrix, we propose a sequence of efficient
algorithms that approaches this optimal error. Specifically, for every $k \in
\mathbb{N}$, we design an estimator using time and samples $\tilde{O}({d^k})$
achieving error $O(\varepsilon^{1-\frac{1}{2k}})$. This matches the error and
running time guarantees when assuming certifiably bounded moments of order up
to $k$. For unknown covariance, such error bounds of $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$
are not even known for (general) sub-Gaussian distributions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our algorithms are based on a generalization of the well-known filtering
technique. We show how this machinery can be combined with Huber-loss-based
techniques to work with projections of the noise that behave more nicely than
the initial noise. Moreover, we show how SoS proofs can be used to obtain
algorithmic guarantees even for distributions without a first moment. We
believe that this approach may find other applications in future works.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08269</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning is a type of semi-supervised binary
classification where the machine learning algorithm differentiates between a
set of positive instances (labeled) and a set of both positive and negative
instances (unlabeled). PU learning has broad applications in settings where
confirmed negatives are unavailable or difficult to obtain, and there is value
in discovering positives among the unlabeled (e.g., viable drugs among untested
compounds). Most PU learning algorithms make the selected completely at random
(SCAR) assumption, namely that positives are selected independently of their
features. However, in many real-world applications, such as healthcare,
positives are not SCAR (e.g., severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed),
leading to a poor estimate of the proportion, $\alpha$, of positives among
unlabeled examples and poor model calibration, resulting in an uncertain
decision threshold for selecting positives. PU learning algorithms can estimate
$\alpha$ or the probability of an individual unlabeled instance being positive
or both. We propose two PU learning algorithms to estimate $\alpha$, calculate
calibrated probabilities for PU instances, and improve classification metrics:
i) PULSCAR (positive unlabeled learning selected completely at random), and ii)
PULSNAR (positive unlabeled learning selected not at random). PULSNAR uses a
divide-and-conquer approach that creates and solves several SCAR-like
sub-problems using PULSCAR. In our experiments, PULSNAR outperformed
state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmark
datasets.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15413</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Existing score-distilling text-to-3D generation techniques, despite their
considerable promise, often encounter the view inconsistency problem. One of
the most notable issues is the Janus problem, where the most canonical view of
an object (\textit{e.g}., face or head) appears in other views. In this work,
we explore existing frameworks for score-distilling text-to-3D generation and
identify the main causes of the view inconsistency problem -- the embedded bias
of 2D diffusion models. Based on these findings, we propose two approaches to
debias the score-distillation frameworks for view-consistent text-to-3D
generation. Our first approach, called score debiasing, involves cutting off
the score estimated by 2D diffusion models and gradually increasing the
truncation value throughout the optimization process. Our second approach,
called prompt debiasing, identifies conflicting words between user prompts and
view prompts using a language model, and adjusts the discrepancy between view
prompts and the viewing direction of an object. Our experimental results show
that our methods improve the realism of the generated 3D objects by
significantly reducing artifacts and achieve a good trade-off between
faithfulness to the 2D diffusion models and 3D consistency with little
overhead. Our project page is available

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the
reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal
brain MRI, where large and unpredictable fetal motion can lead to substantial
artifacts in the acquired images. Existing methods for fetal brain quality

picture of the quality of an image, that can only be achieved by looking at the
\textit{entire} brain volume. In this work, we propose FetMRQC, a machine
learning framework for automated image quality assessment tailored to fetal
brain MRI, which extracts an ensemble of quality metrics that are then used to
predict experts&apos; ratings. Based on the manual ratings of more than 1000
low-resolution stacks acquired across two different institutions, we show that,
compared with existing quality metrics, FetMRQC is able to generalize
out-of-domain, while being interpretable and data efficient. We also release a
novel manual quality rating tool designed to facilitate and optimize quality
rating of fetal brain images.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes refer to content synthesized using deep generators, which, when
misused, have the potential to erode trust in digital media. Synthesizing
high-quality deepfakes requires access to large and complex generators only a
few entities can train and provide. The threat is malicious users that exploit
access to the provided model and generate harmful deepfakes without risking
detection. Watermarking makes deepfakes detectable by embedding an identifiable
code into the generator that is later extractable from its generated images. We
propose Pivotal Tuning Watermarking (PTW), a method for watermarking
pre-trained generators (i) three orders of magnitude faster than watermarking
from scratch and (ii) without the need for any training data. We improve
existing watermarking methods and scale to generators $4 \times$ larger than
related work. PTW can embed longer codes than existing methods while better
preserving the generator&apos;s image quality. We propose rigorous, game-based
definitions for robustness and undetectability, and our study reveals that
watermarking is not robust against an adaptive white-box attacker who controls
the generator&apos;s parameters. We propose an adaptive attack that can successfully
remove any watermarking with access to only 200 non-watermarked images. Our
work challenges the trustworthiness of watermarking for deepfake detection when
the parameters of a generator are available. The source code to reproduce our
experiments is available at https://github.com/nilslukas/gan-watermark.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A generative AI model can generate extremely realistic-looking content,
posing growing challenges to the authenticity of information. To address the
challenges, watermark has been leveraged to detect AI-generated content.
Specifically, a watermark is embedded into an AI-generated content before it is
released. A content is detected as AI-generated if a similar watermark can be
decoded from it. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the robustness
of such watermark-based AI-generated content detection. We focus on
AI-generated images. Our work shows that an attacker can post-process a
watermarked image via adding a small, human-imperceptible perturbation to it,
such that the post-processed image evades detection while maintaining its
visual quality. We show the effectiveness of our attack both theoretically and
empirically. Moreover, to evade detection, our adversarial post-processing
method adds much smaller perturbations to AI-generated images and thus better
maintain their visual quality than existing popular post-processing methods
such as JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, and Brightness/Contrast. Our work
shows the insufficiency of existing watermark-based detection of AI-generated
content, highlighting the urgent needs of new methods. Our code is publicly

variety of decisions influencing the evaluation of GNNs at this task. To
address this, we propose a framework to establish a common evaluation protocol.
We motivate and justify it by demonstrating the differences with and without

the consistency of algorithm rankings to quantify the reliability of results
under the presence of randomness. We find that by ensuring the same evaluation
criteria is followed, there may be significant differences from the reported
performance of methods at this task, but a more complete evaluation and
comparison of methods is possible.

<title>Variational Classification. (arXiv:2305.10406v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10406</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a latent variable model for classification that provides a novel
probabilistic interpretation of neural network softmax classifiers. We derive a
variational objective to train the model, analogous to the evidence lower bound
(ELBO) used to train variational auto-encoders, that generalises the
cross-entropy loss used to train classification models. Treating inputs to the
softmax layer as samples of a latent variable, our abstracted perspective
reveals a potential inconsistency between their anticipated distribution,
required for accurate label predictions to be output, and the empirical
distribution found in practice. We augment the variational objective to
mitigate such inconsistency and encourage a chosen latent distribution, instead
of the implicit assumption in off-the-shelf softmax classifiers. Overall, we
provide new theoretical insight into the inner workings of widely-used softmax
classification. Empirical evaluation on image and text classification datasets
demonstrates that our proposed approach, variational classification, maintains
classification accuracy while the reshaped latent space improves other
desirable properties of a classifier, such as calibration, adversarial
robustness, robustness to distribution shift and sample efficiency useful in
low data settings.

<title>Federated Foundation Models: Privacy-Preserving and Collaborative Learning for Large Models. (arXiv:2305.11414v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11414</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Foundation Models (FMs), such as LLaMA, BERT, GPT, ViT, and CLIP, have
demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications, driven by
their ability to leverage vast amounts of data for pre-training. However,
optimizing FMs often requires access to sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns and limiting their applicability in many domains. In this paper, we
propose the Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) paradigm, which combines the
benefits of FMs and Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving and
collaborative learning across multiple end-users. We discuss the potential
benefits and challenges of integrating FL into the lifespan of FMs, covering
pre-training, fine-tuning, and application. We further outline potential future
research avenues in FFM, including FFM pre-training, FFM fine-tuning, and
federated prompt tuning, which allow the development of more personalized and
context-aware models while ensuring data privacy. Moreover, we explore the
possibility of continual/lifelong learning in FFMs, as increased computational
power at the edge may unlock the potential for optimizing FMs using newly
generated private data close to the data source. The proposed FFM concepts
offer a flexible and scalable framework for training large language models in a
privacy-preserving manner, setting the stage for subsequent advancements in
both FM training and federated learning.

<title>Fair Without Leveling Down: A New Intersectional Fairness Definition. (arXiv:2305.12495v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12495</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we consider the problem of intersectional group fairness in the
classification setting, where the objective is to learn discrimination-free
models in the presence of several intersecting sensitive groups. First, we
illustrate various shortcomings of existing fairness measures commonly used to
capture intersectional fairness. Then, we propose a new definition called the
$\alpha$-Intersectional Fairness, which combines the absolute and the relative
performance across sensitive groups and can be seen as a generalization of the
notion of differential fairness. We highlight several desirable properties of
the proposed definition and analyze its relation to other fairness measures.
Finally, we benchmark multiple popular in-processing fair machine learning
approaches using our new fairness definition and show that they do not achieve
any improvement over a simple baseline. Our results reveal that the increase in
fairness measured by previous definitions hides a &quot;leveling down&quot; effect, i.e.,
degrading the best performance over groups rather than improving the worst one.

<title>Hierarchical clustering with dot products recovers hidden tree structure. (arXiv:2305.15022v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15022</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper we offer a new perspective on the well established
agglomerative clustering algorithm, focusing on recovery of hierarchical
structure. We recommend a simple variant of the standard algorithm, in which
clusters are merged by maximum average dot product and not, for example, by
minimum distance or within-cluster variance. We demonstrate that the tree
output by this algorithm provides a bona fide estimate of generative
hierarchical structure in data, under a generic probabilistic graphical model.
The key technical innovations are to understand how hierarchical information in
this model translates into tree geometry which can be recovered from data, and
to characterise the benefits of simultaneously growing sample size and data
dimension. We demonstrate superior tree recovery performance with real data
over existing approaches such as UPGMA, Ward&apos;s method, and HDBSCAN.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15296</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The recent popularity of text-to-image diffusion models (DM) can largely be
attributed to the intuitive interface they provide to users. The intended
generation can be expressed in natural language, with the model producing
faithful interpretations of text prompts. However, expressing complex or
nuanced ideas in text alone can be difficult. To ease image generation, we
propose MultiFusion that allows one to express complex and nuanced concepts
with arbitrarily interleaved inputs of multiple modalities and languages.
MutliFusion leverages pre-trained models and aligns them for integration into a
cohesive system, thereby avoiding the need for extensive training from scratch.
Our experimental results demonstrate the efficient transfer of capabilities
from individual modules to the downstream model. Specifically, the fusion of
all independent components allows the image generation module to utilize
multilingual, interleaved multimodal inputs despite being trained solely on
monomodal data in a single language.

<title>Concept-Centric Transformers: Enhancing Model Interpretability through Object-Centric Concept Learning within a Shared Global Workspace. (arXiv:2305.15775v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15775</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Many interpretable AI approaches have been proposed to provide plausible
explanations for a model&apos;s decision-making. However, configuring an explainable
model that effectively communicates among computational modules has received
less attention. A recently proposed shared global workspace theory showed that
networks of distributed modules can benefit from sharing information with a
bottlenecked memory because the communication constraints encourage
specialization, compositionality, and synchronization among the modules.
Inspired by this, we propose Concept-Centric Transformers, a simple yet
effective configuration of the shared global workspace for interpretability,
consisting of: i) an object-centric-based memory module for extracting semantic
concepts from input features, ii) a cross-attention mechanism between the
learned concept and input embeddings, and iii) standard classification and
explanation losses to allow human analysts to directly assess an explanation
for the model&apos;s classification reasoning. We test our approach against other
existing concept-based methods on classification tasks for various datasets,
including CIFAR100, CUB-200-2011, and ImageNet, and we show that our model
achieves better classification accuracy than all baselines across all problems
but also generates more consistent concept-based explanations of classification
output.

<title>Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning in Mixed Systems through Augmented Samples and Its Applications to Queueing Networks. (arXiv:2305.16483v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16483</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper considers a class of reinforcement learning problems, which
involve systems with two types of states: stochastic and pseudo-stochastic. In
such systems, stochastic states follow a stochastic transition kernel while the
transitions of pseudo-stochastic states are deterministic given the stochastic
states/transitions. We refer to such systems as mixed systems, which are widely
used in various applications, including manufacturing systems, communication
networks, and queueing networks. We propose a sample efficient RL method that
accelerates learning by generating augmented data samples. The proposed
algorithm is data-driven and learns the policy from data samples from both real
and augmented samples. This method significantly improves learning by reducing
the sample complexity such that the dataset only needs to have sufficient
coverage of the stochastic states. We analyze the sample complexity of the
proposed method under Fitted Q Iteration (FQI) and demonstrate that the
optimality gap decreases as
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{{1}/{n}}+\sqrt{{1}/{m}}),$ where $n$ is the number
of real samples and $m$ is the number of augmented samples per real sample. It
is important to note that without augmented samples, the optimality gap is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ due to insufficient data coverage of the
pseudo-stochastic states. Our experimental results on multiple queueing network
applications confirm that the proposed method indeed significantly accelerates
learning in both deep Q-learning and deep policy gradient.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18869</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a method that enables language models to handle
complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler steps. Despite its
success, the underlying mechanics of CoT are not yet fully understood. In an
attempt to shed light on this, our study investigates the impact of CoT on the
ability of transformers to in-context learn a simple to study, yet general
family of compositional functions: multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). In this
setting, we find that the success of CoT can be attributed to breaking down
in-context learning of a compositional function into two distinct phases:
focusing on and filtering data related to each step of the composition and
in-context learning the single-step composition function. Through both
experimental and theoretical evidence, we demonstrate how CoT significantly
reduces the sample complexity of in-context learning (ICL) and facilitates the
learning of complex functions that non-CoT methods struggle with. Furthermore,
we illustrate how transformers can transition from vanilla in-context learning
to mastering a compositional function with CoT by simply incorporating
additional layers that perform the necessary data-filtering for CoT via the
attention mechanism. In addition to these test-time benefits, we show CoT helps
accelerate pretraining by learning shortcuts to represent complex functions and
filtering plays an important role in this process. These findings collectively
provide insights into the mechanics of CoT, inviting further investigation of
its role in complex reasoning tasks.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19254</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In an era of widespread web scraping, unlearnable dataset methods have the
potential to protect data privacy by preventing deep neural networks from
generalizing. But in addition to a number of practical limitations that make
their use unlikely, we make a number of findings that call into question their
ability to safeguard data. First, it is widely believed that neural networks
trained on unlearnable datasets only learn shortcuts, simpler rules that are
not useful for generalization. In contrast, we find that networks actually can
learn useful features that can be reweighed for high test performance,
suggesting that image protection is not assured. Unlearnable datasets are also
believed to induce learning shortcuts through linear separability of added
perturbations. We provide a counterexample, demonstrating that linear
separability of perturbations is not a necessary condition. To emphasize why
linearly separable perturbations should not be relied upon, we propose an
orthogonal projection attack which allows learning from unlearnable datasets
published in ICML 2021 and ICLR 2023. Our proposed attack is significantly less
complex than recently proposed techniques.

<title>Survival Instinct in Offline Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2306.03286v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03286</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a novel observation about the behavior of offline reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms: on many benchmark datasets, offline RL can produce
well-performing and safe policies even when trained with &quot;wrong&quot; reward labels,
such as those that are zero everywhere or are negatives of the true rewards.
This phenomenon cannot be easily explained by offline RL&apos;s return maximization
objective. Moreover, it gives offline RL a degree of robustness that is
uncharacteristic of its online RL counterparts, which are known to be sensitive
to reward design. We demonstrate that this surprising robustness property is
attributable to an interplay between the notion of pessimism in offline RL
algorithms and certain implicit biases in common data collection practices. As
we prove in this work, pessimism endows the agent with a &quot;survival instinct&quot;,
i.e., an incentive to stay within the data support in the long term, while the
limited and biased data coverage further constrains the set of survival
policies. Formally, given a reward class -- which may not even contain the true
reward -- we identify conditions on the training data distribution that enable
offline RL to learn a near-optimal and safe policy from any reward within the
class. We argue that the survival instinct should be taken into account when
interpreting results from existing offline RL benchmarks and when creating
future ones. Our empirical and theoretical results suggest a new paradigm for
RL, whereby an agent is nudged to learn a desirable behavior with imperfect
reward but purposely biased data coverage.

two important, but conflicting factors. In this work, we propose a

architecture, which not only obeys the underlying symmetries, but also enables
the reduction of number of tensor products by 92\%. In addition, QHNet prevents
the exponential growth of channel dimension when more atom types are involved.
We perform experiments on MD17 datasets, including four molecular systems.
Experimental results show that our QHNet can achieve comparable performance to
the state of the art methods at a significantly faster speed. Besides, our

Distance (FID), and the variants of Precision and Recall (P&amp;amp;R), heavily rely on
supports that are estimated from sample features. However, the reliability of
their estimation has not been seriously discussed (and overlooked) even though
the quality of the evaluation entirely depends on it. In this paper, we propose
Topological Precision and Recall (TopP&amp;amp;R, pronounced &apos;topper&apos;), which provides
a systematic approach to estimating supports, retaining only topologically and
statistically important features with a certain level of confidence. This not
only makes TopP&amp;amp;R strong for noisy features, but also provides statistical
consistency. Our theoretical and experimental results show that TopP&amp;amp;R is
robust to outliers and non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID)
perturbations, while accurately capturing the true trend of change in samples.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation metric focused on
the robust estimation of the support and provides its statistical consistency
under noise.

<title>More PAC-Bayes bounds: From bounded losses, to losses with general tail behaviors, to anytime-validity. (arXiv:2306.12214v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12214</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present new high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds for different
types of losses. Firstly, for losses with a bounded range, we recover a
strengthened version of Catoni&apos;s bound that holds uniformly for all parameter
values. This leads to new fast rate and mixed rate bounds that are
interpretable and tighter than previous bounds in the literature. In
particular, the fast rate bound is equivalent to the Seeger--Langford bound.
Secondly, for losses with more general tail behaviors, we introduce two new
parameter-free bounds: a PAC-Bayes Chernoff analogue when the loss&apos; cumulative
generating function is bounded, and a bound when the loss&apos; second moment is
bounded. These two bounds are obtained using a new technique based on a
discretization of the space of possible events for the &quot;in probability&quot;
parameter optimization problem. This technique is both simpler and more general
than previous approaches optimizing over a grid on the parameters&apos; space.
Finally, we extend all previous results to anytime-valid bounds using a simple
technique applicable to any existing bound.

<title>Pretraining task diversity and the emergence of non-Bayesian in-context learning for regression. (arXiv:2306.15063v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15063</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Pretrained transformers exhibit the remarkable ability of in-context learning
(ICL): they can learn tasks from just a few examples provided in the prompt
without updating any weights. This raises a foundational question: can ICL
solve fundamentally $\textit{new}$ tasks that are very different from those
seen during pretraining? To probe this question, we examine ICL&apos;s performance
on linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretraining
dataset. We empirically demonstrate a $\textit{task diversity threshold}$ for
the emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannot
solve unseen regression tasks, instead behaving like a Bayesian estimator with
the $\textit{non-diverse pretraining task distribution}$ as the prior. Beyond
this threshold, the transformer significantly outperforms this estimator; its
behavior aligns with that of ridge regression, corresponding to a Gaussian
prior over $\textit{all tasks}$, including those not seen during pretraining.
Thus, when pretrained on data with task diversity greater than the threshold,
transformers $\textit{can}$ optimally solve fundamentally new tasks in-context.
Importantly, this capability hinges on it deviating from the Bayes optimal
estimator with the pretraining distribution as the prior. This study also
explores the effect of regularization, model capacity and task structure and
underscores, in a concrete example, the critical role of task diversity,
alongside data and model scale, in the emergence of ICL. Code is available at

<title>Improving Fairness in Deepfake Detection. (arXiv:2306.16635v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16635</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the development of effective deepfake detectors in recent years,
recent studies have demonstrated that biases in the data used to train these
detectors can lead to disparities in detection accuracy across different races
and genders. This can result in different groups being unfairly targeted or
excluded from detection, allowing undetected deepfakes to manipulate public
opinion and erode trust in a deepfake detection model. While existing studies
have focused on evaluating fairness of deepfake detectors, to the best of our
knowledge, no method has been developed to encourage fairness in deepfake
detection at the algorithm level. In this work, we make the first attempt to
improve deepfake detection fairness by proposing novel loss functions that
handle both the setting where demographic information (eg, annotations of race
and gender) is available as well as the case where this information is absent.
Fundamentally, both approaches can be used to convert many existing deepfake
detectors into ones that encourages fairness. Extensive experiments on four
deepfake datasets and five deepfake detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our approach in improving deepfake detection fairness. Our code
is available at https://github.com/littlejuyan/DF_Fairness.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16750</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel value approximation method, namely Eigensubspace
Regularized Critic (ERC) for deep reinforcement learning (RL). ERC is motivated
by an analysis of the dynamics of Q-value approximation error in the
Temporal-Difference (TD) method, which follows a path defined by the
1-eigensubspace of the transition kernel associated with the Markov Decision
Process (MDP). It reveals a fundamental property of TD learning that has
remained unused in previous deep RL approaches. In ERC, we propose a
regularizer that guides the approximation error tending towards the
1-eigensubspace, resulting in a more efficient and stable path of value
approximation. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the ERC
method. Besides, theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that ERC
effectively reduces the variance of value functions. Among 26 tasks in the
DMControl benchmark, ERC outperforms state-of-the-art methods for 20. Besides,
it shows significant advantages in Q-value approximation and variance
reduction. Our code is available at https://sites.google.com/view/erc-ecml23/.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16838</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Kernel ridge regression, KRR, is a generalization of linear ridge regression
that is non-linear in the data, but linear in the parameters. Here, we
introduce an equivalent formulation of the objective function of KRR, opening
up both for using penalties other than the ridge penalty and for studying
kernel ridge regression from the perspective of gradient descent. Using a
continuous-time perspective, we derive a closed-form solution for solving
kernel regression with gradient descent, something we refer to as kernel
gradient flow, KGF, and theoretically bound the differences between KRR and
KGF, where, for the latter, regularization is obtained through early stopping.
We also generalize KRR by replacing the ridge penalty with the $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_\infty$ penalties, respectively, and use the fact that analogous to the
similarities between KGF and KRR, $\ell_1$ regularization and forward stagewise
regression (also known as coordinate descent), and $\ell_\infty$ regularization
and sign gradient descent, follow similar solution paths. We can thus alleviate
the need for computationally heavy algorithms based on proximal gradient
descent. We show theoretically and empirically how the $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_\infty$ penalties, and the corresponding gradient-based optimization
algorithms, produce sparse and robust kernel regression solutions,
respectively.

<title>Policy Space Diversity for Non-Transitive Games. (arXiv:2306.16884v2 [cs.GT] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16884</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is an influential algorithm framework
for approximating a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in multi-agent non-transitive games.
Many previous studies have been trying to promote policy diversity in PSRO. A
major weakness in existing diversity metrics is that a more diverse (according
to their diversity metrics) population does not necessarily mean (as we proved
in the paper) a better approximation to a NE. To alleviate this problem, we
propose a new diversity metric, the improvement of which guarantees a better
approximation to a NE. Meanwhile, we develop a practical and well-justified
method to optimize our diversity metric using only state-action samples. By
incorporating our diversity regularization into the best response solving in
PSRO, we obtain a new PSRO variant, Policy Space Diversity PSRO (PSD-PSRO). We
present the convergence property of PSD-PSRO. Empirically, extensive
experiments on various games demonstrate that PSD-PSRO is more effective in
producing significantly less exploitable policies than state-of-the-art PSRO
variants.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sequential data collection has emerged as a widely adopted technique for
enhancing the efficiency of data gathering processes. Despite its advantages,
such data collection mechanism often introduces complexities to the statistical
inference procedure. For instance, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator
in an adaptive linear regression model can exhibit non-normal asymptotic
behavior, posing challenges for accurate inference and interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a general method for constructing debiased estimator which
remedies this issue. It makes use of the idea of adaptive linear estimating
equations, and we establish theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality,
supplemented by discussions on achieving near-optimal asymptotic variance. A
salient feature of our estimator is that in the context of multi-armed bandits,
our estimator retains the non-asymptotic performance of the least square
estimator while obtaining asymptotic normality property. Consequently, this
work helps connect two fruitful paradigms of adaptive inference: a)
non-asymptotic inference using concentration inequalities and b) asymptotic
inference via asymptotic normality.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Many constraint satisfaction and optimisation problems can be solved
effectively by encoding them as instances of the Boolean Satisfiability problem
(SAT). However, even the simplest types of constraints have many encodings in
the literature with widely varying performance, and the problem of selecting
suitable encodings for a given problem instance is not trivial. We explore the
problem of selecting encodings for pseudo-Boolean and linear constraints using
a supervised machine learning approach. We show that it is possible to select
encodings effectively using a standard set of features for constraint problems;
however we obtain better performance with a new set of features specifically
designed for the pseudo-Boolean and linear constraints. In fact, we achieve
good results when selecting encodings for unseen problem classes. Our results
compare favourably to AutoFolio when using the same feature set. We discuss the
relative importance of instance features to the task of selecting the best
encodings, and compare several variations of the machine learning method.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09933</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;To avoid failures on out-of-distribution data, recent works have sought to
extract features that have an invariant or stable relationship with the label
across domains, discarding &quot;spurious&quot; or unstable features whose relationship
with the label changes across domains. However, unstable features often carry
complementary information that could boost performance if used correctly in the
test domain. In this work, we show how this can be done without test-domain
labels. In particular, we prove that pseudo-labels based on stable features
provide sufficient guidance for doing so, provided that stable and unstable
features are conditionally independent given the label. Based on this
theoretical insight, we propose Stable Feature Boosting (SFB), an algorithm
for: (i) learning a predictor that separates stable and
conditionally-independent unstable features; and (ii) using the stable-feature
predictions to adapt the unstable-feature predictions in the test domain.
Theoretically, we prove that SFB can learn an asymptotically-optimal predictor
without test-domain labels. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
SFB on real and synthetic data.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a
simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve
state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining
comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its
kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this
paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN&apos;s memory usage to be the
entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose
strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage.
Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by
$10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while
maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a
strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by
BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\mathbb{R}^{n
\times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the
form $f:\mathbb{R}^{n \times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. Thus, our
proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also
standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep
learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular
models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to solve Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which aims
to mitigate data distribution shifts when transferring knowledge from multiple
labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. We propose a novel MSDA
framework based on dictionary learning and optimal transport. We interpret each
domain in MSDA as an empirical distribution. As such, we express each domain as
a Wasserstein barycenter of dictionary atoms, which are empirical
distributions. We propose a novel algorithm, DaDiL, for learning via
mini-batches: (i) atom distributions; (ii) a matrix of barycentric coordinates.
Based on our dictionary, we propose two novel methods for MSDA: DaDil-R, based
on the reconstruction of labeled samples in the target domain, and DaDiL-E,
based on the ensembling of classifiers learned on atom distributions. We
evaluate our methods in 3 benchmarks: Caltech-Office, Office 31, and CRWU,
where we improved previous state-of-the-art by 3.15%, 2.29%, and 7.71% in

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep generative models can generate high-fidelity audio conditioned on
various types of representations (e.g., mel-spectrograms, Mel-frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)). Recently, such models have been used to
synthesize audio waveforms conditioned on highly compressed representations.
Although such methods produce impressive results, they are prone to generate
audible artifacts when the conditioning is flawed or imperfect. An alternative
modeling approach is to use diffusion models. However, these have mainly been
used as speech vocoders (i.e., conditioned on mel-spectrograms) or generating
relatively low sampling rate signals. In this work, we propose a high-fidelity
multi-band diffusion-based framework that generates any type of audio modality
(e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds) from low-bitrate discrete
representations. At equal bit rate, the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art generative techniques in terms of perceptual quality. Training

cues about object identity and box extremities. This naturally hinders the
recognition of complex or ambiguous interactions. In this work, we study these
issues through visualisations and carefully designed experiments. Accordingly,
we investigate how best to re-introduce image features via cross-attention.
With an improved query design, extensive exploration of keys and values, and
box pair positional embeddings as spatial guidance, our model with enhanced
predicate visual context (PViC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks, while maintaining low training cost.

<title>Conditional Sampling of Variational Autoencoders via Iterated Approximate Ancestral Sampling. (arXiv:2308.09078v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09078</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Conditional sampling of variational autoencoders (VAEs) is needed in various
applications, such as missing data imputation, but is computationally
intractable. A principled choice for asymptotically exact conditional sampling
is Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MWG). However, we observe that the tendency of VAEs
to learn a structured latent space, a commonly desired property, can cause the
MWG sampler to get &quot;stuck&quot; far from the target distribution. This paper
mitigates the limitations of MWG: we systematically outline the pitfalls in the
context of VAEs, propose two original methods that address these pitfalls, and
demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed methods on a set of
sampling tasks.

<title>Assessing the Generalization Gap of Learning-Based Speech Enhancement Systems in Noisy and Reverberant Environments. (arXiv:2309.06183v2 [eess.AS] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06183</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The acoustic variability of noisy and reverberant speech mixtures is
influenced by multiple factors, such as the spectro-temporal characteristics of
the target speaker and the interfering noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and the room characteristics. This large variability poses a major challenge
for learning-based speech enhancement systems, since a mismatch between the
training and testing conditions can substantially reduce the performance of the
system. Generalization to unseen conditions is typically assessed by testing
the system with a new speech, noise or binaural room impulse response (BRIR)
database different from the one used during training. However, the difficulty
of the speech enhancement task can change across databases, which can
substantially influence the results. The present study introduces a
generalization assessment framework that uses a reference model trained on the
test condition, such that it can be used as a proxy for the difficulty of the
test condition. This allows to disentangle the effect of the change in task
difficulty from the effect of dealing with new data, and thus to define a new
measure of generalization performance termed the generalization gap. The
procedure is repeated in a cross-validation fashion by cycling through multiple
speech, noise, and BRIR databases to accurately estimate the generalization
gap. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate the generalization potential
of a feedforward neural network (FFNN), Conv-TasNet, DCCRN and MANNER. We find
that for all models, the performance degrades the most in speech mismatches,
while good noise and room generalization can be achieved by training on
multiple databases. Moreover, while recent models show higher performance in
matched conditions, their performance substantially decreases in mismatched
conditions and can become inferior to that of the FFNN-based system.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this article, we propose an approach for federated domain adaptation, a
setting where distributional shift exists among clients and some have unlabeled
data. The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through
dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients&apos;
distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a
federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon
the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative
communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep
clients&apos; data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its
centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive
experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks.
Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other
benchmarks in federated domain adaptation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Oobleck enables resilient distributed training of large DNN models with
guaranteed fault tolerance. It takes a planning-execution co-design approach,
where it first generates a set of heterogeneous pipeline templates and
instantiates at least $f+1$ logically equivalent pipeline replicas to tolerate
any $f$ simultaneous failures. During execution, it relies on
already-replicated model states across the replicas to provide fast recovery.
Oobleck provably guarantees that some combination of the initially created
pipeline templates can be used to cover all available resources after $f$ or
fewer simultaneous failures, thereby avoiding resource idling at all times.
Evaluation on large DNN models with billions of parameters shows that Oobleck
provides consistently high throughput, and it outperforms state-of-the-art

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08589</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models have astounded the world with fascinating new
capabilities. However, they currently lack the ability to teach themselves new
skills, relying instead on large amounts of human-generated training data. We
introduce SECToR (Self-Education via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning), a
proof-of-concept demonstration that language models can teach themselves new
skills using chain-of-thought reasoning. During the self-learning loop, SECToR
asks models to solve addition problems using chain-of-thought reasoning before
training the next version of the model to solve those same problems directly
without using such reasoning. This process often results in an improved model
which can, when again augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning, solve even
harder problems than the original model, allowing the self-learning loop to
continue. Language models trained via SECToR autonomously learn to add up to
the longest-length-digit numbers without access to any ground truth examples
beyond an initial supervised fine-tuning phase consisting only of numbers with
6 or fewer digits. Our central hypothesis is that chain-of-thought reasoning
can act as a policy improvement operator, similarly to how Monte-Carlo Tree
Search is used in AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017). We hope that this research
can lead to new directions in which language models can learn to teach
themselves without the need for human demonstrations.

Collinear Constrained Attention (CoCA). We&apos;ve analyzed the computational and
spatial complexity of CoCA and have determined that it adds only minimal
additional overhead compared to the original Transformer-based models. We
provide an efficient implementation of CoCA, and make it drop-in replacement
for any existing position embedding and attention modules in Transformer based
models. Experiments show that CoCA performs extraordinary well on context

This indicates more than 16x context window extending without any fine-tuning.

<title>PDFTriage: Question Answering over Long, Structured Documents. (arXiv:2309.08872v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08872</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have issues with document question answering
(QA) in situations where the document is unable to fit in the small context
length of an LLM. To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on
retrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain
text. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are
naturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on.
Representing such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the
user&apos;s mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has
to query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and
seemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this
fundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called
PDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure
or content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
PDFTriage-augmented models across several classes of questions where existing
retrieval-augmented LLMs fail. To facilitate further research on this
fundamental problem, we release our benchmark dataset consisting of 900+
human-generated questions over 80 structured documents from 10 different
categories of question types for document QA. Our code and datasets will be
released soon on Github.

<title>AnglE-optimized Text Embeddings. (arXiv:2309.12871v6 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12871</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textual
similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model
(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models
face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on
the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly
collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine
domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various
tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.
The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models
that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability
of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle
optimization in STS.

eosinphils using deep image segmentation. Our new approach leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout, a common approach in deep learning to reduce overfitting, to
provide uncertainty quantification on current deep learning models. The
uncertainty can be visualized in an output image to evaluate model performance,

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00034</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper explores network binarization, a radical form of quantization,
compressing model weights to a single bit, specifically for Large Language
Models (LLMs) compression. Due to previous binarization methods collapsing
LLMs, we propose a novel approach, Partially-Binarized LLM (PB-LLM), which can
achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning
capacity of quantized LLMs. Specifically, our exploration first uncovers the
ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and
highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit
quantization. Thus, PB-LLM filters a small ratio of salient weights during
binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e.,
partially-binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover the capacities of
quantized LMMs, by analyzing from the perspective of post-training quantization
(PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). Under PTQ, combining the concepts
from GPTQ, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the Hessian
matrix and successfully recover the reasoning capacity of PB-LLM in low-bit.
Under QAT, we freeze the salient weights during training, explore the
derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization
error, and propose a scaling mechanism based on this derived scaling strategy
for residual binarized weights. Those explorations and the developed
methodologies significantly contribute to rejuvenating the performance of
low-bit quantized LLMs and present substantial advancements in the field of
network binarization for LLMs.The code is available at

<title>The Geometric Structure of Fully-Connected ReLU Layers. (arXiv:2310.03482v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03482</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We formalize and interpret the geometric structure of $d$-dimensional fully
connected ReLU layers in neural networks. The parameters of a ReLU layer induce
a natural partition of the input domain, such that the ReLU layer can be
significantly simplified in each sector of the partition. This leads to a
geometric interpretation of a ReLU layer as a projection onto a polyhedral cone
followed by an affine transformation, in line with the description in
[doi:10.48550/arXiv.&lt;a href=&quot;/abs/1905.08922&quot;&gt;1905.08922&lt;/a&gt;] for convolutional networks with ReLU
activations. Further, this structure facilitates simplified expressions for
preimages of the intersection between partition sectors and hyperplanes, which
is useful when describing decision boundaries in a classification setting. We
investigate this in detail for a feed-forward network with one hidden
ReLU-layer, where we provide results on the geometric complexity of the
decision boundary generated by such networks, as well as proving that modulo an
affine transformation, such a network can only generate $d$ different decision
boundaries. Finally, the effect of adding more layers to the network is
discussed.

<title>PyDCM: Custom Data Center Models with Reinforcement Learning for Sustainability. (arXiv:2310.03906v6 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03906</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The increasing global emphasis on sustainability and reducing carbon
emissions is pushing governments and corporations to rethink their approach to
data center design and operation. Given their high energy consumption and
exponentially large computational workloads, data centers are prime candidates
for optimizing power consumption, especially in areas such as cooling and IT
energy usage. A significant challenge in this pursuit is the lack of a
configurable and scalable thermal data center model that offers an end-to-end
pipeline. Data centers consist of multiple IT components whose geometric
configuration and heat dissipation make thermal modeling difficult. This paper
presents PyDCM, a customizable Data Center Model implemented in Python, that
allows users to create unique configurations of IT equipment with custom server
specifications and geometric arrangements of IT cabinets. The use of vectorized
thermal calculations makes PyDCM orders of magnitude faster (30 times) than
current Energy Plus modeling implementations and scales sublinearly with the
number of CPUs. Also, PyDCM enables the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning via
the Gymnasium wrapper to optimize data center cooling and offers a
user-friendly platform for testing various data center design prototypes.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03912</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Optimization (BO), guided by Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, has
proven to be an invaluable technique for efficient, high-dimensional, black-box
optimization, a critical problem inherent to many applications such as
industrial design and scientific computing. Recent contributions have
introduced reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the optimization performance
on both single function optimization and \textit{few-shot} multi-objective
optimization. However, even few-shot techniques fail to exploit similarities
shared between closely related objectives. In this paper, we combine recent
developments in Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and attention-based Transformer
models to improve the modeling powers of GP surrogates with meta-learning. We
propose a novel method for improving meta-learning BO surrogates by
incorporating attention mechanisms into DKL, empowering the surrogates to adapt
to contextual information gathered during the BO process. We combine this
Transformer Deep Kernel with a learned acquisition function trained with
continuous Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning to aid in exploration. This
Reinforced Transformer Deep Kernel (RTDK-BO) approach yields state-of-the-art
results in continuous high-dimensional optimization problems.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are a groundbreaking technology for
interacting with external devices using brain signals. Despite advancements,
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (MI) tasks face challenges like

for smaller model size and faster inference. This study introduces the LGL-BCI
framework, employing a Geometric Deep Learning Framework for EEG processing in
non-Euclidean metric spaces, particularly the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
Manifold space. LGL-BCI offers robust EEG data representation and captures
spatial correlations. We propose an EEG channel selection solution via a

lossless transformation boosting inference speed. Extensive experiments show
LGL-BCI&apos;s superior accuracy and efficiency compared to current solutions,
highlighting geometric deep learning&apos;s potential in MI-BCI applications. The
efficiency, assessed on two public EEG datasets and two real-world EEG devices,
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in accuracy ($82.54\%$

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08759</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Question Answering (QA) systems on patient-related data can assist both
clinicians and patients. They can, for example, assist clinicians in
decision-making and enable patients to have a better understanding of their
medical history. Significant amounts of patient data are stored in Electronic
Health Records (EHRs), making EHR QA an important research area. In EHR QA, the
answer is obtained from the medical record of the patient. Because of the
differences in data format and modality, this differs greatly from other
medical QA tasks that employ medical websites or scientific papers to retrieve
answers, making it critical to research EHR question answering. This study
aimed to provide a methodological review of existing works on QA over EHRs. We
searched for articles from January 1st, 2005 to September 30th, 2023 in four
digital sources including Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, ACM Digital Library,
and PubMed to collect relevant publications on EHR QA. 4111 papers were
identified for our study, and after screening based on our inclusion criteria,
we obtained a total of 47 papers for further study. Out of the 47 papers, 25
papers were about EHR QA datasets, and 37 papers were about EHR QA models. It
was observed that QA on EHRs is relatively new and unexplored. Most of the
works are fairly recent. Also, it was observed that emrQA is by far the most
popular EHR QA dataset, both in terms of citations and usage in other papers.
Furthermore, we identified the different models used in EHR QA along with the
evaluation metrics used for these models.

<title>Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback. (arXiv:2310.13032v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13032</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In many text-generation problems, users may prefer not only a single
response, but a diverse range of high-quality outputs from which to choose.
Quality-diversity (QD) search algorithms aim at such outcomes, by continually
improving and diversifying a population of candidates. However, the
applicability of QD to qualitative domains, like creative writing, has been
limited by the difficulty of algorithmically specifying measures of quality and
diversity. Interestingly, recent developments in language models (LMs) have
enabled guiding search through AI feedback, wherein LMs are prompted in natural
language to evaluate qualitative aspects of text. Leveraging this development,
we introduce Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF), wherein an
evolutionary algorithm applies LMs to both generate variation and evaluate the
quality and diversity of candidate text. When assessed on creative writing
domains, QDAIF covers more of a specified search space with high-quality
samples than do non-QD controls. Further, human evaluation of QDAIF-generated
creative texts validates reasonable agreement between AI and human evaluation.
Our results thus highlight the potential of AI feedback to guide open-ended
search for creative and original solutions, providing a recipe that seemingly
generalizes to many domains and modalities. In this way, QDAIF is a step
towards AI systems that can independently search, diversify, evaluate, and
improve, which are among the core skills underlying human society&apos;s capacity
for innovation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Since the seminal work of [9] and their Physics-Informed neural networks
(PINNs), many efforts have been conducted towards solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) with Deep Learning models. However, some challenges remain,
for instance the extension of such models to complex three-dimensional
geometries, and a study on how such approaches could be combined to classical
numerical solvers. In this work, we justify the use of graph neural networks
for these problems, based on the similarity between these architectures and the
meshes used in traditional numerical techniques for solving partial
differential equations. After proving an issue with the Physics-Informed
framework for complex geometries, during the computation of PDE residuals, an
alternative procedure is proposed, by combining classical numerical solvers and
the Physics-Informed framework. Finally, we propose an implementation of this

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have greatly enhanced the perception
capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) by enabling information
sharing to &quot;see through the occlusions&quot;, resulting in significant performance

models show remarkable generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
new framework termed MACP, which equips a single-agent pre-trained model with
cooperation capabilities. We approach this objective by identifying the key
challenges of shifting from single-agent to cooperative settings, adapting the
model by freezing most of its parameters and adding a few lightweight modules.
We demonstrate in our experiments that the proposed framework can effectively
utilize cooperative observations and outperform other state-of-the-art
approaches in both simulated and real-world cooperative perception benchmarks
while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters with reduced

<title>Streaming Factor Trajectory Learning for Temporal Tensor Decomposition. (arXiv:2310.17021v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17021</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Practical tensor data is often along with time information. Most existing
temporal decomposition approaches estimate a set of fixed factors for the
objects in each tensor mode, and hence cannot capture the temporal evolution of
the objects&apos; representation. More important, we lack an effective approach to
capture such evolution from streaming data, which is common in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose Streaming Factor Trajectory
Learning for temporal tensor decomposition. We use Gaussian processes (GPs) to
model the trajectory of factors so as to flexibly estimate their temporal
evolution. To address the computational challenges in handling streaming data,
we convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent
stochastic differential equation (SDE). We develop an efficient online
filtering algorithm to estimate a decoupled running posterior of the involved
factor states upon receiving new data. The decoupled estimation enables us to
conduct standard Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing to compute the full posterior of
all the trajectories in parallel, without the need for revisiting any previous
data. We have shown the advantage of SFTL in both synthetic tasks and
real-world applications. The code is available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18471</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Causal representation learning algorithms discover lower-dimensional
representations of data that admit a decipherable interpretation of cause and
effect; as achieving such interpretable representations is challenging, many
causal learning algorithms utilize elements indicating prior information, such
as (linear) structural causal models, interventional data, or weak supervision.
Unfortunately, in exploratory causal representation learning, such elements and
prior information may not be available or warranted. Alternatively, scientific
datasets often have multiple modalities or physics-based constraints, and the
use of such scientific, multimodal data has been shown to improve
disentanglement in fully unsupervised settings. Consequently, we introduce a
causal representation learning algorithm (causalPIMA) that can use multimodal
data and known physics to discover important features with causal
relationships. Our innovative algorithm utilizes a new differentiable
parametrization to learn a directed acyclic graph (DAG) together with a latent
space of a variational autoencoder in an end-to-end differentiable framework
via a single, tractable evidence lower bound loss function. We place a Gaussian
mixture prior on the latent space and identify each of the mixtures with an
outcome of the DAG nodes; this novel identification enables feature discovery
with causal relationships. Tested against a synthetic and a scientific dataset,
our results demonstrate the capability of learning an interpretable causal
structure while simultaneously discovering key features in a fully unsupervised
setting.

users to customize the types of distortions to be optimally applied to images,
which helps address the specific distortions relevant to their deployment. The

even when these models are adversarially retrained using state-of-the-art
techniques, demonstrating the generalizability of our adversarial samples. We
achieve competitive performance in terms of net $L_2$ distortion compared to
state-of-the-art benchmark techniques on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet; however, we
demonstrate our framework achieves such results with simple distortions like
Gaussian noise without introducing unnatural artifacts or color bleeds. This is
made possible by a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent and a
technique that reduces a deep tree search of the image for model sensitivity to
perturbations, to a one-level analysis and action. The flexibility of choosing
distortions and setting classification probability thresholds for multiple
classes makes our framework suitable for algorithmic audits.

<title>Foundation Models for Generalist Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. (arXiv:2310.18660v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18660</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Significant progress in the development of highly adaptable and reusable
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is expected to have a significant impact on
Earth science and remote sensing. Foundation models are pre-trained on large
unlabeled datasets through self-supervision, and then fine-tuned for various
downstream tasks with small labeled datasets. This paper introduces a
first-of-a-kind framework for the efficient pre-training and fine-tuning of
foundational models on extensive geospatial data. We have utilized this
framework to create Prithvi, a transformer-based geospatial foundational model
pre-trained on more than 1TB of multispectral satellite imagery from the
Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel 2 (HLS) dataset. Our study demonstrates the
efficacy of our framework in successfully fine-tuning Prithvi to a range of
Earth observation tasks that have not been tackled by previous work on
foundation models involving multi-temporal cloud gap imputation, flood mapping,
wildfire scar segmentation, and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Our
experiments show that the pre-trained model accelerates the fine-tuning process
compared to leveraging randomly initialized weights. In addition, pre-trained
Prithvi compares well against the state-of-the-art, e.g., outperforming a
conditional GAN model in multi-temporal cloud imputation by up to 5pp (or 5.7%)
in the structural similarity index. Finally, due to the limited availability of
labeled data in the field of Earth observation, we gradually reduce the
quantity of available labeled data for refining the model to evaluate data
efficiency and demonstrate that data can be decreased significantly without
affecting the model&apos;s accuracy. The pre-trained 100 million parameter model and
corresponding fine-tuning workflows have been released publicly as open source
contributions to the global Earth sciences community through Hugging Face.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a self-correction mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
mitigate issues such as toxicity and fact hallucination. This method involves
refining model outputs through an ensemble of critics and the model&apos;s own

emulate the self-correction process observed in humans who often engage in
self-reflection and seek input from others to refine their understanding of
complex topics. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be applied across
various domains to enhance trustworthiness by addressing fairness, bias, and
robustness concerns. We consistently observe performance improvements in LLMs

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19802</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We have formulated generative machine learning problems as the time evolution
of Parametric Probabilistic Models (PPMs), inherently rendering a thermodynamic
process. Then, we have studied the thermodynamic exchange between the model&apos;s
parameters, denoted as $\Theta$, and the model&apos;s generated samples, denoted as
$X$. We demonstrate that the training dataset and the action of the Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer serve as a work source that governs the time
evolution of these two subsystems. Our findings reveal that the model learns
through the dissipation of heat during the generation of samples $X$, leading
to an increase in the entropy of the model&apos;s parameters, $\Theta$. Thus, the
parameter subsystem acts as a heat reservoir, effectively storing the learned
information. Furthermore, the role of the model&apos;s parameters as a heat
reservoir provides valuable thermodynamic insights into the generalization
power of over-parameterized models. This approach offers an unambiguous
framework for computing information-theoretic quantities within deterministic
neural networks by establishing connections with thermodynamic variables. To
illustrate the utility of this framework, we introduce two
information-theoretic metrics: Memorized-information (M-info) and
Learned-information (L-info), which trace the dynamic flow of information
during the learning process of PPMs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Closed drafting or &quot;pick and pass&quot; is a popular game mechanic where each
round players select a card or other playable element from their hand and pass

rules to interpret the strategy of trained RL agents and compare these to the
ranking preferences of different types of human players, finding easily
understandable explanations of the disparate performance of RL agents in this
environment. As Sushi Go Party! can be expressed as a set of closely-related
games based on the set of cards in play, we quantify the generalizability of RL
models trained on various sets of cards, establishing key trends between
performance and the set distance between the train and evaluation game
configurations. Using the explicitly calculable memory of other player&apos;s hands

<title>Robust Graph Clustering via Meta Weighting for Noisy Graphs. (arXiv:2311.00322v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00322</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;How can we find meaningful clusters in a graph robustly against noise edges?
Graph clustering (i.e., dividing nodes into groups of similar ones) is a
fundamental problem in graph analysis with applications in various fields.
Recent studies have demonstrated that graph neural network (GNN) based
approaches yield promising results for graph clustering. However, we observe
that their performance degenerates significantly on graphs with noise edges,
which are prevalent in practice. In this work, we propose MetaGC for robust
GNN-based graph clustering. MetaGC employs a decomposable clustering loss
function, which can be rephrased as a sum of losses over node pairs. We add a
learnable weight to each node pair, and MetaGC adaptively adjusts the weights
of node pairs using meta-weighting so that the weights of meaningful node pairs
increase and the weights of less-meaningful ones (e.g., noise edges) decrease.
We show empirically that MetaGC learns weights as intended and consequently
outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based competitors, even when they are
equipped with separate denoising schemes, on five real-world graphs under
varying levels of noise. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/HyeonsooJo/MetaGC.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Data-driven techniques are increasingly used to replace electronic-structure
calculations of matter. In this context, a relevant question is whether machine
learning (ML) should be applied directly to predict the desired properties or
be combined explicitly with physically-grounded operations. We present an
example of an integrated modeling approach, in which a symmetry-adapted ML
model of an effective Hamiltonian is trained to reproduce electronic
excitations from a quantum-mechanical calculation. The resulting model can make
predictions for molecules that are much larger and more complex than those that
it is trained on, and allows for dramatic computational savings by indirectly
targeting the outputs of well-converged calculations while using a
parameterization corresponding to a minimal atom-centered basis. These results
emphasize the merits of intertwining data-driven techniques with physical
approximations, improving the transferability and interpretability of ML models
without affecting their accuracy and computational efficiency, and providing a
blueprint for developing ML-augmented electronic-structure methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;People are relying on AI agents to assist them with various tasks. The human
must know when to rely on the agent, collaborate with the agent, or ignore its

collaborate with the AI. Our novel region discovery algorithm finds local
regions in the data as neighborhoods in an embedding space where prior human
behavior should be corrected. Each region is then described using a large
language model in an iterative and contrastive procedure. We then teach these
rules to the human via an onboarding stage. Through user studies on object

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The Laplace&apos;s method approximates a target density with a Gaussian
distribution at its mode. It is computationally efficient and asymptotically
exact for Bayesian inference due to the Bernstein-von Mises theorem, but for
complex targets and finite-data posteriors it is often too crude an
approximation. A recent generalization of the Laplace Approximation transforms
the Gaussian approximation according to a chosen Riemannian geometry providing
a richer approximation family, while still retaining computational efficiency.
However, as shown here, its properties heavily depend on the chosen metric,
indeed the metric adopted in previous work results in approximations that are
overly narrow as well as being biased even at the limit of infinite data. We
correct this shortcoming by developing the approximation family further,
deriving two alternative variants that are exact at the limit of infinite data,
extending the theoretical analysis of the method, and demonstrating practical
improvements in a range of experiments.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce a text-to-speech(TTS) framework based on a neural transducer. We
use discretized semantic tokens acquired from wav2vec2.0 embeddings, which
makes it easy to adopt a neural transducer for the TTS framework enjoying its
monotonic alignment constraints. The proposed model first generates aligned
semantic tokens using the neural transducer, then synthesizes a speech sample
from the semantic tokens using a non-autoregressive(NAR) speech generator. This
decoupled framework alleviates the training complexity of TTS and allows each
stage to focus on 1) linguistic and alignment modeling and 2) fine-grained
acoustic modeling, respectively. Experimental results on the zero-shot adaptive
TTS show that the proposed model exceeds the baselines in speech quality and
speaker similarity via objective and subjective measures. We also investigate
the inference speed and prosody controllability of our proposed model, showing
the potential of the neural transducer for TTS frameworks.

<title>Multitask Kernel-based Learning with First-Order Logic Constraints. (arXiv:2311.03340v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03340</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper we propose a general framework to integrate supervised and
unsupervised examples with background knowledge expressed by a collection of
first-order logic clauses into kernel machines. In particular, we consider a
multi-task learning scheme where multiple predicates defined on a set of
objects are to be jointly learned from examples, enforcing a set of FOL
constraints on the admissible configurations of their values. The predicates
are defined on the feature spaces, in which the input objects are represented,
and can be either known a priori or approximated by an appropriate kernel-based
learner. A general approach is presented to convert the FOL clauses into a
continuous implementation that can deal with the outputs computed by the
kernel-based predicates. The learning problem is formulated as a
semi-supervised task that requires the optimization in the primal of a loss
function that combines a fitting loss measure on the supervised examples, a
regularization term, and a penalty term that enforces the constraints on both
the supervised and unsupervised examples. Unfortunately, the penalty term is
not convex and it can hinder the optimization process. However, it is possible
to avoid poor solutions by using a two stage learning schema, in which the
supervised examples are learned first and then the constraints are enforced.

<title>ProPath: Disease-Specific Protein Language Model for Variant Pathogenicity. (arXiv:2311.03429v2 [q-bio.GN] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03429</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Clinical variant classification of pathogenic versus benign genetic variants
remains a pivotal challenge in clinical genetics. Recently, the proposition of
protein language models has improved the generic variant effect prediction
(VEP) accuracy via weakly-supervised or unsupervised training. However, these
VEPs are not disease-specific, limiting their adaptation at point-of-care. To
address this problem, we propose a disease-specific \textsc{pro}tein language
model for variant \textsc{path}ogenicity, termed ProPath, to capture the
pseudo-log-likelihood ratio in rare missense variants through a siamese
network. We evaluate the performance of ProPath against pre-trained language
models, using clinical variant sets in inherited cardiomyopathies and
arrhythmias that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that
ProPath surpasses the pre-trained ESM1b with an over $5\%$ improvement in AUC
across both datasets. Furthermore, our model achieved the highest performances
across all baselines for both datasets. Thus, our ProPath offers a potent
disease-specific variant effect prediction, particularly valuable for disease
associations and clinical applicability.

<title>UP-NeRF: Unconstrained Pose-Prior-Free Neural Radiance Fields. (arXiv:2311.03784v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03784</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has enabled novel view synthesis with high
fidelity given images and camera poses. Subsequent works even succeeded in
eliminating the necessity of pose priors by jointly optimizing NeRF and camera
pose. However, these works are limited to relatively simple settings such as
photometrically consistent and occluder-free image collections or a sequence of
images from a video. So they have difficulty handling unconstrained images with
varying illumination and transient occluders. In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{UP-NeRF}$ ($\textbf{U}$nconstrained $\textbf{P}$ose-prior-free
$\textbf{Ne}$ural $\textbf{R}$adiance $\textbf{F}$ields) to optimize NeRF with
unconstrained image collections without camera pose prior. We tackle these
challenges with surrogate tasks that optimize color-insensitive feature fields
and a separate module for transient occluders to block their influence on pose
estimation. In addition, we introduce a candidate head to enable more robust
pose estimation and transient-aware depth supervision to minimize the effect of
incorrect prior. Our experiments verify the superior performance of our method
compared to the baselines including BARF and its variants in a challenging
internet photo collection, $\textit{Phototourism}$ dataset.

<title>Learned Causal Method Prediction. (arXiv:2311.03989v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03989</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;For a given causal question, it is important to efficiently decide which
causal inference method to use for a given dataset. This is challenging because
causal methods typically rely on complex and difficult-to-verify assumptions,
and cross-validation is not applicable since ground truth causal quantities are
unobserved. In this work, we propose CAusal Method Predictor (CAMP), a
framework for predicting the best method for a given dataset. To this end, we
generate datasets from a diverse set of synthetic causal models, score the
candidate methods, and train a model to directly predict the highest-scoring
method for that dataset. Next, by formulating a self-supervised pre-training
objective centered on dataset assumptions relevant for causal inference, we
significantly reduce the need for costly labeled data and enhance training
efficiency. Our strategy learns to map implicit dataset properties to the best
method in a data-driven manner. In our experiments, we focus on method
prediction for causal discovery. CAMP outperforms selecting any individual
candidate method and demonstrates promising generalization to unseen
semi-synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
